# Legal Sentiment Analysis - Code Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CRITICAL BUG FIXES
- **Fixed function signature mismatch in `run_evaluation.py`**: The call to `prepare_legal_sentiment_data()` was using wrong parameters that would cause runtime errors.
- **Fixed broken regex patterns in `clean_text()`**: The text cleaning function had incorrectly escaped regex patterns that weren't working.

### 2. REMOVED REDUNDANT/UNUSED CODE
- **Removed unused imports**:
  - `import os` and `import pandas as pd` from `ibm_cos_utils.py`
  - `import json` from `legal_sentiment_evaluation.py`

### 3. IMPROVED ERROR HANDLING
- **Added comprehensive error handling to `extract_cases()`**: Now handles JSON parsing errors, file read errors, and missing directories.
- **Added file existence checks**: Validates that JSON directory exists before processing.
- **Improved temporary file handling**: Uses proper temporary files with automatic cleanup in COS upload.

### 4. ENHANCED FUNCTIONALITY
- **Added main execution block**: `data_preparation_script.py` can now be run as a standalone script.
- **Fixed hardcoded paths**: Removed absolute paths and made them configurable.
- **Added batching support**: All prediction functions now support batch processing for better memory management.
- **Improved device detection**: Created reusable device detection utility function.

### 5. STANDARDIZED TEXT PROCESSING
- **Consistent text truncation**: Standardized text length limits across different models.
- **Better sentiment label mapping**: Improved parsing of different sentiment model outputs.
- **Enhanced prompt engineering**: Simplified and more effective prompts for LLM models.

### 6. CODE ORGANIZATION
- **Created configuration file**: Centralized all constants and configuration parameters in `config.py`.
- **Updated requirements.txt**: Added proper version specifications and missing dependencies.
- **Better progress tracking**: Added batch processing progress indicators.

## Files Modified

1. **`run_evaluation.py`**: Fixed critical function call bug
2. **`data_preparation_script.py`**: Added error handling, fixed regex, added main block
3. **`ibm_cos_utils.py`**: Removed unused imports
4. **`legal_sentiment_evaluation.py`**: Removed unused import, improved temp file handling, added batching
5. **`legal_sentiment_evaluation_hf.py`**: Improved device detection, better error handling, enhanced prompts
6. **`requirements.txt`**: Added version specifications and missing dependencies
7. **`config.py`**: NEW - Centralized configuration file

## Performance Improvements

- **Memory efficiency**: Batch processing prevents memory overload with large datasets
- **Better error recovery**: Graceful handling of individual file processing failures
- **GPU utilization**: Improved device detection and utilization
- **Consistent output**: Standardized sentiment label mappings across all models

## Security & Robustness

- **Proper temp file handling**: Prevents file system pollution and security issues
- **Input validation**: Better validation of text inputs and file paths
- **Error isolation**: Individual file processing errors don't crash entire pipeline

## How to Use the Improved Code

1. **Run data preparation**: `python data_preparation_script.py`
2. **Run HuggingFace evaluation**: `python run_evaluation_hf.py`
3. **Run IBM Watson evaluation**: `python run_evaluation.py` (after setting environment variables)

All scripts now have better error messages and progress tracking.
