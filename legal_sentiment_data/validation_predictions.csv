elivere the opinion of the Court.
The complainant by his bill alleges that the efenants an himself entere into an agreement of co-partnership for the purpose of erecting a am an saw mill, upon a certain tract- of lan then belongiug to the government, but which was to be entere by them in tKeir joint names, each partner avancing his equal portion of the purchase money, All the partners were to ai in constructing the mill, an an account was to be kept of the work one, materials furnishe, an money expene by each. The complainant being a mill-wright, was to o an superinten that portion of the work. That in case either partner shoul become issatisfie by the time the mill was put into operation, or before, he shoul not then be consiere a partner any longer, but shoul be pai what was ue him by the concern. That the parties proceee with the erection of the mill an am, in which the complainant was engage uring several months, when he iscovere that one of the efenants, with the privity of the other, ha gone to the istrict lan office, an claime an obtaine a pre-emption right to the tract of lan on which the mill was situate, thereby preventing for the term of one year, the entry of it, pursuant to their agreement, an the efenants then refuse to recognize him as a partner, an force him to abanon the work. That besies his labor bestowe in assisting to erect the mill, he ha expene various small sums of money of which an account was exhibite. That he was entitle as a partner, to one-thir share in the mill, an praye for iscovery, an an account an settlement of the partnership affairs, that the property might be sol an the procees ivie amongst the partners accoring as the amount ue to each might be ascertaine.
The efenants, in their answer, profess to annex an setforth by way of exhibit, an account of the labor an money expene by them in erecting the mill, an also an account of moneys owing to them by the complainant, but no such exhibits appear in the transcript before us. But in orer to reach what seems to be the only question presente in the case, it will be sufficient to state, that the answer an the epositions taken on both sies isclose substantially the following facts. That there was a verbal agreement to erect the mill an enter thelan in partnership, though iffering in several respects from that allege by the complainant. That the complainant i expen some money, an work at intervals an inifferently well uring several months. That the efenants loge in the lan office, a claim to a preemption right upon the tract in question, not with any esign to efrau the complainant, but to prevent any other person from entering it, an until such time as the partners coul spare the money to enter it, an that the transaction was so explaine to the complainant. • That the complainant quit work an abanone the partnership without any just cause for issatisfaction an against the wishes of the efenants,, who requeste him to continue. That the work one by the complainant was of some value to the efenants, who remaine in possession of the property, an when the complainant left the mill in an unfinishe state, hire another mill-wright an went on to complete it.
Upon the hearing, the court below ismisse the bill for want of equity, an upon the whole case, the appellant has no right to complain of the ecree, so far as it enies to him any right as a partner to an interest in the specific property. But it oes appear that something is ue to him from the efenants, or at least, that he is equitably entitle to have an account taken, an a ecree in his favor, for what may be foun to be justly ue, an upon the statement of such account, both parties will be at liberty to make proof of their emans.
The abanonment by the complainant of the unertaking worke a issolution of the copartnership, but there was nothingin his conuct from which any frauulent esign to obtain an unfair avantage of his copartners, which woul work a total forfeiture of his rights, can be inferre. He left them in possession of the partnership property, an the avails of his labor in an unfinishe, but not useless state. Unlike the efenant in Harvey vs. Howell, 5 Ark. 270, whose conuct the court then thought a fit subject for animaversion, the complainant here i not engage in any business hostile to the interests of the partnership, or o anything inconsistent with it beyon his capricious abanonment of the unertaking, which i not hiner them from prosecuting it to completion!
The cause will be remane with instructions to the court below to irect an account to be taken of the amount ue to the complainant for his work an services, materials furnishe or money expene about the erection of the am an mill, supposing him to have been employe by the efenants for that purpose, an after eucting therefrom in the way of compensation such amount as he may have receive from the efenants, to ecree that they pay him the resiue, if any, which he will take in lieu of any interest he might have ha in the partnership property, or the profits arising from it.",legal_case,neutral

This was an action of ebt upon a jugment. The plaintiff sue for the use of Freerick H. Cossitt, James M. Howar an Jno. H. Hill, partners, &c., uner the firm of “ Cossitt, Howar & Hill,” thé amount of ebt emane being $112 85. The writ of summons, which issue upon the filing of the eclaration, containe corresponing recitals. At the return term, the efenant appeare an emurre to the eclaration. The emurrer being sustaine, the plaintiff obtaine leave to file an amene eclaration, at the succeeing term, to which the cause was continue. By his amene eclaration, the plaintiff professe to sue for the use of the same persons composing the firm of “Cossitt, Howar & Hill,” except that the name of the latter was state as Ira H. Hill, an the aggregate ebt emane was $113 ■60. For these suppose variances between the writ an the amene eclaration, the efenant was allowe to file a plea in abatement of the writ. The plaintiff excepte to a ecision of the court overruling his motion-to strike out the plea, an he resting upon this exception, the efenant ha jugment.
In any view of the case, the plea ought to have been treate .as frivolous. The efenant being in court upon his emurrer, the writ of summons to bring him there ha fulfille its office. A variance between the writ an cause of action set forth in the eclaration, to which he ha appeare, was no longer available as a efence. Ole vs. Floy & Erwin, 5 Ark. 249. For aught that appears the amenments were proper to be allowe in the iscretion of the court for the furtherance of justice, of clerical misprisions in the first eclaration, an not operating to the surprise or injury of the efenant, who acquiesce in them. The amene eclaration set out the same cause of action as the former one, varying only as to an item of costs ajuge in the original suit. There being a plaintiff on the recor, having the legal title an right to sue, he was uner no obligation to isclose the name of the person for whose use the suit might have been brought. That was a precaution for the benefit of the cestui que trust, or equitable assignee of the claim, whose rights will be protecte by courts of law against any frauulent combination between the nominal plaintiff an the efenant. So, notwithstaning any misescription of the equitable assignee, the efenant might well have pleae an prove a payment to, or release by the real owner of the eman sue for; so that no substantial right of his coul be impaire by any such mistake or omission in the eclaration.
The cause will be remane with instructions to sustain the motion to strike out the plea in abatement, an that the efenant be hear, oí he have any efence to the merits.",legal_case,neutral

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This writ of error was sue out by the plaintiffs in error, to a jugment obtaine against them in the Clark Circuit Court, after execution ha been issue an levie upon their property, an they, together with others, as securities, execute a forthcoming bon, an the same ha been forfeite, an so returne by the sheriff, an the return term ha elapse, as appears by the ates set out. These facts were set up by plea, to which a emurrer was interpose, an the question is thus presente, whether the plaintiffs in error can now maintain their writ of error to the original jugment.
The constitutionality of the forthcoming law act was consiere an etermine in the case of Rearon, Ex parte, 4 Eng. R. 450. Its unconstitutionality was again urge in the case of Ruell vs. McGruer, (6 Eng. R. 584), an the point again rule as in the former case, with the aitional intimation that, after the lapse of the term, to which the forthcoming bon was returnable, the obligors of the bon coul fin relief only in a court of equity. Afterwars, in the case of Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe, et al. 7 Eng. R. 548, it was hel, that after the forfeiture of the bon the levy was ischarge an the former jugment was satisfie. An to the same effect are the cases of Wright vs. Yell, et al. 13 Ark. 505, an Jamison vs. May, i. 608. An in the case of The Trustees of the Real Estate Bank vs. Sanefur, a. et al. ecie uring the present term, where many of the cases ecie in Kentucky, Vix*ginia, Mississippi an the Feeral Court, as well as our own, are reviewe, it is shown that the statutory jugment is consiere as having the qualities, force, effect an ignity of a jugment, obtaine in the orinaiy moe of proceeing accoring to the course of the common law, in a court of competent jurisiction, an as such may be revive by scire facias, an, in another State, is within the act of Congress of 1790, an can no more be impeache collaterally than any other jugment, (Kelly vs. Lambs, 7 B. Monroe, p. 223.) An these cases sustain the ecision of this court in the case of Kelly et al. vs. Garvin, Carson & Co., (7 Eng. R. at p. 621), where it is hel that “the statutory jugment is an extinguishment of the first jugment upon the principle that a party cannot have more than one jugment for the same subject matter at the same time.”
These consequences resulting from the voluntary act of the efenant in the execution executing the forthcoming bon uner the provisions of the statute, it is no more unreasonable that he shoul thereby be cut off from any further remey in a court of law, an be riven to a court of equity exclusively for relief, as against any other jugment at law, than making an injunction operate as a release of errors at law.
We think the matters set up in the plea sufficient, an therefore the writ of error must be quashe.

elivere the opinion of the Court. The plaintiff in error has appeale from the jugment of the court below, ismissing his suit for the want of a sufficient bon for costs. The objections to the bon appear to be, that the ay of the month of its ate is left blank, an that it is given by a firm, signe by their firm name an style uner seal. The suit was commence on the 18th of September, 1851, an the bon for costs has the following enoi’sement, signe by the clerk: “The above bon approve by me, September 18,1851, an file before writ issue.” On the hearing before the court of the issue upon the efenant’s motion to ismiss, the plaintiff prouce the bon an enorsement referre to, an mae part of the recor, an the facts in evience were, that the bon in question ha been file before the commencement of the suit, an approve by the clerk of the court as sufficient: that it ha been signe, seale, an elivere by J. H. Patterson, one of the firm of Byers & Patterson; that he was a resient of this State an responsible for the costs which might accrue in the suit in question; an that the plaintiff was a non-resient;
The statute requires the non-resient plaintiff, about to commence a suit in any circuit court, to file in the office of the clerk, the obligation of some responsible person, being a resient of this State, for the payment of all costs which may accrue in such action'.
The question here is not whether one partner can bin his co-partner, by an instrument uner seal, so as to make the firm liable upon an obligation execute by one in their joint names, nor is there any question as to what authority or assent by the partner not signing will be sufficient to make such an obligation obligatory upon him. The bon was certainly execute by one of the firm, an as hel in Day vs. Lafferty, 4 Ark. 450, it is goo against him. Whenever it is amitte, as ecie in Ferguson vs. The State Bank, 6 Eng. 512, that the plea of non est factum goes onlyto thepersonal ischargeof the party pleaing it; anthatthe party, who execute the ee, continues liable, it follows that the statute in this case has been substantially complie with. Neither the efenant, nor any officer of the court, who may become intereste in the bon for costs, has any right to insist that there shall be more than one security for costs, if he be a solvent an responsible person. The case stans as if there were two securities, an one of them for any cause not liable on the bon or irresponsible.
The ate, though prima facie evience of the time of the execution is not necessary to the valiity of a ee, which takes effect from the time of its elivery.
If the Circuit Court thought the bon to be so informal or efective as likely to embarrass the efenant or the officers of the court, in the recovery upon it of their legal emans that woul accrue in the progress of the suit, it might, accoring to its iscretion, have rule the plaintiff to furnish a bon free from any such objection, as it woul, where there is a oubt of the continuing solvency of the security; but upon the facts state here, the ecision of the court absolutely ismissing the plaintiff’s suit is not, as we conceive, in accorance with strict law, or the reason of the statute.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
In February, 1845, the intestate, Spears, exhibite his bill against Taylor, alleging that in the year 1834, they forme a partnership in a saw mill, an that in the year 1836, they also entere into a mercantile partnership in Jefferson county. That the partnership in the mill was issolve some time in the summer of 1837, an that the mercantile partnership was continue until about the month of January, 1839. That profits were realize from both the concerns, which were woun up by Taylor, who ha charge of the books an receive the avails. The bill praye iscovery an account, an a ecree for the balance ascertaine to be ue to the complainant.
Taylor answere, that there was a partnership in two saw mills, one in a water mill commencing in 1834, an the other in a steam mill. That the steam mill was put into operation about the first of January, 1836, an some time uring the spring of the same year the water mill was washe away. That there was also a partnership in a store, which continue from some time in the year 1836 until August, 1837. That no profits were realize from either business, of which he exhibite accounts. That he ha pai ebts of the concerns beyon what assets he ha receive. That he was always reay an willing to settle, but complainant ha left the State, an it was his own fault that there ha been no settlement. He set up by way of answer the statute of limitations of three years as a bar to the relief.
Subsequently, Taylor file a cross bill re-asserting his answer with an enlarge statement of the business of the several partnerships, an of other transactionsbetween Spears anhimself, claiming a balance ue to him by Spears, on a full settlement, praying an account an ecree. Among the unsettle matters between them, he represente that, as the agent of Spears, who ha left the country, he sol a tract of lan belonging to Spears, an for the procees of which, he ha given him creit on account of what Spears owe him. That Spears, who was insolvent, ha recovere jugment against him on the law sie of the court, for the procees of the lan in question; an he praye that this jugment might be enjoine an brought into the account to be state between them.
Spears answere, amitting the partnerships in the two mills an the store. He again gave his own version of the partnership transactions. He enie that he was insolvent. He insiste that the transaction about the sale of the lan ha no connection with the partnership business. An as to some items charge against him by Taylor, an which he allege were transactions outsie of the partnerships, he relie in his answer on the statute of limitations. He answere, that his action against Taylor to recover the procees of the lan was pening, an no jugment ha then been renere in it.
The two suits being at issue, by replications to the answers, both parties proceee to take epositions! At a subsequent term, the court orere that Spears esist from proceeing to execute the jugment at law, which he ha in the meantime obtaine against Taylor; an the master in chancery was irecte to take an state an account of the matters in ispute between the parties. Aitional epositions were taken before the master, an upon the coming in of his report, it was excepte to by Spears upon various grouns. At a subsequent term the eath of Spears being suggeste, his aministrator was substitute, an the cause was submitte upon the exceptions to the master’s report. The court being of opinion that neither party was entitle to any relief, ismisse the original an cross bill at the costs of the respective complainants, from which ecree both parties appeale.
Such is a brief outline of the voluminous recor of this cause ; the etails of which are not material to the etermination of the question, which we unerstan to be involve in the cause, an the only one upon which we can suppose the ecision of the court below to have turne.
In Tatam vs. Williams, 3 Hare, 347, ecie in 1844, an the latest English case we meet with on this subject, the bill of a surviving partner seeking an account of partnership transactions, brought thirteen years after issolution by eath of one of the partners, was ismisse on the groun of lapse of time. The ¡Yíce Chancellor sai, “ In this court there is irect an very high authority for the proposition that a court of equity will not, after six years acquiescence, unexplaine by circumstances, or countervaile by acknowlegment, ecree an account between a surviving partner, an the estate of a ecease partner,” citing Barber vs. Barber, 18 Vesey 286. Ault vs. Goorich, 4 Russell 430, an Briges vs. Mitchell, Gilbert's Eq. Rep. 224, an those cases were ahere to, notwithstaning the remarks of Lor Brougham an the apparent grouns of the ecision by the House of Lors in the case of Robinson vs. Alexaner, 8 Bligh 352.
It is to be collecte from the case of Ray vs. Bogart, 2 John. Cases 432, that, assuming eleven years as the perio of elay unaccounte for, after issolution of a partnership, a bill seeking an examination an settlement of the accounts will be ismisse where the statute of limitations is not pleae or insiste on in the answer, though Juge Kent, who iffere from a majority of the court of errors, oubte whether the statute of limitations applies where there is a mutual trust as between partners, an if it i, he thought the efence is waive unless insiste on.
The circumstance that the estate of a ecease partner is sought to be charge is one that may often influence a court of chancery in refusing reief, so far as that may epen upon iscretion, because of the suppose inability of the representatives of the ecease partner, to conten on equal terms with the survivor san the statute of the State limiting claims against the estates of ecease persons, unless presente for probate an allowance within two years from the grant of letters, woul no oubt have a material bearing upon cases of that escription, where the statute of limitation has any application in chancery. But the ecisions are not confine to cases where either of the partners ha ecease. Where the statute applies in chancery, the enial of the relief oes not epen on that circumstance. In Diier vs. Davison, 2 Barbour Chy. Rep. 482, this subject was consiere, an upon the strength of the previous ajuge cases in New York, relief was enie on a bill for account, where there ha been no ealings within six years, an the complainant an efenant were in full life. The case there was embarrasse by the exception in the statute of accounts between merchant an merchant. The statute of this State, in force 20th March, 1839, oes not retain this exception, but enacts in lieu of it, that in all cases of mutual ealings, the statute runs from the last item prove; an it seems to be settle in Englan, as well as in this country, that the accounts between partners respecting the profits or transactions of the firm, are not hel to be within the saving in favor of accounts between merchant an merchant, where that exception exists.
In express trusts, where one hols the legal title an another has the beneficial interest, an which, as between the trustee an ■cestui que trust are recognizable only in a court of equity, so long-as the trust create by the ee of the parties or the appointment of law, is recognize to exist, an for any purpose remains to be execute, the statute of limitations, as such, or the analogous bar by lapse of time or staleness of the eman can have no application. But implie trusts often epening on parol proof, which have to be establishe as well as enforce by the ai of a court of equity, an originating in some wrongful an frauulent act of the party sought to be charge as trustee, which is a isavowal oí the relation, o come within the reason an policy of the statute. In such cases the party seeking to establish the trust, is suppose to have some remey, though not an aequate one at law, against the trustee committing the wrongful act or conversion, upon which the law raises the trust by implication; an where the party seeking reress is apprise of his rights, or if they be frauulently conceale from him, whenever the frau is iscovere, or might reasonably have become known, he must assert his rights in equity within the perio limiting the analogous remey at law, unless he come within some saving or exception. Else by merely going into another forum, he coul evae the policy of the statute limiting actions atlaw. Conceing then that there is a quasi trust or confience in the ealings between partners, it is not that kin of technical trust cognizable only in equity, an which exclues the operation of the statute. With equal reason such a claim to exemption from the statute coul be mae in all cases of bailment, agency an the various confiential relations in the transaction of business. Such is recognize to be the law in this country in numerous cases, among which, the leaing one is that of Kane vs. Bloogoo, 7 John. Chy. 89, an the authorities will be foun collecte on the subject in Murray's amr. vs. Mason's amr. 8 Porter 211. See also Baker vs. Bile, Balwin's Rep. 418.
In this case the partnerships were issolve by the abanonment of Spears in 1837. It oes not appear that any settlement was attempte or that either party sought it. No circumstance of accient, frau or concealment is allege, which woul now entitle the parties to the favor of equity. The bills are purely for an account an for iscovery in ai of it. The bulk of the business was transacte ten years before the filing of the bill, an there oes not appear to have been any transaction within eight years. Then recurring to the statute which limits all actions of accounts, assumpsit, or ebt upon contracts not in writing, to three years; actions on promissory notes an contracts in writing not uner seal, to five years; upon writings obligatory an j ugments to ten years; an the statute of non-claim against estates before averte to, the policy which pervaes it is sufficiently inicate; an where the statute applies courts of equity accoring to these rules, as well as courts of law ought to aminister it. The case of McGuire vs. Ramsay, 4 Eng. 518, oes not necessarily conflict with the point actually ecie'here, that the relation between co-partners oes not create such a trust as will exempt a bill for a mere account an settlement, from the operation of the statute, but it maybe oubte whether that case i not go a great way in establishing an implie trust after lapse of time.
For the same reasons that a efenant in chancery is not require in all cases to avail himself of the efence of limitation, by way of answer or by plea, as at law, but may emur where a efence, which the complainant by his allegations has anticipate without avoiing, appears to exist on the face of the bill, the objection that the claim is a stale one may be taken at the hearing, an when the proofs isclose such a case, the court may of its own motion eny relief to parties who have slept upon their rights; because while courts of chancery may have a iscretion to etermine the rights of parties seeking an ajuication, notwithstaning the lapse of time where the facts are not ispute or susceptible of being clearly ascertaine; the reason why they refuse relief in accorance with a statute by which they are not expressly boun, is the fear of oing injustice, an the inability to affor relief, where the sources of testimony have become obscure or lost by lapse of time.
The present case is peculiarly one of that escription. The bar of the statute set up by Taylor in his answer, must be consiere as waive by his cross bill, which eprive Spears of any election to ismiss the bill, an the court was free to settle the controversy between the parties, if the proofs gave assurance that it coul be one with any egree of certainty or safety. But it appears that all the partnerships were mere parol agreements an as to the very terms an stipulations of which at the outset the answers of the parties themselves raically an irreconcilably.- In the two mills an the store, Taylor was in partnership with ifferent persons, an Spears was let in as a sort of sub-partner with Taylor in his half interest in these concerns. No regular books of account were kept, an of such as were kept some are lost. The master i not attempt to take any account of the mercantile transactions. The mill accounts are complicate by the loss of rafts an isputes between the parties concerning receipts for lumber an isbursements for expenses, an for the hire an support of hans; an epening for eluciation upon the uncertain testimony of witnesses, who as they are competent by having no interest in the transactions, ha no motive to unerstan or recollect them with accuracy.
If injustice has been one by turning both parties out of court, it is to be regrette only as the result of their own laches, an for the reason that it cannot be clearly known whether injustice has been one, we conclue that the chancellor in refusing relief to either party, was influence by just views of the law an his uty.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The petitioner represents that he is the plaintiff in a certain action at law, pening in the Pulaski Circuit Court, now in session, the suit being brought upon a promissory note, which ha been assigne to the plaintiff. That the efenant in the Circuit Court, uring its present term, after having oyer of the instrument sue on, emurre for a variance between the escription of the plaintiff’s name as set out in the eclaration an that isclose by the instrument given on oyer. That the only variance consiste in this, that the plaintiff sue as Anre, an the assignment as fille up, an which was one by the plaintiff’s attorney through mere inavertence was Anrew,it being the same Christian name, accoring as it is spelt in French or English. That the court there has sustaine the emurrer for the suppose variance, an thereupon the plaintiff, by leave of the court, has correcte the mistake in the filling up of the assignment, by inserting Anre instea of Anrew, That the efenant making no further efence, the plaintiff move for jugment for want of a plea; but the court there has, on motion of the efenant, an without any showing being mae therefor, orere the cause to be continue until the next term, thereby enying the petitioner his legal right to have jugment for his ebt; wherefore he prays that a manamus issue against the juge of that court commaning him to set asie the orer of continuance an progress with the cause.
It will be concee that a manamus is the only aequate specific remey for a suitor, where the inferior court refuses to exqrcise its jurisiction, an will not procee to ajuicate a cause pening before it, of which it has cognizance, an where no reason appears for such refusal. The manamus will go to compel the court to act, but not to control its juicial iscretion, by irecting it what jugment to give, or to review the correctness of any ecision mae uring the progress of a cause; else the manamus woul become an inirect substitute for the final review by writ of error or appeal. The proceeing by manamus to compel a Circuit Juge, sitting as a chancellor, to grant an injunction as praye upon any given case presente to him by the bill, an which he has refuse, is in the nature of an. appeal allowe by statute, from some interlocutory orer or ecree of the inferior court.
Accoring to the report of Dixon vs. Feil, 5 Eng. 243, mainly relie on by the petitioner here, it was, as we think, an extreme case to warrant the issuance of a manamus. But amitting, upon the authority of the opinion in that case, that a manamus will lie to control the iscretion of the inferior court in the continuance of a cause, where that iscretion is so palpably abuse as to amount to a enial of justice, the case here is ifferent.
The court below ecie the emurrer. If the petitioner was aggrieve by the ecision, his only remey was to rest upon it an suffer final jugment, which coul be reviewe on a writ of error of appeal. He might then require this court to ecie whether the groun of emurrer was frivolous, or the variance so trifling as to he amenable, without occasioning any surprise or pretext for elay to the efenant. The petitioner acquiesce in the ecision upon the emurrer by making the amenment conformable with iff Accoring to the case presente by the petition, it will be impossible to grant the manamus without reviewing the correctness of that ecision. By the 6th rule of practice for the Circuit Courts, aopte by this court at July term 1848, when a emurrer to a eclaration is sustaine, the emurrant is entitle to a continuance of the cause: an while that rule remains in force, the continuance follows of necessity from the ecision of the court sustaining the emurrer, no matter how erroneous in point of law.

Gray, who was a brother-law of the efenant, ha sent him to Nashville, to perfect an complete his eucation, an pai all the expenses an charges attening the same, which were allowe him in the settlement of his accounts, ha cease to be guarian on the 13th of January, 1842, on the war’s reaching the age of twenty-one, an ha turne over to the war his property, the complainant allege, in substance, that he never ha any transactions with, nor i he ever owe Ellison anything iniviually; that in 1840 the efenant wrote one or two letters to the complainant, claiming compensation for the boar of George M. Gray, to the amount of about forty ollars, to which the complainant replie by letter, that he expecte to receive a large sum of money for the use of his war, an if the account was sent uly probate, he woul pay it out of his own funs: that in 1843 Ellison visite Hempstea county, where complainant resie, an saw him on many occasions, but that no claim was prefere or mentione by Ellison, an complainant suppose that it ha been ajuste by Gray, an gave himself no concern about it; that in October, 1845, the complainant visite Nashville, Tennessee, an was there serve with a writ requiring him to answer sai Ellison to a plea of ebt, an in which writ the complainant was escribe to be “Guarian of George M. Gray;” that he consulte an eminent lawyer in Nashville, an truly represente to him all the material facts of the case, who assure the complainant that the action coul not be maintaine nor a recovery ha, without proof that he was still guarian of Gray, an the attorney plege himself to atten to an efen the action; an see that the necessary proof was auce to efeat it, in the event there shoul be no failure of evience on the part of the plaintiff; that knowing that the claim was unfoune an never coul be proven, an relying on his attorney to efeat the suit at the trial, he gave no further attention to it, an hear nothing more from it until 1849, when an action was brought on the jugment, which appeare to have been renere for $174 ebt, an $53 amages an costs; that his attorney, “either by frau an collusion with sai Ellison, or from some unaccountable conuct,” faile to appear an efen the suit as he ha promise to o, an jugment was renere against the complainant by efault, without the intervention of a jury, or the prouction of any evience whatever to establish the eman.
The efenant answere, enying the material allegations’™ the bill, an claime the benefit of the jugment, an also set up in the answer that the efence, if available, shoul have been mae at law, an that a court of equity ha no jurisiction to grant the relief praye for in the bill.
1. The jugment of a court of another State can only be impeache for want of jurisiction over the subject matter or person, or on the groun of frau, an hence it is not competent for the court, where the remey is sought, to inquire into mere irregularities, such as whether jugment was pronounce with or without a jury; or evience was or was not auce, or matters of a like nature; because it must be manifest, that to tolerate such objections, woul be in effect to exercise a revisory power over the jugment in a collateral proceeing, an thus estroy its valiity; The jugment itself closes the oor to such efects, an hence if the impute irregularities an errors in the bill ha been prove, still they coul have no effect whatever in the ecision of this cause, 2 Peters 162. 10 Peters 468, 475. 2 McLean 59.
There is but one allegation which approaches towars laying a founation for relief, an that is a general one, insinuating frau an collusion between the attorney an Ellison, to obtain the jugment. It is not a irect charge of frau, since it was mae alternatively, an couple with an allegation of “unaccountable conuct” in the attorney, the meaning of which is not efine, nor are we informe of what precise acts it consiste, or by what stanar to be measure.
As frau is never to be presume, it follows that, where it is relie as a groun of relief, the facts an circumstances constituting the frau, must be state in the bill with istinctness an precision, so that an issue will be forme which may apprize both parties of proof proper to be taken. Kenney vs. Kenney, 2 Ala. 571. Penerton vs. Galloway, 9 Ham. 178. Pleaings in equity an at law are esigne to apprize parties an the court of the material facts on which the asserte right epens, an to invoke attention to the points to which testimony shoul be irecte, Crockett vs. Lee, 7 Wheat. 527. Necessity imposes it as a uty, an justice requires that the ecree in all cases shoul conform to the allegations an proofs, an inee, the relaxation of these rules to any great extent woul be prouctive of confusion, uncertainty an injustice. This octrine was in effect recognize in Blakeney vs. Ferguson, 3 Eng. 276, an is not only entirely conformable to reason, but amply supporte by the best authorities. James vs. McKennon, 6 John. 559, 564. Cresset vs. Milton, 1 Ves.jr. 449. 3 Wen. 653.
Whatever is essential to the rights of the complainant an within his knowlege ought to be allege with such egree of certainty, as to give the efenant full information of the case he is calle on to answer; or on his failure to appear an efen, that the court may ecree on the face of the bill in favor of the Complainant, 1 Daniell’s Ch. Pr. 411, 421. Story Eq. Pl. 28. The same precision of statement is neither require or attainable in equity as in pleaings at law, but the meaning of the rule is, that the substantial grouns of relief must be state with such general certainty an precision, as to apprize the efenant of the tz’ue zzature of the case, an the points to which testiznony shoul be applie; an justice emans that in all cases, the rule shoul be observe. It is plain that the allegation in the bill lacks the requisite certainty in the matter of the frau, but even if it was sufficient, no proof whatever was taken or ofiere, either express or circumstantial, to sustain it; nor was it even prove that counsel ha been l’etaine at all. There can be no imputation more sezious or grievous against an attorney than that by frau or collusion with his aversaiy, he suffere azi unjust jugment to be obtaine against his client, an it shoul not only be istinctly charge an cleai'ly pi-ove, but one so regarless of the uties an forgetful of the obligations of a high an honorable profession shoul be promptly stricken from its rolls.
If the complainant was zzot inebte to the efenazzt, it was a strictly legal efezzce, an shoul have been mae in the suit at law in Tennessee. Dewees vs. Richarson, 1 A. K. Marsh. 313. He was boun to make it at law, an coul have no relief in equity unless he shows that he was prevente from oing so, by accient, surprise or mistake, or by the frau of the opposite party, without his own fault or negligence. Anrews vs. Fenter, 1 Ark. 186. Hempstea vs. Watkins, 1 Eng. 356. Lansing vs. Ey, 1 Johns. Ch. R. 51. Duncan vs. Lyon, 3 Johns. Ch. R. 351. Foster vs. Woo, 6 Johns. Ch. R. 89. This rule has. been too often recognize an enforce in this court to nee further emonstration. It is true that where courts of law an equity have concurrent jurisiction, a party may make his election as to the tribunal in which he will bring forwar his efence. If he prefers submitting it to a court of chancery, he must neither make nor attempt a efence at law; because the tribunal to which he first submits himself, must of necessity etermine the matter conclusively between the parties. Bently vs. Dillar, 1 Eng 84 Hempstea vs. Watkins, 1 Eng. 356. An this octiine waB re* affirme in Arrington vs. Washington, ecie at July term 1853, by this court, an in which case it was hel that the inquiry in such cases was, not what kin of efence was mae, but whether a efence atlaw was attempte at all, an if so he was preclue from coming into chancery. The rule oes not apply, where the efence offere is of an equitable nature, an coul notbe mae at law, because in that case there is but one tribunal competent to affor relief. Hawkins vs. Depreist, 4 Munf. 469. Sauners vs. Marshall, 4 Hen. & Munf. 459. Spencer vs. Wilson, 4 Munf. 130. Fish vs. Lane, 2 Hayw. 342.
An it is quite immaterial whether the party efens at law or not; for in either event, he is not barre from asserting his right in equity, as to his eqitable efence, by which expression is intene a efence not available at law in any contingency whatever. But the efence set forth in the bill was not of that character. It was purely legal, unaccompanie by equitable circumstances, an no sufficient excuse has been state to show why it was not mae in the suit in Tennessee. The complainant was not ignorant of the facts on which the efence reste, for he avers that he communicate them fully to his counsel, an was informe by the latter that the action coul notbe maintaine, an he chose to rest easy on that avice. No accient is pretene to have prevente it, an frau an collusion are istinctly enie an not prove. The claim for relief is narrowe own to the common case of a person, who having a strict legal efence, neglects to make it at law, an thus forever loses its benefit. Even if a retainer ha been prove an gross' negligence in the counsel, unaccompanie by frau, or unfairness, still to attempt to relieve from its consequences woul be to venture into a vast ocean of litigation without chart or compass to guie us. It woul, in fact, amount to an extension of privileges to one class of persons, which are enie to others, thus estroying that equality which is the boast of a court of equity, an shoul never be lost sight of in its ecisions an ecrees.
The injure party, however, is not without reress; since the attorney is responsible in a civil action for amages, arising from negligence an inattention to the interests of the client. Denton vs. Noyes, 7 Johns. 297.
It was sai correctly an pertinently, in Barrow vs. Jones, 1 J. J. Marsh. 470, that “ courts cannot give reress against the other party tQ the suit, but it? must be sought in a new action. An in Lawson vs. Bettison, 7 Eng. 417, this court hel that where a party employe an attorney at law, either to prosecute or efen his suit in the courts of the country, he presents him to the opposite party an to the worl as his accreite agent, an as such he must be conclue by his acts or omissions where no frau or unfairness is mae to appear. The bill, taking every statement on that subject to be true, fails to show ue iligence on the part of the complainant; but, on the contrary, evinces that he gave himself no concern about the suit, an never attempte to furnish evience, if any existe, to prevent a recovery, an certainly that was not the uty of the attorney. It is a carinal rule in equity, commene by its goo sense, that no man can be relieve from the consequence of negligence, carelessness or inattention; because to o that woul be to make litigation enless, rob the vigilant of their avantages, an overwhelm courts of equity by the pressing multitue of slothful suitors. In their organization courts of equity are properly an necessarily veste with a large iscretion, but still it is a iscretion epening on establishe ari well efine principles, an in every view of the subject, it is clear that the complainant was not entitle to the relief praye for in his bill, an the same shoul have been ismisse.
Unless in ai of a suit at law, no injunction shoul be grante where the applicant for it oes not submit to a jugment at law, or as it is technically terme — confesses jugment. Matthews vs. Douglass, Cooke 136. Nelson vs Owen, 3 Ireell Ch R. 178. The reason is, that if he oes not succee in equity, he might still go on an efen at law, prosecute a writ of error, or take an appeal an thus unreasonably elay his aversary in the obtainment of his rights. 1 Ma. Ch. 132, 1 Vernon 120. No person can be allowe to litigate at law an in chancery at the same time, as to the same subject matter, an an election to resort to the latter forum, lias the effect of closing the oor of the former to him, so far that if he fails his aversary may, without further litigation, avail himself of his recovery at law by means of an execution.
When an action has been commence, Lor Roslyn sai a plaintiff must be permitte to go on to trial an jugment, an that the injunction only staye execution. Franco vs. Franco, 2 Cox 420. Een lays own this rule, that “the plaintiff may procee so far as to be able to take out execution the instant that the injunction is issolve.” Een on Injunctions 97. Therefore after an interlocutory jugment, as by efault or a emurrer, the plaintiff at law may go on to ascertain his amages, 3 P. Wms. 147. Daniell aopting the language of Een, says that after the commencement of a suit at law, the plaintiff may procee so far that he may be in a situation immeiately on the issolution of the injunction, to take out execution. 3 Daniell's Ch. Pr. 1819. In Warwick vs. Norvale, 1 Leigh 96, it was expressly ecie that an injunction can only be grante on conition that the efenant confesses jugment at law, an if a party refuses to submit to such jugment, the injunction will be enie, or if one has been grante it may for such cause be issolve. An this is not a rule of practice to be change or moifie at pleasure, or to be enforce or not, as the chancellor shall think fit ¿ but it is one resting on ancient an well efine principles of justice an equity, an having in view the suppression of litigation an the preservation of the just rights of the averse party. Ham vs. Schuyler, 2 Johns. Ch. R. 140.
As far as the recor inicates in this case, the proceeings at law seem to have been arreste at the commencement, an no jugment to have been confesse at law, an if that is the fact the efenant is now entitle to jugment for his eman. If jugment was renere he is entitle to execute it without further elay.
The ecree must be reverse an the cause remane with irections to issolve the injuction with amages accoring to the statute, that the efenant be allowe to procee at law, an the bill be ismisse at the costs of the complainant.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
Bogy an Bonne, two of the efenants here, have pleae in bar of the w'rit of error, that at the May term, 1851, of the Jefferson Circuit Court, at which the jugment brought up by this writ for revision, was renere, the now plaintiff in error praye an appeal from the same jugment, which appeal was uly prosecute, an upon the filing of the transcript, the appeal was ockete; the appellant assigne errors, an these efenants joine therein, an such further proceeings were ha, that the appeal came on to be hear an was submitte to this court for its final ecision an ajuication therein. The plaintiff emurs because the plea fails to show that the appeal is still pening an unetermine, or that it has been prosecute to final jugment in this^ court.
The ecision at July term, 1853, granting the motion of the appellant in the cause referre to by the plea, for leave to is- . miss the appeal after submission, seems to be also ecisive of the question here presente. We are content to say that the right of an appellant to ismiss, at his own costs, an appeal in a common law case, an sue out a writ of error to the same jugment, oes not epen upon the enquiry, whether the appeal was actually pening in.this court, or whether being so pening it ha been prosecute own to submission. We take the istinction to be between those cases where the appeal oes not operate as a superseeas, an those, on the other han, where by operation of law or the act of the suitor, by entering into recognizance, the execution is staye upon the granting of the appeal to this courti If the successful party in the court below, is not hinere by the appeal from having execution, no goo reason is perceive why* the appellant may not ismiss his appeal, at any time before the final ajuication of it, with like effect, as if he ha brought the cause here for revision by writ of error, without superseeas. As the plea fails to show that by the original appeal, the execution of the jugment became suspene, it is not sufficient to bar the present writ of error. The penency of the appeal at the time of suing out the writ of error, might be goo in abatement of the latter proceeing, but woul not be appropriately mae in bar.
In Clay vs. Notrebe, 6 Eng. 631, this court went so far as to refuse to abate a writ of error, upon a plea that an appeal ha been taken in the court below with stay of execution in the same cause. Though the ecision there turne upon the issue mae by the pleaings, whether the appeal ha been in fact pening in this court, the juge elivering this opinion is constraine to think it was an immaterial issue; because where there has been a superseeas, the option of the appellant to abanon his appeal an bring error, is inconsistent with the right of the appellee, uner the statute, to have an affirmance of the jugment, unless the appeal is iligently prosecute; besies, upon appeals taken in the Circuit Court, the stay of execution oes not epen upon the opinion of any court or juge, who, in his iscretion, may think there is probable groun of error, but the suspension is eman-able at the pleasure of the appellant, upon the sole conition of his ability to furnish satisfactory security. But waiving any such consieration it is certainly a much stronger case than the present one.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The action was ebt, upon jugment renere in another State. The allegation in the eclaration, setting out the jugment, is that the plaintiff, on &c., at a superior court, hel in the county of Talbot, in the State of Georgia, to wit, &c., by the consiera] tion an jugment of sai court, recovere against the efen' ant the sum of one hunre an twenty ollars, for her ebt, as also the further sum of twenty-one ollars an thirty-three cents for her amages, which she ha sustaine by reason of the etention of sai ebt, together with the further sum of ten ollars an fifty cents for her costs in an about sai suit in that behalf expene, whereof the efenant was convict prout patet per recorura, fyc,. The transcript prouce to the court below, upon the issue to the plea of nul tiel recor, shows that, in an action of assumpsit, before the superior court of Talbot county, Georgia, the efenant confesse jugment to the plaintiff for the sum of one hunre an twenty ollars, principal, with interest an costs of suit, an the plaintiff’s attorney signe jugment as follows: “Whereupon, it is consiere by the court that the plaintiff o recover of the efenant the sum of one hunre an twenty ollars, for its principal ebt, an the further sum of twenty-one ollars an thirty-three cents, for its interest, an the further sum of ten ollars an fifty cents, for costs of suit in this behalf expene,” &c. In the authentication of the jugment, the juge, who certifies to the attestation of the clerk, styles himself thus: “I, Alfre Iverson, Juge of the Superior Courts of the Chatahoochee circuit, in sai State, in which circuit is sai county of Talbot,” ec. The court below rejecte the transcript offere in evience, an gave jugment for the efenant.
We think there is no substantial variance between the jugment escribe in the eclaration an that isclose in the transcript. The original recovery, though informal, is, in effect, the same as that escribe by the pleaer in this suit. It is true the cases cite for the plaintiff, among which are, The State Bank vs. Gray, 7 Eng. 760. State Bank vs. Magness, 6 ib. 343, an The State Bank vs. Sherrill, ib. 334, cannot be sai to apply, because in those cases, the recital of the recor was only inucement to the main fact intene to be establishe by it, that is, the institution of a former suit upon the same cause of action, to rebut the presumption arising from lapse of time; an the case of Aams vs. The State for the use of Wallace, at July term, 1853, was ecie upon a like reason. But here the jugment sue upon is necessarily the founation of the action, an it must be concee that a misescription of it, in any material matter, woul be a fatal variance. Yet in such cases the pleaer is not require to escribe the recovery in haec verba, or accoring to its-tenor; but may set it out accoring to its legal effect. The rate of interest allowe by law, is the measure of amages for the breach of a contract to pay money, an whether the action be in form, assumpsit or ebt, the amages, in the shape of interest, follow as a legal consequence upon the ascertainment of the ebt. The jugment is correctly escribe, as to the parties, the' court by whom renere, its ates an amounts, an the eclaration woul therefore seem to be a compliance with the reason-for the rule of pleaing, that a contract must be accurately escribe in orer to ientify the cause of action, for the protection’ of the efenant an as a security against further litigation.
The cause of the rejection, not necessarily appearing, it may be possible that the Circuit Court exclue the transcript offere-in evience, upon the groun that it was not sufficiently authenticate; an so this court might have to hol, were it not for the ecision in Butler vs. Owen, 2 Eng. 369, that where a juge in his attestation, is escribe as juge of the court, it is a sufficient authentication uner the act of Congress, without saying.that he-is the juge, or sole juge; an we are not incline to epart from the preceent there establishe in any ease, where, as in the present instance, there is nothing on the face of the recor auce, from which it coul be inferre that the court was compose of more than one juge or-magistrate.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This is an action of trover from the Hempstea Circuit Court, institute by Pryor against Ryburn, for a negro woman an her two chilren. There was verict, an jugment for the plaintiff, motion for new trial, which was overrule an Ryburn appeale to this court.
For the purpose of establishing his claim to the negroes, Pryor prove in the court below, that in the year 1826, he was marrie to Martha Ann Ryburn, the sister of the efenant an the aughter of Matthew Ryburn, in the State of Tennessee; an that Matthew Ryburn gave the negro woman to Pryor after the marriage: an that some time afterwars, when the negro was about to be sol for Pryor’s ebts, Matthew Ryburn expressly refuse to forbi the sale, saying that he ha given the negro to his aughter,. Mrs. Pryor; an that Pryor hel continue possession of her until 1835 or 1836, with the exception of a year or two about 1830, when Pryor’s father hel the negro in possession. In the fall of 1836, Matthew Ryburn remove from Tennessee to Texas, an on his way receive the negro woman from Pryor an took her to Texas with him, Pryor furnishing her with a horse to rie. On the roa to Texas Matthew Ryburn calle her Pryor’s negro. She was hire for the year 1837, as Pryor’s negro, with the rest of his negroes. In the year 1838, Pryor an his father-in-law mae a crop together, an the negro woman was put in as Pry- or’s property with his other negroes, an Pryor receive one-thir of the crop. They continue thus to live an crop together till about February, 1843, when Matthew Ryburn, having move away, sent his son, Montgomery Ryburn, who came with a gun an took the negro woman forcibly from Pryor. After this, Matthew Ryburn kept the negro in possession till the 1st January,. 1844, when he execute a bill of sale for her an her chil Maria, to the efenant, for $750, an elivere them to him Since 1826 the negro woman has ha three chilren, now in possession of the efenant. Pryor also introuce a witness to prove that in 1837 or 1838, Matthew Ryburn eclare more than once that the negro woman was the property of Pryor or Pryor’s wife. The competency of the evience of this witness was objecte to by Ryburn, but overrule by the court an the evience permitte to go to the jury.
Another witness state in his epositions: “That E. L. Pryor continue to hol sai negro as his property, till the year 1830, when I as constable levie an attachment on her as E. L. Pry or’s property in favor of Sami. Pryor as will more fully appear by the transcript from the Comity Court of Montgomery county, Tennessee, hereto annexe,, marke A., which is mae part of this eposition. My recollection is that at the sale of the negro above name uner sai attachment, Sami. Pryor, the father of plaintiff, purchase the sai negro girl. He took her into possession an retaine possession for some time, an sent the negro to E. L. Pryor, who ha remove to the Western District of Tennessee. I think this was in 1831 or 1832,1 am not certain which.”
“Attache to this eposition was what purporte to be a transcript containing, First: A copy of a writ of attachment, issue out of an returnable to “the County Court of Pleas an Quarter Sessions,” of Montgomery county, Tennesse, ate 20th January, 1830, commaning E. L. Pryor to be attache to answer the complaint of Sami. Pryor; Secon: Copy of affiavit of inebteness-by Sami.. Pryor, sworn to the same ay before Charles Barby, a justice of the peace, who issue an signe the writ: Thir, Attachment bon of Sami. Pryor an surety; Fourth: Return on the writ; showing levy, after levy of other attachments in favor of Hynes & Slaughter, upon many articles of personal property, Pryor’s interest in 80 acres of lan, “one negro girl, Julia,” an “one negro boy, Armstea.” Levy enorse as mae 20th Jan uary, 1830. Fifth. Jugment in favor of Sami, Pryor vs. E. L. Pryor, for $1,427 50, an a memoranum that execution issue to the sheriff of Montgomery county, on the 5th of August, 1830, but ha not been returne.”
Ryburn then offere to prove by a witness that his father, Matthew Ryburn, ha frequently on various occasions eclare in. 1842 an 1843, that he ha merely loane the negro woman to. Pryor, an that Pryor ha often re-elivere her an acknowlege the loan. The testimony was objecte to an rejecte by the court.
Pryor objecte to all testimony as to the statements of Matthew Ryburn since 1826, offere to show that he ha only loane the negro to Pryor..
The following instructions to the jury were aske by Pryor an given by the court, an excepte to by Ryburn:
1st. That the measure of amages was the value of the property at the time of conversion, an interest thereon at six per cent.
2. That taking a bill, of sale for the negro, assuming an claiming ownership, acting as owner an enying Pryor’s claim, constitute a conversion; an no eman was necessary.
3. That a bill of sale is not necessary to pass the title to negroes, but they may as weU pass by elivery; an a. gift accompanie by actual eliveryjm subsequent peaceable possession can no more be revoke i^R a sale.
4th. That as to the valujpf the woman an chil, the efenant not having prouce tfin, an shown them not to be of the best quality, the jury mayTairly presume the strongest against him, an make the highest value proven the measure of amages.”
Among other instructions aske by Ryburn an given by the court, the three following were objecte to by Pryor an exclue by the court, to which Ryburn excepte:
1st. “That if the jury-^Éfelieve from the evience that Matthew Ryburn hel an retaine possession of the negro slaves sue for, as his own property an claime them as such, the jury are boun to fin for the efenant, unless there was some instrument of writing uly recore, showing that the title was not in sai Matthew Ryburn.”
2. “That if the jury believe from the evience that the negroes in controversy, before the allege sale, were merely loane by Matthew Ryburn to Pryor, temporarily, with the right to reclaim them at any time, no sale uner execution or otherwise, or process against Pryor, woul alter, take away, or estroy the rights of Ryburn, unless he (Ryburn), so conceale such loan as to enable Pryor, by using the property as his own for a length of time, to acquire creit on the strength of that possession of the property. But if there was no such concealment on the part of Ryburn, either actual or constructive, he might reclaim the property after such sale, to the same extent as before, whether the property remaine in the hans of the purchaser at such sale, or in the hans of a subsequent purchaser.”
3. “That the sale in Tennessee, if any such sale an subsequent gift took place, (an the jury are to etermine from the evience whether any such sale or gift took place) in no respect change the attitue of Ryburn an Pryor, in regar to the property.”
Ryburn file his motion for new trial on the groun,
1st. The amission of irrelevant an incompetent evience for plaintiff; 2, The exclusion of projK- an competent evience offere by the efenant. 3, Giv jBPimproper instructions for the plaintiff. 4th, Refusing instrucW aske by the efenant! 5th, Verict contrary to instructioiw 6th, Verict contrary to law an evience. 7th, Verict ex(0t ve an unwarrante by proof. This motion the court over'. s <■., an Ryburn took his bill of exceptions.
It appears from the bill of exception hat Ryburn file á plea of the statute of limitations of three years, in bar of the action, which, on motion of the plaintiff was stricken from the files, to which the efenant excepte. ife-
ist. The court below, in striking from the files the efenant’s plea of the statute of limitations of three years, committe no error. We think it clear the perio of three years oes not apply to an action of trover. This case oes not come within section 6, of the Revise Statutes, in relation to limitations. “Trover is not an action ior taking or injuring goos or chattels. It goes on the groun of a fining an conversion.” The efenant having file his plea of five years in bar, the plea applicable to this case, the court ecie correctly, in striking the other plea of three years from the files.
2. It appears that uring the trial, the plaintiff, to prove the gift of the negro, offere the eclarations of the onor mae subpequent to the allege gift, but before the onor parte with his interest to the efenant. The efenant, in orer to rebut this, an to show that the negrb was merely loane an not given, offere the eclarations of the onor mae uring the same time. The court below receive as evience the eclarations of the onor in favor of the plaintiff an rejecte his eclarations offere in behalf of the efenant. The principle is well establishe, by repeate ajuications, that although a man’s eclarations are not evience for him, they are evience against him, anhis subsequent venee must abie those eclarations. If the plaintiff ha relie alone on the evience of the gift an elivery of the negro, without resorting on his part to the subsequent eclarations of the onor, although competent for him to o so, the eclarations of the onor offere by the efenant against the plaintiff ought to have been rejecte. But as the plaintiff thought proper to resort to the eclarations of the onor to ascertain his intention, that testimony like every other ought to be given entire. We therefore think the court erre in excluing the eclarations of the onor offere by the efenant in this case. But in as much as the court i permit the efenant to prove by John W. Ryburn an Montgomery Ryburn, the subsequent eclarations of the onor against the plaintiff, in substance the same as that rejecte, we think the case shoul not be reverse for this error. Sims vs. Saners, 1 Harp. R. 374. 1 Bailey’s R. 113, 116.
3. Although the copy of a writ of attachment, the affiavit, attachment bon, the return on the writ showing the levy an jugment, mae an exhibit in the eposition of Jenkins, are no evience of the legality of the proceeings therein containe, or of the valiity of the subsequent sale of the negro uner them^ yet as facts or circumstances connecte with the acts an eclarations of the onor an in relation to which they took place, we think was goo evience to prove the negro was given an not loane, an for this purpose it was competent.
4th. The four instructions aske an given on the part of the plaintiff, we consier substantially the law. The only oubt that can reasonably arise is as to the 4th instruction, the substance of which is, “that the jury might make the highest value proven the measure of amages.” This we take to be the law.
5th. The first instruction aske an exclue on the part of the efenant is clearly erroneous. An instrument in writing' has never been hel necessary to pass the title to negroes.
6th. The secon instruction aske an exclue on the part of the efenant was also erroneous. For the reason that the title of the lener might be iveste in more ways than the “person in possession obtaining creit on the strength of the property,” as for instance, staning by an encouraging the sale of his pro* perty. The court, therefore, correctly exclue it.
7th. The 3 instruction aske an exclue on the part of the efenant was likewise erroneous. For the reason that the sale, taken in connection with the amissions an acts of the onor, was evience of the fact that the negro ha been given an not loane. Otherwise the sale an all the proceeings connecte therewith woul have been irrelevant an shoul have been exclue. The instruction, therefore, was not applicable, an therefore properly exclue-
The only remaining question to be consiere is as to the amount of amages given by the jury.
One witness testifie that he knew the negro woman in 1841 1842- — -thinks she ha one chil, an they were worth about $800, Another witness testifie that he owne negroes an knew the value of them; an that the negro woman an her chil in 1844, were worth $1300. Another testifie that in 1844 the negro wor snqn was worth $650, or $700, an her chil $300. Montgomery Ryburn testifie that at the time of the trial the negro woman an her three chilren were worth about $1250.
The jury, at the May term, 1852, renere a verict for $1875. Upon this evience we think the verict of the jury might wel} be sustaine.

This w'as an action of assumpsit upon open account, to which the efenant pleae non-assumpsit an set-off. The bills of particulars on either sie consiste of various items, which were sought to be establishe by proof. No objection was mae to the introuction of evience, an the cause was submitte without instructions to the jury, who foun a balance of account in favor of the plaintiff below. The efenant move for a new trial, because the verict was contrary to evience, an upon the groun of newly iscovere testimony. The motion being overrule, he excepte to the ecision of the court an took a bill of exceptions, setting out the evience. From this it oes appear that the efenant auce testimony conucing to prove a a larger amount of off-set than was allowe him by the verict of the jury. But the istinction is to be taken between cases where this court will venture to set asie a verict, because it is without evience as to some material fact necessary to uphol it, an cases like the present, where the verict is objecte to merely because it is against evience. The principal item of his account, which the efenant here attempte to prove, an which the jury woul seem to have rejecte, was for a quantity of corn, which the plaintiff ha taken an sol from the plantation of the efenant. But it is inferable from the testimony, though conveye to this court through the unsatisfactory meium of a bill of exceptions, that this was corn which the plaintiff himself, ha raise upon a plantation of the efenant, an therefore, might have ha a right to ispose of as his own. The presumption is to be inulge that if the verict was grossly unjust to either party, because against the weight of evience, the juge who presie at the trial, woul not have refuse to exercise his iscretion to set it asie. But surely upon the verict an the concurring refusal of the court below to isturb it, every possible presumption ought to be ha in favor of its correctness. Else this court woul be assuming the power it has not, to ictate to juries that they must believe evience against their own convictions of its truth.
The efenant, in his affiavit, state that he ha iscovere, since the trial, that he coul prove by an absent witness, the payment of a certain sum of money to the plaintiff, not long before the commencement of the suit. The witness was then resiing in the county. Besies the want of iligence inicate by the tenor of the affiavit, there are various objections to its sufficiency. No such item is charge in the efenant’s bill of particulars, as that to which the newly iscovere testimony woul apply. If the efenant ha, in fact, mae such payment, it is reasonable to suppose he woul charge it in his account, among other items of cash an merchanize. But the affiavit oes not aver that any such payment was mae except by inference, because he was informe an believe he coul prove it by the witness referre to. If the efenant were inicte on this cautious affiavit for swearing falsely, that he ha mae such payment, it is oubtful whether he coul be convicte.

This is an application for an appeal uner the provisions of our statute, (Dig. ch. 28, p. 244, an 135), an the question presente, is whether or not, uner the provision of the 21st section of our statute of ower; (Dig. ch. 59, p. 448), when the husban ies, leaving a wiow an no chilren, she takes one-half of the real estate, an one-half of the slaves of which he ie seize, absolutely an in her own right, or only a ower estate in them, for the fall term of her natural life; an vve think it perfectly clear, when this section is consiere in connexion with the other provisions of the ower law, that she takes only a ower interest an estate for life.
It is manifest that if she takes the slaves, absolutely an in her own right, she takes the real estate in the same way, an this woul be in conflict with the policy of our statute of escents, of preserving the inheritance in the bloo of the first purchaser, subject to ower in the common law sense of that term; as to the uration of the estate. It is only when there are no kinre, either paternal or maternal, capable of inheriting, an next before it escheats, that real estate escens from the husban to the wife, or vice versa, (Dig. ch. 56, sec. 7). It woul be easy to show, by enlarging upon this view of the subject, that if the wiow coul take one-half of the lan absolutely, an not a oWer -estate in it for life only, the Legislature ha really achieve much less than half they eviently esigne by the system of escents fthey set on foot.

On the secon ay of June,-1847, the plaintiff file in the office of a justice of the peace, the following instrument:-
“White county, March 3, 1842.
Twelve months after ate, we promise jointly an severally to pay to Abner Bailey, aministrator of Elijah Bailey, ecease, or orer, forty-five ollars an twelve an a half cents, for value receive, with interest at ten per cent, per annum, after maturity. Witness our hans an seals.
JOHN L. GATTON, [l.s.] ‘
JOHN M. CLARK, [l.s.]
AUGUSTUS GATTON, [l.s.]”
Upon which instrument so file the justice issue a summons requiring the efenants to appear before him to answer the complaint of Abner Bailey, aministrator of the estate of Elijah Bailey, ecease, on a note of han.
The case was brought by appeal from the justice’s court, to the Circuit Court, an upon the trial e novo, the efenant, Gatton, pleae, ne ungues aministrator, to which issue was taken, an the case was submitte to a jury for trial; when upon motion of the efenant, the writing obligatory was exclue as evience from the jury, because of an allege variance between the instrument offere, an that escribe in the summons, an to which the efenant was calle upon to efen. The court sustaine the motion to exclue the writing obligatory from the jury as evience, an thereupon a jugment was renere for the efenant, from which the plaintiff has appeale to this court.
The plea of ne ungues aministrator tenere an immaterial issue, because the writing obligatory was execute to the plaintiff, an the suit brought upon it was in his own name iniviually, an not as aministrator. The wors “aministrator, &c.,” were wors of personal escription, an the plaintiff might well elect to treat them as such, or .he might, at his election, have consiere the writing obligatory as assets, an have sue upon it as aministrator, as hel in Hemphill vs. Hamilton, 6 Eng. 428.
As regars the allege variance that the instrument escribe in the summons an which the efenant was calle to answer, was a note of han, an that offere in evience was a writing obligatory, it may be well to review our former ecisions; some of which woul seem to sustain the objection taken.
In the case of Jeffry vs. Unerwoo, 1 Ark. Rep. 108, the same state of facts presente here, came up for consieration. The efenant was summone to answer the complaint of the plaintiff upon a note of han, an the instrument offere in evience was a seale instrument. The court hel the variance fatal. It may be well to inquire whether, amitting this ecision to be correct, (an we will not question its correctness uner the statute then in force,) the change in our statute, since that ecision oes not materially affect the ecision.
Prior to the passage of our present statute, which took effect 20th March, 1839, it was not necessary to file the cause of complaint upon which the suit was brought, until the commencement of the trial! The efenant ha no other information in regar to the nature of the eman which he was summone to answer, than that isclose in the summons! The form of the summons is given, an uner it the instrument is to be set out. See sec. 41 Steel & McCamp. Dig. p. 365.
In this respect, our statute, as it existe when the present suit was commence, an as it now exists, is materially ifferent. Section 25 Dig., ch. 95 provies that “ wherever any suit shall be foune on any instrument of writing, pui-porting to have been execute by the efenant, such instrument shall be file with the justice, before any process shall be issue in the suit.” An in sec. 32, which gives the form of a summons, the escription of the eman, upon which the recovery is sought, is omitte. The Legislature, in making this change eviently intene, by require ing the instrument, upon which the suit was to be brought, to be file before the summons issue, to make it accessible to the efenant, an to furnish him with the necessary information, to enable him to efen against it.
The efenant no longer looks uner our present statute, to the summons for such information; an shoul it be unnecessarily inserte, it may be consiere as surplusage. The instrument file is the true evience of the nature of the complaint. It is in effect a eclaration, upon which the action rests, an is also, in some instances, the evience of the eman. We have no later ecisions that come fully up to the precise question now uner consieration. So far as they go, however, they may be sai to sustain the views which we have expresse. In Levy vs. Sherman, 1 Eng. 184, suit was brought on a bank note of the Bank of Missouri. The main question was, whether any cause of action was file; that is, whether a bank note, not enorse, was evience of inebteness from the plaintiff to the efenant. The coui't, in consiering that question, remarke upon this statute, to the effect that a escription of the instrument sue on, was unnecessary in the summons, as says the court, “it coul at all times be examine an inspecte by the parties. The plaintiff is require to put his cause of action on file, in orer that the averse party may know what he is calle upon to answer.”
In Patterson vs. Wilson, 1 Eng. 476, the summons was silent as to the cause of complaint. The justice escribe the instrument sue upon as a note, when, in fact, that file was a bon. The court hel, (an no oubt, correctly,) that the writing obligatory was competent evience.
In Anthony Ex parte, 5 Ark. 359, the suit was commence upon a change ticket, which, however, was not file. It is true that the summons require'the efenant to appear an answer in an action of account. But that was not the important enquiry. It was that no cause of action was file, an that if file it was such as the court coul not procee to try, as hel in Reeves vs. Clark.
We have taken occasion to make this brief review of the former ecisions of the court to show that the case of Jeffry vs. Unerwoo, is not authority uner, our present statute, an that our other ecisions favor the conclusions which we have announce; that, as the statute requires the instrument on which the suit is foune, to be file before the summons issues an ispenses with any escription of it in the summons, that the party efenant .shoul look to the instrument on file, an not to the summons for the cause of action against him. An consequently that a variance between the instrument on file, an that escribe in the summons will not avail the efenant on the trial. This construction is, in our opinion, in conformity with the spirit an intention of the statute, an will ten to remove a mere technical objection to a proceeing in a court where the most liberal construction shoul be inulge in favor of the regularity of its proceeings. The Circuit Court therefore erre in excluing the writing obligatory as evience from the jury.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The appellant sue the appellee as enorser of a promissory note past ue. The enorsement was mae on the 1st of February, 1851. All the parties, maker, payee, an enorsee, resie at Little Rock, but at the ate of the enorsement the maker was temporarily absent in Kentucky, from whence he returne home some time between the 10th au 25th of the same month. Conceing every fact in favor of the enorsee, which the evience conuce to prove, it woul appear that on the 26th of February he presente the note to the maker an emane payment of it, which was refuse, of which, on the same ay he notifie the enorser in person, an that he looke to him for payment. The two in company then calle upon the maker, who mae a partial payment on the note to the enorsee, who now seeks to recover of the enorser the resiue remaining unpai.
Various points are argue upon the instructions given an refuse in the court below, only one of which is material to be consiere, as upon that, the jugment in favor of the enorser will have to be affirme.
Accoring to the existing law of this State, the enorsee or assignee of this note ha choice of two courses to pursue. If he esigne to charge the enorser, as of commercial paper, accoring to the law merchant, he was boun to make presentment an eman of payment from the maker, an give notice of non-payment to the enorser, accoring to the rules of the law merchant. Or neglecting that course, he might, after prosecuting with ue iligence a fruitless suit against the maker, have ha recourse against his assignor, accoring to the law concerning assignments, as heretofore unerstoo an practice in this State.
In Jones vs. Robinson, 6 Eng. 504, it was recognize an settle in this court, that accoring to the law merchant the enorsement of a note past ue, was equivalent to the rawing of a new bill by the enorser upon the maker in favor of the enorsee, payable on eman. That, in orer to charge the enorser in such .case, payment must be emane of the maker within a reasonable time after the enorsement, an ue notice of his refusal .given to the enorser. An that what woul be a reasonable time, though epening to some extent on the situation of the parties, an the circumstances of each case, is always a question of law for the court, accoring as the facts might be proven or amitte.
Our opinion is that if the rights an liabilities of parties to negotiable paper are sought to be ascertaine an fixe accoring to the law merchant, new to some extent, an not generally practice in this State, its rules, so far as applicable to our system of law, ought, for the best interests of all whom they may concern, to be aopte, as they are unerstoo accoring to the most approve authorities an steaily ahere tol
In this case the enorsement having the effect of a bill payable on eman, no ays of grace were allowe. As the parties all resie in the same town where the enorsements were mae, the enorsee was boun to make presentment an eman payment of the maker, in person, or at his usual place of business, or at his resience, on the ay of the enorsement, or on the ay following, an to give notice of non-payment to the enorser on the ay of the presentment, or on the next succeeing ay. The temporary absence of the maker i not excuse presentment at his place of business or aboe. As the unertaking of the enorser was conitional that he woul pay if the maker i not, upon presentment in ue season, an upon his being uly notifie of the maker’s efault, it evolve on the enorsee to prove that he ha use the iligence require of him, or such facts, if they existe, as woul by law ispense with it.
Without unertaking to lay own any rule of universal application, as to what constitutes reasonable iligence, it suffices here to say that the elay of the holer for 25 ays, without any attempt to make presentment, or give notice of non-payment, where the parties resie in the same place, amounte to such negligence as woul ischarge the enorser.

James F. Lee brought his suit in replevin against John Row-ark, for a mule. The general issue was pleae, an by consent of parties, the case was submitte to the court sitting as a jury. After having hear the evience the court foun for the plaintiff, an as the property ha not been replevie an elivere to the plaintiff, the court also hear evience, as well touching the amages for the etention of the property as the value thereof, an renere a jugment in his favor for the same. Whereupon, the efenant move the court to grant him a new trial, because the fining of the court was contrary to law an evience; which motion the court overrule. The efenant excepte an mae the evience matter of recor by his bill of exceptions.
The questions presente an argue by counsel are, first, as to the sufficiency of the evience to sustain the fining of the court; an secon, that it was error in the court to rener an absolute jugment for the value of the property.
As regars the first question, there can be no oubt but that the evience is sufficient to uphol the fining of the court. There is no lack of evience upon any point necessary to a recovery; an although the evience of several of the witnesses is somewhat contraictory, as well with regar to the purchase of the mule by the plaintiff, as the ientity of the mule in the efenant’s possession, as the same purchase by the plaintiff, it was the peculiar province of the court sitting as a jury to weigh the evience an etermine the facts, an having one so, we o not feel at liberty to isturb the verict.
After fining the issue for the plaintiff, the court, uner the circumstances of the case, properly ascertaine the value of the mule, but faile to rener a jugment thereon, in accorance with the statute. Section 39, ch. 13G Dig., provies “that in case the plaintiff shall recover jugment upon the whole recor, he shall be entitle, in aition to jugment for amages an costs, to a further jugment, that the property be replevie an elivere to him without elay; or in efault thereof, that the plaintiff recover from the efenant the value of the property ascertaine by the court or jury. Uner the provisions of the statute, the court shoul have renere jugment that the property be replevie an elivere; as well as for the value thereof. Uner the provisions of the statute jugment, when properly renere, the efenant may surrener the property an ischarge himself from the payment of the amages: but by the jugment, as renere in this case, he is eprive of the privilege of oing so.
For this error the jugment of the Circuit Court must be reverse, an the cause remane with instructions to the court below to rener jugment on the verict an fining of the court in accorance with this opinion.",legal_case,positive

This is an action of replevin brought by the appellees against the appellants, for the wrongful taking of slaves. The efenants file two pleas, non cepit an property in themselves, as the executors of the last will an testament of Freerick Notrebe, ecease. By written consent an agreement, an agree statement of the facts was submitte to the court as a special verict.
The facts or special verict is substantially this: John Baptiste Bellette an his wife, Elizabeth Bellette resie with, or in the immeiate vicinity of Freerick Notrebe, (who ha marrie their aughter,) for twenty-five years, an uring that time, an prior to the 17th of July, 1835, the sai John Baptiste ha renere services to sai Freerick, in the management of his business. In consieration of which an one ollar, on the ay last aforesai, the sai Freerick, by ee in fee simple, conveye to the sai John Baptiste, two lots of lan in the village of Arkansas. An at the same time, by a separate ee, for the same consieration, he grante, bargaine, an sol to the sai John Baptiste, five negro slaves, who with their incréase, are the slaves now in suit, as his absolute property an estate- An on the same ay, sai Notrebe also execute to the sai Bellette’the following instrument, to wit: “Know all men by these presents, that I, Freerick Notrebe, of the Post of Arkansas, Territory an county of Arkansas, eclare to whom it may concern, that my father-in-law, John B. Bellette (alias Enselma) renere me services 25 years, an by his care, economy an continue assiuity to protect my interests, has been an aitional han to help me in accumulating an saving some property. An in consequence a remuneration from me to him, is only just an equitable, an without any cause whatever prejuicial to my chilren, I am willing, an by these presents, o will that my sai father-in-law be inepenent in his ol age from the caprice of my sai chilren, an for these reasons alone, (not incluing many others of some weight) an in case I ie before him, as Go an Provience best knows, I wish an inten, that he shall take out of my estate, before any ivien be mae by my chilren, or their representatives, the sum of three thousan ollars, in lawful money, or the equivalent in property at a fair valuation, at his option; an I absolutely will an orer that my heirs, executors, or aministrators shall truly an honestly execute this act, as a legitimate compensation ue to the sai J. B. Bellette, the father of my ear an belove wife, Felicite. I also wish an inten, that shoul my mother-in-law, Elizabeth Bellette, o service to my sai father-in-law an myself, then, that she will receive the legal interest of the sai onation of $3,000, for her lifetime, an request my chilren to a any surplus, (if they are able) to give her a full competency, an to rener her happy. The house an the slaves given to my father-in-law, by two instruments of wi'iting, bearing the same ate as this one, will be also her property for life, an shall have an keep possession, to enjoy.it as her own property.”
These three instruments were uty execute an elivere to the sai Bellette, in whose hans they remaine until his eath; until which time the female slaves continue in his possession an exclusivé use, an the males also, or others in their place. Notrebe, uring the lifetime of Bellette, set up no claim to the slaves, but on the contrary, amitte the title to be in Bellette, by offering to buy or swap for one of them. He i, however, pay taxes on them in his own name. The families (Notrebe an Bellette’s) live pretty much as one family, though occupying ifferent builings. Notrebe furnishe provisions for both. Bellette ie in possession of the slaves in 1838. After his eath Mrs. Bellette occupie a room in the same house with Notrebe as a member of his family. In 1843 or 1844 Notrebe enie Mrs. Bellette’s right to the property. In 1843 he mae his will, the tenth article of which is as follows: “Having alreay given as a gift by a ee, an a bill of sale uner ate of July the 17th, 1835, some property an slaves to the late John B. Bellette, (alias Enselma) my father-in-law, which has not been expene by him in his lifetime, the same property is to be revertible as a life estate to his wiow, Elizabeth Bellette, my mother-in-law, an having also secure to the sai late John B. Bellette ecease, by an instrument of writing, uner ate July 17th, 1835, a sum of three thousan ollars in property, at fair valuation, to be receive from my estate after my ecease, if in nee of it, now the same clause is also in favor of, an revertible to the sai Elizabeth Bellette, my mother-in-law, an my absolute will an esire are, that this promise be effecte after my ecease, if she is in want, an to be fulfille to the last point. An I recommen my belove wife, an my two heirs, John an Mary, to continue to cherish her in her ol age, an to treat her well in procuring my mother-in-law as goo a maintainance as circumstances will enable my wife an two heirs, John an Mary, for their goo ol mother an granmother.”
In 1849, Notrebe ie, leaving his wife an mother-in-law, the plaintiffs in this suit, who uner the facts above, claim jointly the slaves in controversy. The efenants on the other han, claim the slaves as the executors of the last will of Mr. Notrebe.
The court below upon the agree facts, or special verict eclare the law to be in favor of the plaintiffs an renere jugment accoringly. From which ecision, uner the special reservation of exception in the submission of the facts to the court, the efenant excepte, an by appeal has brought the-case before us for ecision.
There is in this case no question as to facts, they having been ascertaine an agree upon, an we are calle upon to eclare the law which arises upon them.
At the outset it is contene by the appellant, that the three first instruments bearing the same ate an mae touching the same subject matter, shoul be taken as one instrument; an that as the latter was testamentary in its character, the others must follow it, an thereby they shoul all be so consiere. It is true that these several instruments werebetween the same parties, an were eviently intene for atwo-fol common purpose: to provie means for the present comfort an inepenent support of an age relative, an also, in case of contingency to provie for further support after the eath of the obligor or onor. The present wants of Mr. Bellette were supplie by an absolute ee for a house, an slaves to wait upon an work for him. The first two instruments, absolute an unconitional, effecte this; an although there is manifeste throughout a praiseworthy solicitue on the part of Mr. Notrebe to provie for his father-in-law, above all care for remuneration, still it is expressly amitte by him, an we must so consier it, that these instruments were mae upon a full an valuable consieration. They are neither gifts nor legacies, but ees of sale upon valuable consieration, not to take effect at a future ay, but instantly, an which, in this instance, was followe up by the actual possession an enjoyment of the property. Mr. Notrebe amitte the property to be Mr. Billette’s until after his eath, an after that time, as we shall presently see, he might well have asserte claim to the property. The thir instrument, it is true, relates to the same subject matter, an although that too, is acknowlege to be upon full consieration, an only what is ue, it is mae to epen upon two contingencies; first, the eath of Mr.- Notrebe, an seconly, the pecuniary circumstances of Mr. Bellette. Amitting the testamentary character of this instrument in several leaing particulars, we are not of opinion it can raw to it the other two instruments an efeat their obvious intent an legal effect.
If we were permitte to consier these as voluntary gifts, without other consieration than the respect an regar of Mr. Notrebe for his father-in-law, an a sense of uty to provie for him the means of support, after he, by his eath, shoul be no longer permitte to o so, then the argument of counsel an authorities cite, to which we have given attentive consieration, woul have their full force an application, but these instruments evience a sale of property to pay a ebt, a ebt amitte by Mr. Notrebe, an therefore conclusive upon him. By the force an effect of each of them, a perfect title veste in Mr. Bellette, which no subsequent act of Mr. Notrebe coul efeat. If the effect of the thir instrument, as contene for, is to constitute these three instruments one, an to make them all testamentary, then Mr. Notrebe woul have ha an unquestionable right to revoke them at pleasure uring his life. But surely it cannot be contene that a bill of sale vesting an absolute title in slaves, upon full an valuable consieration coul, after its execution, be revoke; an yet such must be the consequence, if the argument of counsel be correct. The very nature of these instruments forbis that they shoul be consiere testamentary. In the case of Habergham vs. Vincent, 2 Ves. Jr. 204, the ee was execute after the will, mae in reference to it, an coul only exist in it: whatever title passe was in reference to the will. Here the bill of sale was at the same ate, upon full consieration, an coul well exist an take effect without reference to the thir instrument. We are satisfie that the slaves passe to Mr. Bellette, an were hel by him as his absolute property, an at his eath, became the property of Mr. Notrebe, by virtue of his marriage with the aughter an sole heir of Mr. Bellette, subject to the ower interest of his wife, Mrs. Elizabeth Bellette. At the eath of Mr. Notrebe, uner the provisions of the tenth article of his will, Mr. Bellette acquire a life estate in the slaves. Of course, as Mr. Notrebe hel them subject to her ower interest, he coul only convey by will such interest as he ha, which when taken in connection with her ower interest veste in her an absolute estate for life.
We have not overlooke the statute, sec. 56, Dig. ch. 4, which exempts property acquire by the wiow from sale,to pay ebts, &c., but that statute coul not in our opinion affect the right of the husban to sell or evise the estate.
This being our conclusion, it follows, that Mrs. Notrebe has no present interest or estate in the slaves an was improperly mae a party plaintiff in the suit.
Mrs. Bellette’s right as evisee veste at the eath of Mr. Notrebe, but the question is, can she assert such right by action at law against the executor. We shoul think not; at least until the ebts are pai, or time allow'e for paying them, because she takes her title uner the will, subject to the payment of ebts, an the estate passes into the hans of the executor in the first place to satisfy ebts. Upon this point we have been referre to several authorities, which we think quite satisfactory. Anrews vs. Hunneman. 6 Pick. Rep. 129. Toller's Ex. 306. Lynch vs. Thomas, 3 Leigh 682, settle the question as to the right of the executor to hol the property in the first instance for the payment of ebts. The right of the legatee to his legacy is suspene, until by the assent of the executor or the lapse of time, for the settlement of the estate, this suspension is remove. Thus in Mississippi, where A. bequeathe a slave to B., which was in B’s possession at the testator’s eath, it was hel that the executor might recover hire for the perio of one year after the grant of letters testamentary, he having until that time to examine into an settle the estate. King vs. Cooper, Walker's Miss. Rep. 389.
Replevin is a possessory action, an the plaintiff, in orer to maintain it, must have at the commencement of his suit, a right to the possession. Uner the circumstances of this case, it is consistent with the rights of the parties an the evience, to suppose that the slaves w'ere, at the time of Mr. Notrebe’s eath, in. the possession of either Mrs. Bellette or himself. They both live together; the slaves ha been up to the eath of Mr. Bellette, in his possession, an after his eath became by operation of law, the joint property of Mr. Notrebe as heir, in right of his wife, an of Mrs. Bellette as the wiow entitle to ower. If, after the eath of Mr. Notrebe, she retaine an possese herself of the slaves, an the estate of Mr. Notrebe was clearly sufficient to pay his ebts without rawing upon specific legacies, then slight circumstances might be sufficient from which to infer assent; such as continue acquiescence by the executor in her possession, after time ha been allowe to examine into the conition of the estate. How this was, the facts as agree upon o not show.
In view, therefore, of the whole case, without unertaking to say, from the facts before us, whether Mrs. Bellette might or not have maintaine her action in replevin for the recovery of the slaves in her own right, it is very clear that no action coul be maintaine by Mrs. Bellette an Mrs. Notrebe jointly, because, as we have seen, Mrs. Notrebe ha neither title nor right of possession to the slaves.
The court below therefore erre in eciing the question of law arising upon the agree facts or special verict, in favor of the right of the plaintiffs jointly to maintain their action, an in renering jugment thereon for the plaintiffs.
Let the jugment be reverse an set asie.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of assumpsit by Hill, McLean & Co , against the appellee. The eclaration contains the common counts for goos sol an elivere, money pai, for interest an on account state. The only evience auce to sustain the action was the eposition of a witness, taken in New Orleans, who states, “that the account marke A, hereto annexe, showing a balance ue to Hill, McLean & Co., of five hunre an forty-seven ollars an fifty cents, by Emon P. Rucker is correct;” an he also annexe to his eposition the invoices marke B, an three hills of laing marke 1, 2 an 3. The same witness further state that it is customary for commission merchants to charge eight per cent, interest on open accounts. The ac count exhibite shows the total amount of ebits, as state by the witness, but there are no creits appearing, so as to make that amount a balance, or from which any recognition of the correctness of the account by the efenant coul be inferre. The exhibit B consists of bills of goos, some of which appear to have been consigne to A. Hays, Napoleon, for account of E. P. Ruck-er, Rucker’s Laning, Arkansas river; an another portion to J. A. McAlister & Co., Nashville, for account of E. P. Rucker. The copies exhibite of the bills of laing, show that certain goos were shippe by Hill, McLean & Co., at New Orleans, some of them on the Cotton Plant, marke “E. P. Rucker,” an consigne to Hays, at Napoleon, an another portion on the Harry Hill, marke “M. L. Rucker, Murphreesboro, Tennessee,” consigne to McAlister & Co., at Nashville. In the account, the items are charge uring the month of July 1847, the invoices are without ate, an the bills of laing are ate in November an December, 1847. The plaintiffs also prove, by another witness, that the efenant, Rucker, was a planter on the Arkansas river in the year 1847. This being all the evience in the case, the court instructe the jury, that they shoul fin for the efenant, unless the plaintiffs have proven either that the efenant orere the goos, or that he receive them, an that the shipment of the goos an taking bills of laing therefor, in the manner shown by the eposition referre to, is not sufficient evience of a receipt of them by the efenant, but there must be proof of an actual receipt of the goos by him, if they were not orere.
Such, in substance, was the instruction given, the propriety of which is not questione; but it appears that the court, in response to an- enquiry from the jury, tol them, that the eposition was evience, but not sufficient for them to fin a verict for the plaintiffs, who shoul have prove that the efenant ha either orere or receive the goos: an it is argue, for the appellants that such- charge, in- the terms given,, was- an invasion by the court below of the province of the jury.
Accoring to the settle practice in this State, the court has no power to orer a peremptory non-suit, Martin & Van Horne vs. Webb, 5 Ark. 72. Ringo vs. Fiel, 1 Eng. 48, but the practice has prevaile for the court, sitting as a jury, or the jury uner instructions from the court, to fin as in case of non-suit, which is a etermination of the case upon the merits as presente by the evience, a bar to any future action for the same cause, an to which error lies, Fagan vs. Faulkner, 5 Ark. 161. Cocke vs. Brogan, ib. 694. Palmer & Southmay vs. Ashley & Ringo, 3 ib. 75, though the correctness of it was oubte in Goorich vs. Fritz, 4 Ark. 525, an in Carr vs. Crain, 2 Eng. 249, repeate in The State use &c., vs. Roper, 3 ib. 493, the court sai, “ The correct motion is to instruct the jury that if the evience has not prove a matter necessary to be proven, they must fin for the efenant,” though in the two last cases mentione, the istinction oes not appear to be notice, that to orer a non-suit is to say the jury shall not pass on the evience, while the letter authority is that the court has not this power, an that the plaintiff has the right to have the jury pass on his case, an to be conclue if he will by the jugment, which being final entitles him to a revision in the appellate court. But to instruct the jury to fin as in, case of non-suit, is only the opinion of the court.that the plaintiff has faile to make out his case in evience, an so far from taking the case from the jury is every way favorable to the plaintiff, because it is analogous to a emurrer to evience, where all-legitimate presumptions of fact are to be inulge in favor of the evience.
There is therefore no real iscrepancy between the cases averte to, an they all ten to establish, that however angerous it may be for a efenant to ask the court to instruct the jury to' fin as in case of non-suit, or that the plaintiff has faile to make out his case in evience, it is no assumption of power for the court-to give such an instruction, the only question being whether it was properly given. In this case the real truth may be, that the efenant was resisting payment of a just eman, an that the apparent inconsistencies in the eposition coul have been reconcile an any efect of proof supplie by further testimony; but accoring to the case presente on the recor, the jury coul not-have been justifie by the evience in fining a verict for the plaintiffs, an consequently the expression of such an opinion by the court was erroneous. The statement of the witness who epose that the account exhibite showing a certain balance ue the plaintiffs from the efenant was correct, might have been honestly mae, as appearing to him from the books of the plaintiffs; but it cannot be stretche to mean that the witness was personally cognizant of the transactions about which he testifie, or to amount to proof that the efenant, not shown to have receive the goos, ha orere or bargaine for them, so as to be1come chargeable for their value by the elivery of them to a carrier.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The action in this case was brought upon the official bon of a sheriff, against himself an his securities. After setting out the bon with its conitions, the plaintiff avers that Nancy Perry-man, for whose use the suit is brought, commence her action in replevin for slaves, against William Drew in the Sebastian Circuit Court, an sue out her writ of replevin, which, whilst in full force, was place in the hans of the qualifie eputy of sai Stephens, who was then sheriff of Sebastian county, by which he was commane that if the sai Nancy Perryman shoul give security as require by law, that he cause sai slaves to be replevie an elivere to her; that sai sheriff i, whilst sai writ was in full force, by his eputy, take sai slaves by virtue thereof into his possession. An the plaintiff then alleges, as a breach of the official uty of sai sheriff that he refuse to take bon an security as require by law, from sai Nancy Perryman; but frauulently intening to injure an cheat her out of the negroes, elivere them to sai Drew.
The secon count is in all respects like the first, with this ifference, that it is allege for a breach, that sai sheriff, by his eputy, took the slaves into possession, by virtue of sai writ, but woul not, an i not take bon from the sai Nancy Perryman as require by law, an wholly faile an refuse to o so.
To this eclaration a emurrer was file, the groun of which was, that the breach assigne in each is insufficient in this, that it was not sufficient to aver that the sheriff refuse to take a bon, fyc., or that he woul not take such bon, or i not take it, but that in orer to charge the sheriff for a breach of official uty, it was necessary to aver that the sai Nancy Perryman, or some one for her, execute an tenere such bon, as require by law, to the sheriff before he execute his writ, or took the property into possession uner it. The emurrer was sustaine by the Circuit Court, an the plaintiff having ecline to amen, final jugment was renere in favor of the efenants, from which the plaintiff appeale.
There can be no oubt but that the sheriff was not only not boun to take the property into possession, without first having the security require by the statute, but it was clearly his uty to esist from any attempt to execute the writ until such bon was tenere to him. The comman in his writ is conitional: that “if the plaintiff shall give you security,” &c., “you cause the goos an chattels to be replevie an elivere to the plaintiff,” &c.
The 10th sec. Dig. ch. 146, provies that such writ shall not be execute in any case, unless the plaintiff, or some other person in his behalf, shall execute bon, &c. An the 12th sec. provies “that upon the receipt of such writ an bon before require, the sheriff shall forthwith procee to execute such writ,” &c. No one can rea these sections without being satisfie that the sheriff exceee his power an authority in taking the slaves into his possession, without having receive the bon intene for the protection an security of the efenant, an that having one soj he was uner no obligation to retain the property so taken; inee, it was his uty at once to restore it to the efenant. The statute oes not require of the sheriff to prepare a bon, nor to eman one, but before he is authorize or require to execute the writ, it is the uty of the plaintiff to make, by herself, or some one for her, a goo an sufficient bon, conitione as require by the statute with sufficient surety, an to tener it to the officer. Then shoul he refuse or neglect to perform his uty he may be hel to account by the party injure; an shoul he, as in this instance, improviently take the property into his possession without first having receive such bon, (to place the case in the most favorable attitue for the plaintiff,) it was the plaintiff’s uty to prepare an tener such bon before the sheriff coul be hel accountable for not elivering the property to her.
The language use in the breach oes not necessarily imply that a bon was tenere. A “refusal to take a bon,” or in the secon count, “that the sheriff i not an woul not take a bon,” are not equivalent to a tener an offer of a bon, prepare as require by law. The grouns of the refusal or failure to take bon are not state. The plaintiff may have offere to prepare a bon, an the sheriff have ecline to hol up the property until it was one, or for other cause, an uner the rule'that the pleaer must be suppose to have presente the facts in the most favorable aspect for his client, we must presume that ha a bon been tenere an offere to the sheriff it woul have been so state.
We think the grouns for the emurrer well taken.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This suit is brought against Ruell alone, on the joint obligation of Moore an himself. The bon was barre by the statute of limitations, unless the bar was remove by part payment-The efenant pleae the statute of limitations, to which the plaintiff replie generally. Uner this issue, the plaintiff offere evience of such part payment, but the efenant objecte to the evience upon two grouns, first, that the evience offere was-incompetent an inamissible to prove part payment; an secon, that if amissible as evience in other respects, it u as inamissible uner the issue forme. The court overrule his objections an permitte the evience to be given uner the issue, to which the efenant excepte. The same question was again-presente upon a motion for a new trial; an upon exception to-the opinion of the court in refusing, to grant a new trial, the case* is brought here by appeal.
Uner the issue forme it evolve upon the plaintiff to prove-that the cause of action ha accrue within five years next before-the commencement of the suit, which ates from-the filing of the bon, which, uner the statute, is in effect a eclaration, an the issuing of the writ thereon, an the time- when the bon fell ue ; facts to be establishe by the terms of the contract, an the recor evience of the commencement of the suit. If the plaintiff shoul seek to avoi the force an effect of this evience,by show-in§,a new promise, or a new an ifferent point from which the-statute bar commence to run, it is an affirmative matter, the truth of which he must show, an he must also necessarily confess the time at which the bar, by the terms of the contract, commence running. It is then necessarily like matter in confession an avoiance, an shoul be so replie.
Chitty, in his work on pleaing, vol. 1, page 583, says that, when the plea is that the cause of action i not accrue within, &c., the plaintiff coul prove a promise or acknowlegment within.that time, an that the replication might, in such case, be general; but if the time of issuing the first writ in the action were material, it must have been replie specially : an as, that a special replication is, in general, avisable. An upon this istinction as to whether the plea oes, or oes not put the time of issuing the writ in issue, rest all the cases to which the plaintiff has referre, except the cases ecie in Massachusetts Reports, which, upon quite a ifferent state of case, give preference to the proceeing by special replication, an in case the time of issuing the writ is putin issue, make it inispensably necessary to plea specially. Greenleaf, in his work on Evience, vol. 2, sec. 440, page 416, says, “ that if the plaintiff woul avoi the bar by proof of an acknowlegment of the claim, he can only o it uner a special replication of a new promise within the time limite.” An so, also, the exceptions in favor of merchant an merchant, an other exceptions must be replie specially. I. sec. 447-448.
In the case of Trustees vs. Hartfiel, 5 Ark. Rep. 557, the precise question as to whether part payment coul or not be given in evience uner the general replication, was not iscusse; but the court in passing upon the sufficiency of the special replication, hel, that part payment might be given uner the general replication, or might be replie specially.
In Walker vs. Bank Mississippi, 2 Eng. Rep. 504, although the question was not irectly before the court, an for that reason cannot be hel as overruling in express terms the case of Trustees vs. Hartfiel, the court hel that an avoiance of the statute bár by limitation, uner any of the exceptions of the statute, shoul be specially replie. An in Ringgol & Hynson vs. Dunn, 3 Eng. 497, the same rule was hel, when more fully presente, an in still stronger terms. In McClellan vs. The Bank, 7 Eng. 141, where a general replication was file to a plea of the statute of limitation, the recor of a former suit brought on the same cause of action was offere in evience, to bring the case within the exception of the 24th section, Dig. chap. 99, which allows the plaintiff to renew his action within one year next after a jugment of non-suit, it was hel that in orer to let in evience of such former suit, the plaintiff shoul have file a special replication setting up such facts in avoiance of the statute bar.
An in the case of Woos vs. State Bank, 7 Eng. 697, an also in a case still more recently ecie, Bank vs. Conway, January term, 1853, it was hel the safer an more regular practice to require part payment, when relie upon to remove the statute bar, to be specially replie. So that it is not now an open question of practice, but one sactione an approve by this court, both upon soun principles of pleaing an authority: an being, in our opinion, best calculate to present the efinite matter in issue isencumbere from the other facts which might arise uner the general replication, an to limit the proof to it, we o not feel at liberty to epart from it.
Evience of part payment was, therefore, inamissible uner the issue as forme, an shoul have been exclue by the court, inepenent of all consieration of its sufficiency otherwise, which we will next procee to consier.
There were several creits upon the bon, all of which, except one, purporte to be payments mae by Moore, the obligor, not sue. The first payment appears to have been mae by Moore, an, if proven to have been mae at the time it bore ate, woul have remove the statute bar. To prove this the plaintifF offere in evience the following instrument, to-wit: “All of the above creits were mae by me, except the three ollars, an the ates of the creits are correct. Decir. 2, 1850. (signe) Wm. Moore.” An after proving the execution thereof, offere the same, together with the first enorsement of a payment (which purporte to have been mae by Moore) as evience, an the same, against the objections of the efenant, were amitte as evience to the jury.
In orer to prove part payment, as against a co-obligor, it must be shown that such payment was mae at a time when its legal effect woul be to remove the statute bar. Bank vs. Wooy, 5 Eng. 643. Woo vs. Wyls, 6 Eng. 759. The mere enorsement of a creit, as of a ate to effect this, isjnot of itself sufficient: but it must be shown that the enorsement of payment was in fact mae within such time. But where the enorsement is mae by the obligors, or one of them, then proof of that fact will be sufficient evience to permit the enorsement to be rea as evience, as well of the ate as the fact of payment.
After the statute bar has attache no act or amission of one •co-obligor will bin another. Trustees vs. Jenkins, et al. 5 Eng. 108. Such acts an amissions are alone bining upon the party making them. Moore’s amissions, therefore, at the time when they were mae, whether wiitten or verbal, were inamissible as evience against Ruell, an shoul have been exclue. He was not sue, an was clearly a competent witness to prove the fact of such payment, as well as the time when it was mae, whether mae by Ruell or himself.

1862695,Viser vs. Bertrand,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins.
This was an action of assumpsit with a count for professional services, the common money counts, an an account state, brought by Bertran against Mrs. Yiser, the plaintiff in error. The bill of exceptions isclose a claim for $150, charge as an attorney’s fee, an $300 money avance for her, an at her request.
The evience on the trial conuce to show the following state of facts. Bertran ha been the attorney of Mrs. Yiser in prosecuting a suit in the Pulaski Circuit Court, against her husban for ivorce, an for his services in conucting that suit, the fee of $150 was charge. It appears that Mrs. Yiser ha several negroes, which she claime as her separate estate, but in which Yiser also claime- an interest by virtue of his marital rights 1 Mrs. Yiser, the complainant, was living in LittleRock, an Yiser, the husban, was in New Orleans. A negotiation ensue between the parties to that suit, through the meium of their respective attorneys, the result of which was, in the language of Yiser’s attorney, the only material witness to this point, that “Mrs. Yiser’s attorney agree that she woul pay me $300 for Yiser, if he woul relinquish his claim to the negroes an make no further opposition to the ivorce, which as Yiser’s attorney, I accepte.” The attorney of Viser wrote to him at New Orleans, an obtaine his ee of relinquishment of the negroes. The ee was execute to Bertran, an elivere to him, with the unerstaning that, after the ivorce, he was to convey to Mrs. Yiser. Bertran on behalf of Mrs. Yiser, gave his obligation for the payment of the $300. Subsequently, in July, 1850, Mrs. Yiser obtaine a ecree in the ivorce suit, Yiser making no opposition. The payment of the $300, was elaye for some time after the ecree, the excuse being that Mrs. Viser ha not succeee in raising the money by the sale of one of the negroes, as was intene, an which she mae some efforts to o. Accoring to my unerstaning of the recor there was evience conucing to show that Mrs. Yiser, after the ivorce, requeste Bertran to avance the money for her, until she coul raise it by a sale or mortgage of one of the negroes, or from which the jury might have inferre the fact of such request, which however, I o not regar as material. Finally, Bertran, who, not long after the ivorce, ha pai $100 aboutthe first of February, 1851, close the matter by giving his note for the remaining $200 to Yiser’s attorney, who accepte it with the unerstaning that he woul pay it whenever calle on; the witness, however, up to the time of the trial, ha not calle on Bertran for the money. There was abunant evience showing that after the ivorce Mrs. Yiser, the efenant below, acknowlege her inebteness to the plaintiff for his fee, which was agree to be settle at $100 an also for the $300 avance or assume to be pai by him for her to Yiser, an that she, on several occasions promise to pay him those sums.
On the trial in the court below, various instructions were aske for, the repetition of which in etail as given, moifie or refuse, woul be as little calculate to eluciate the ecision here as they were the issues before the jury. The points mae on behalf of the efenant below were, as gathere from the instructions aske, that as the retainer of the plaintiff an the contract or agreement about the payment of the $300, ha their inception whilst the efenant was a feme covert, such contract was absolutely voi an not bining on her; an being so, no subsequent promise by her, after she became iscovert, without some new or further consieration was shown to uphol it, woul amount to a ratification, or make such new promise bining upon her in law Seconly, that the plaintiff coul not recover for money pai, as to so much of the claim for which he ha given his note, an which i not appear to have been pai. The court below seeming to regar these propositions as law, instructe the jury on behalf of the plaintiff, that if they believe from the evience that the efenant mae a new contract, after the ivorce was grante to her, upon a sufficient consieration, to pay the $300 an the fee, they might nevertheless fin for the plaintiff uner the count upon an account state, but upon the return of the jury reporting a isagreement the court appears to have charge that, although the original contract was voi in law, yet if she mae a new promise to pay since she was ivorce, the consieration receive by her uring coverture, is sufficient to sustain such new promise, which became bining so as to authorize a recovery against her in that action.
It is certainly a rule of the common law that the contract of a marrie woman is voi. Her legal existence becomes merge in that of the husban, who, as he assumes her ebts, acquires as it were, a ominion of her estate as well as her person. She coul make no contract, the enforcement of which might eprive the husban of her society, or which coul be obligatory upon her, because of the legal presumption that it was mae uner uress. The wife may impose a liability upon the husbanby acting as his agent, by his express or implie authority, but then the contract is his. The husban being liable for her support an maintainance. the law will oblige him to furnish it, an in case of his refusal, where necessaries are furnishe to her, the law imposes the obligation an implies a promise on his part to pay for them. It woul seem that her contracts are voi by reason of incapacity to contract, an not voiable like those of an infant, to whom the law affors a protection, of which he may avail himself or waive at his pleasure.
But it has long been the establishe octrine of courts of equity, that in regar to her separate estate, the wife may have rights inepenent of, an averse to those of her husban, which will be protecte, an her liabilities in respect of such estate, enforce in that forum. When we consier the increasing tenency of legislation in this, as in other States, to emancipate the wife from the ominion of the husban, by securing to marrie women their separate property, an authority to acquire an hol it in their own names, ischarge from liabilities incurre by the husban, it behooves us to enquire whether it be the policy or esign of such legislation to exempt the separate property of the wife from liability, though it might have to be'enforce in a court of equity» upon her contracts in respect of such property. Wherever there is free agency an sufficient mental capacity, the right to contract, an the power of alienation ought to be inseparable from the ownership of property. It may inee be limite within the perio beyon which, the restraint woul become obnoxious as a perpetuity, so that where a separate estate is settle upon a woman in contemplation of marriage, the terms of the settlement an the powers conferre by it might have to be pursue in orer to enable the woman to charge her estate; yet it cannot be sai to be the policy of the law in this country, that property shoul be tie up from alienation, or absolve from the just ebts of the real owner; an the statute enabling marrie women to acquire an hol property irectly, instea of through the intervention of a trustee, is one of the many eviences of the isposition to o away with the istinction between law an equity, or rather to require courts oí law, in all cases where they are capable of afforing aequate relief, to aminister law in the spirit of equity.
Supposing in this case the money to have been fairly avance or assume to be pai, for the purpose of securing to the woman her separate property, or to quiet by way of compromise any oubtful claim of the husban to the usufruct', I apprehen it is not questione; but that the claim of the plaintiff below was such as coul have been enforce in a court of equity, an uring her coverture as against the property. The parties were living apart, an the treaty was concerning her separate property. So far from the husban being liable, he was the averse party in interest, an the wife by her agent or trustee, was contracting with him. The attorney thus acting as her agent, woul have a lien in equity upon the property for the moneys avance at her request, to secure her in the ownership or enjoyment of it. Even the court granting the ivorce, if satisfie of the fairness of the transaction, might have mae a summary orer, requiring the money so avance to be refune, an charging the payment of it upon the property ecree to the wife. Because to the .extent that a feme covert is capable of contracting, in a court of equity, she stans on the same footing with other persons, an is regare as a feme sole, uner no isability whatever. In the case of infants, who o labor uner a isability, where they avail themselves of the privilege, any court having the power, woul compel them to surrener an avantage or make restitution of property, which woul cease to be theirs, an be unjustly retaine upon the repuiation of the contract by which it was acquire.
So, a reasonable compensation for his services, to the attorney of a marrie woman, is chargeable upon her separate estate. If the suit is for ivorce, the complaint on the part of the wife, selom mae out of levity, but more often resorte to as a esperate remey for intolerable wrongs, though not to be encourage, is so far favore, that the court to which she appeals will eneavor to place her upon something like an equality with the contesting husban. If she have no separate estate the allowance to her for maintainance pening the suit, or for alimony by the ecree, are funs out of which she might be require to compensate her attorney. To eny to her the power of bining her estate for the retainer of competent professsional ai, so far from being an avantage, woul be to isarm her in a contest alreay unequal^ an require her to come into court efenceless save as an object of sympathy.
I am clearly of opinion, that if the jury believe the facts which I suppose the evience conuce to prove, (leaving out of view another feature in the cause to be presently notice,) the plaintiff below was entitle to recover upon the express promise of the efenant after she became iscovert, without any new or further consieration for the promise being mae to appear: an I rest my opinion istinctly upon the groun that the promise was bining, not by force of any mere moral obligation resting upon her, but because the contract or agreement mae uring coverture, whereby she receive an avantage, an the plaintiff below suffere a isavantage, was of such a nature as to be vali an bining upon her estate as a feme covert an a sufficient consieration to uphol her promise as a feme sole.
I o not unerstan the case of Lee vs. Muggrige, 5 Taun. 36, an the cases which followe it, to have been oubte or overrule, except to the extent of the loose expressions containe in that case, to the effect that any moral obligation is a sufficient consieration to uphol an express promise. The law is now well settle the other way, an without tracing the course of the ecisions, a correct exposition of it is containe in the more recent cases of Eastwoo vs. Kenyon, 11 A. & Ellis 438, in Englan, an Greer vs. Archer, 2 Barbour Sup. Ct. Rep. 420, among many ecie in this country. Strictly speaking, á moral, istinguishe from a legal obligation, an where there never was anything more than a moral obligation, is never a sufficient consieration to uphol an express promise. Many instances may be imagine where a person of refine feelings an cultivate min woul hol himself, or consier another boun by strong obligations of gratitue, where voluntary compensation might well be mae, but where no promise for future compensation coul raise the uty to the slanar of a legal obligation. Such uties belong to that class of imperfect obligations, bining in conscience, but whiclffihejlaw'fioes nofrecognize an will not enforce, because it cannot appreciate the consieration, or estimate the amages for a breach of uty. Inee, no greater change in the fabric of the common law coul well be conceive, than for the courts to put moral obligations upon a footing of equality with valuable consierations to uphol contracts. Besies the vague an inefinite nature of such obligations, the liability to unjust preferences of them over creitors whom the law has recognize as more meritorious, will suffice without any further conjecture, to illustrate the startling consequences that woul result from such a change. The rule euce from a review of the cases containe in the note, so often cite an approve, to Wennall vs. Abney, 3 Bos. & Pul. 249, exclues the iea of a mere moral obligation as a sufficient consieration to support a promise, by confining its operation to those cases where there was a preceent goo consieration to support an express promise, or from which the law woul imply a promise, which might have been, or coul yet be enforce, but for the operation of some'positiverule of law, as for instance, a ebt once vali an subsisting, but ischarge in bankruptcy, or barre by limitation, or the contract, of an infant which he may confirm at majority.
It may somtimes be ifficult to istinguish, between what are legal an what are moral obligations, but when ascertaine, the istinction has no peculiar application to the contracts of marrie women, or their moral obligation for benefits conferre. It is applicable alike to all persons who have full capacity to contract. If the agreement of a feme covert to contract is vali, so as to be obligatory in equity, her promise after she becomes is-covert nee not epen upon the moral obligation; nor is the promise of one, not uner a isability, aie by any moral obligation where there never was a preceent goo consieration.
. It is true the original contract of the efenant below, while a feme covert, coul not have been enforce against her in an action at law; but if I am right in concluing that it was one for her benefit, which equity woul sanction an enforce in her favor an against her estate, it woul seem to be a technical an unfoune istinction to hol that there was no consieration to uphol her subsequent promise, because the original contract coul not have been enforce at law. I take it to be the spirit of the rule given in the note to the case in 3 Bos. Sf Pul., that wherever the promisee ha a right, upon a goo consieration, of which he might have availe himself, at law or in equity, against the promisor, an whether in the prosecution or efence of a suit, such right, though it has become unavailing, is a sufficient consieration to uphol a promise to continue or renew the former liability. The case of Littlefiel vs. Shee, 2 Barn. & Aol. 811, where the plaintiff, a butcher, ha supplie the efenant, when a marrie woman, with meat for her own use, while her husban was abroa, an after his eath she promise payment, oes ilot militate against the position that the efenant may be liable upon her promise in this case, because there, supposing the eclaration to have been free from any objection, the court must have hel that if anyboy was liable to the plaintiff it was the husban, it being in law his ebt an not that of the wife, for whose subsequent promise there coul have been no consieration beyon the suppose moral' obligation. So, in the case of Watkins vs. Halstea, 2 Saun. Sup. Ct. Rep. 311, where goos were furnishe to a marrie woman living apart from her husban, an having a separate property hel for her by a trustee, an after being ivorce from her husban, she promise to pay for the goos, the court say, “It is not pretene that inepenently of the express promise of the appellant, after she obtaine her ecree of ivorce, this action coul be sustaine. If when the ebt was contracte, when the goos were elivere any person was liable it was the husban. We see nothing in the case to exempt him from liability. The appellant was then a feme covert an clearly not liable. Her promise to pay was mae after she was ivorce, an if that promise is not supporte by aequate consieration, the action must fail.” Assuming therefore, at the outset, that the original promise was not bining on the wife, an never coul have been enforce against her, the court go into an examination of the cases an unavoiably conclue that the moral obligation resting upon her was not sufficient to support her subsequent promise.
The other point of law raise by the instructions, is settle by the ecision of this court in Neale vs. Newlan, 4 Ark. 506. See also Logan vs. Williamson, 3 Ark. 216. R. E. Bank vs. Rawon et al., 5 Ark. 569, an Joran vs. Aams. 2 Eng. 348, that a negotiable note given an accepte in payment of a ebt of a thir person, becomes an extinguishment of it, an proof of this is sufficient evience to support an action against the ebtor for money pai. An upon so much of the case, as it come up on a motion for new trial, I woul see no cause to isturb the verict.
But the efenant below, in her motion for new trial, besies renewing the legal exceptions I have been consiering, an also urging certain matters of surprise an aitional evience, which are lai wholly out of view as insufficient, move for anew trial upon the groun, then for the first time presente to the court, that the original consieration for her liability to the plaintiff was illegal an immoral, in this, that the money was avance to inuce Viser, the husban, to withraw his opposition to her suit for ivorce, which if it be true, woul be a clear case of collusion, in violation of the spirit of the statute concerning ivorces, an contrary to public policy. An after some hesitation, because the efenant, moving for a new trial, seems to stan in the attitue of one, who shoul come into equity with clean hans, I thinlc the court below shoul have grante a new trial upon this groun — not for any merit in the efenant, much less a emerit in the plaintiff who may have been acting for what he conceive to be the best interest of his client; not that I can assume the fact to be as claime, because this as a question of fact was*-' not put to the jury or passe on by them; but because there was evience conucing to show that the money was pai to inuce Viser to make no further opposition to the ivorce, as well as to relinquish his claim to the negroes. An there being such evience, it was not only the right but th.e uty of the court to have interpose of its own motion, an put it to the jury to say whether this taint entere into an forme any part of the consieration, for which the three hunre ollars were pai, an to have charge them that if they so foun, the plaintiff as to so much of his eman, coul not recover. Because, otherwise, if both parties to an immoral contract, were content not to raise such objection, the courts might be compelle to ajuicate their allege rights uner contracts of that escription, which the law woul neither enforce nor rescin. It requires no enlarge inquiry into the policy of the statute concerning ivorces, to lea to the conclusion, that if money is avance or agree to be pai in consieration that a party to a suit for a ivorce will withraw opposition, it amounts to collusion. The statute requires, in suits for ivorce, at least a ecent show of opposition, an where that is wanting, the courts shoul look to it with increase vigilance, that the complainant’s allegations are fully sustaine by evience. If the money was avance for the purpose in whole or in part of compouning the suit, it coul not be recovere back from the party to whom it was pai, an the illegal taint woul enter into an vitiate any new promise to refun mae by the party, on whose behalf it was avance.
For this groun alone, an not upon any other containe in the motion, I think a new trial shoul have been grante.
Mr. Justice Scott.
None of the reasons for the motion for a new trial are tenable, as I think, except that which sets up, that in the groun of liability presente by the plaintiff below there was such gross illegality as to be justly offensive to goo morals an soun public policy, in this, that a part of that, for which he proceee, was for money avance to inuce Yiser, the husban, not only to relinquish his claim to the negroes in ispute, but to withhol his opposition to the suit of the wife for a ivorce. The former might well be uphel, because of the law’s high favor of compromises] but its abhorrence of collusion in a suit for ivorce, is so great, that relief shoul be at once given on such groun, even at the application of a particeps .criminis. It oes not give relief, however, in such case to the party, but to the public through the party, for the promotion of ecency an public morals. An it will be affore as well where there may be just emans unite with one so tainte, as where the latter may be the sole founation of the suit; because it is the public interest alone that the law thus seeks to subserve; an it was the party’s own folly to mix a rotten eman with a soun one.
Nor shoul this groun of interposition by the court be any the less regare, because it was not moote uring the trial in chief. So far from this, it is the bounen uty of the courts to guar the public morals of the country to the full extent of their powers, an for this purpose to interpose of their own motion for their vinication on all proper occasions. Nor oes any matter touching public ecency an soun morals, an the very pith of the Jeaven of social life, so much eserve the vigilance of the courts as this very matter of ivorce. The marital tie, although a civil .contract in the eye of the law, iffers from all other civil contracts in one essential particular. The parties can never annul it by means either irect or inirect. TIence the inexible rule of law, that the confessions of either party are wholly incompetent as evience. Nor oes our statute, which irects that “like pi'ocess an proceeings shall be ha in” ivorce cases (Dig. ch. 58 p. 462, sec. 3,) “as are ha in other cases on the equity sie of the court,” or in any other of its irections, or provisions, in any way alter or moify this vital rule of evience touching the issolution of the marital tie. Parties by their mutual consent, if of proper age an capacity to receive the sanction of the law, may make the marriage tie, but they can never break it accoring to the rul es of law an the soun morals upon which itrests, by any express, confessions, much less by those implie by a efault of answer to a bill for ivorce. A contrary rule, it woul seem, coul only be certifie to the courts by express legislation, pn even then, so great woul be the inevitable abuses in its aministration, that it might not be totally unworthy of consieration whether it coul have operation among men in harmony with the paramount laws of Go.
But for this groun of the motion for a new trial, it might well enough have been refuse, as it was, because leaving out of view this matter of illegality, in which the public was thus concerne, an which the evience seems to show to exist in fact, the verict an jugment were well enough sustaine. The compromise settle the property as the separate property of the wife, an certainly quoa this, she was a feme sole in a court of equity, an liable not only for her contracts concerning it, but also for others that touche her personal benefit, if not contrary to law; an it was not unlawful for her to sue for a ivorce an employ counsel to sustain her suit.
I concur with my brother juges in awaring a new trial.
Mr. Justice Walker.
This was an action of assumpsit brought by Bertran against-Mrs. Viser. The efenant pleae the general issue, an the-case was trie by a jury, who foun a yerict for the plaintiffiThe efenant file her motion for a new trial, setting out various causes for the same, amongst which it may only be necessary to enumerate those which affirm that the court erre in the-' instructions given, an in refusing to give instructions aske by the efenant an that the verict was contrary to the evience, to law, an to the instructions of the court. The motion for a' new trial was overrule an the efenant excepte, setting out the evience, an has brought the case here by writ of error.
The plaintiff’s action is foune upon two items of charge, the nature of which we will procee to consier. The first is for professional services renere by the plaintiff in obtaining a ivorce for her. These services were contracte for an renere whilst the efenant was a feme covert, an therefore the contract as to her was voi. The plaintiff amits this, but relies upon an express promise to pay after the ivorce, upon the groun that, although no legal obligation reste upon her to pay, that her moral obligation was a sufficient consieration for such, express promise. If this contract ha been voiable instea of voi (as if mae with an infant) the question woul have been more free from oubt. The point of ifficulty is whether, if no legal obligation, ever existe, a moral obligation can be sai to exist, such as will be a sufficient consieration to uphol an express promise to pay.
Upon examination of the authorities I think it may be sai that there must be such legal obligation or a legal an sufficient consieration, such as might have been enforce through the meium of an implie promise, ha it not been suspene by the incapacity of the feme covert to contract. Kent, in his Commentaries, part 5, vol. 2, p. 258, says, “A sufficient legal obligation to o a thing is a sufficient consieration for a promise to o it; but it has been an unsettle point, whether a mere moral obligation be of itself a sufficient consieration for a promise, except in those cases in which a prior legal obligation or consieration ha once existe. The weight of authority is that it is not sufficient.”
An it is lai own by Chitty in his work on Contracts, page 47, “That an express promise can only revive a preceent goo consieration which might have been enforce at law through the meium of an implie promise, ha it not been suspene by some positive rule of law, but can give no original cause of action, if the obligation on which it is foune never coul have been enforce at law, though not barre by any legal maxim or statute provision.” The same rule is lai own in 3 Bosanquet & Puller 244. Smith vs. Vare, 13 John. R. 258.
In the case now uner consieration, although no legal obligation existe uner which the efenant coul have been compelle to pay for the professional services, still such services were a legal consieration which but for the rule of law that makes voi the contract of a feme covert, a recovery might have been ha upon an implie assumpsit, an consequently furnishe a sufficient consieration to uphol an express promise mae after the ivorce to pay for them. Nor was it necessary in orer to make the express promise bining upon the efenant, to prove affirmatively that she knew at the time the express promise was mae, that she was not boun in law by her former contract. This, in the absence of evience to the contrary must be presume.
As regars the other item of charge, the $300, the facts are these. The complainant sue her husban for a ivorce, an also set up claim to several slaves, as her separate property. Defenant employe counsel an was preparing to efen, contesting the complainant’s title to the slaves; but upon a conference between the complainant an the efenant, through their respective counsel, it was propose that complainant woul pay efenant $300, if he woul relinquish his claim to the negroes, an make no further opposition to the ivorce, which terms were agree to, an at the request of complainant, the plaintiff in this suit an his associate counsel entere into an obligation to the attorney for the husban, bining themselves to pay him the sum of $300. This contract was entere into whilst the efenant in the present action was a feme covert. The relinquishment was procure from the husban by his attorney an elivere to the plaintiff, Bertran, who still (so far as appears from the evience) retains the same. No efence was mae to the suit for a ivorce, an after it was obtaine, the efenant repeately promise to pay the sum so secure by plaintiff an his associate counsel, Lincoln. But there is no proof that efenant requeste plaintiff to pay sai sum after she was ivorce. The payment of the $100, an the note for $200 seems to have been an arrangement between the plaintiff an the attorney for the husban without special irections or request from efenant, inee she at one time, expresse to Webb, a witness, fears that her attorneys ha not acte fairly with her, an ha in fact not pai the sum aforesai. The testimony of the other witnesses, it is true, acquits the plaintiff of all unfairness, but so far as the latter arrangement of payment is concerne, this goes to show that .representions ha been mae to her about the payment of the money, with regar to the truth of which she was not satisfie. In view of the whole of the evience, there can be no oubt of a full recognition of the contract mae whilst efenant was a feme covert, an of her promise to pay it after the ivorce; but there is no evience of any new contract mae after that time, nor oes it appear from a careful review of the whole of the evience, that Bertran, the plaintiff, took in the obligation of himself an Lincoln, an pai the f 100, an gave his note for the balance at the instance of the efenant or with her consent.
Waiving then the consieration of the question, as to whether .the promise to pay the $200, coul be given in evience uner the counts in the eclaration, the main question is, that conceing the money to have been pai either before or since the ivorce was obtaine, was this a preceent goo consieration which might have been enforce at law, through the meium of an implie promise, ha it not been suspene by that rule of law which enies the valiity of the wife’s contracts mae uring coverture.
The item of charge for professional services was alone encumbere with this positive rule of law. The subject matter of the contract was not against the law, or the policy of the law. But with regar to this latter item, the $300, a part at least of the consieration an inucement to the contract was, that the husban shoul offer no efence to the suit fora ivorce. This was clearly against the policy of the statute in regar to ivorces, uner the provisions of which, the particular grouns of complaint must be set forth in the bill an sworn to. An the complainant is also require to swear that the complaint is not mae through levity, or by collusion, fear or restraint, between complainant an efenant, for the mere purpose of being separate from each other, but in sincerity an in truth, for the causes in the bill set forth.
The contract of marriage, unlike orinary contracts of business, is one which the public, as well as the iniviuals contracting, is intereste in preserving unbroken, unless for such causes as are specially set forth in the statute, an these causes must in fact exist, an must be shown to exist by evience. No amissions of the efenant, whether by answer or by failure to answer, will supersee the necessity of proof of the truth of the allegations in the bill. An every contract not to efen or withhol evience which, if prouce, woul ten to isprove the allegations in the bill, is clearly in violation of the spirit of the statute, an shoul not be enforce.
This question was istinctly presente in the case of Sayles vs. Sayles, 1 Foster’s N. H. Rep. 312, in which the valiity of a contract not to efen against a suit for ivorce came up: an there no question arose as to the capacity of the parties to contract, because the husban execute the note, an the suit for ivorce was by him, not the wife, as in this case, so that the whole question turne upon the valiity of the contract, in reference to the subject matter about which it was mae. There the husban file his bill for a ivorce; pening the suit, conversations were hel between the counsel of the respective parties which resulte in an agreement by which the complainant execute a note for $400, payable to the son of the wife, an elivere to a thir person, with the unerstaning that if the complainant succeee in obtaining a ivorce, an if opposition to obtaining the ivorce was withrawn by the wife, then upon the application to the holer of the note, it was to be elivere up to the wife or her agent.
It appears that no efence was mae, an that the ivorce was obtaine an the note elivere up, an suit brought upon it. It was in proof that the consieration an inucement for making the note, was the withrawal of opposition to the ivorce an some contribution towars the support of the wife by the son to whom the note was execute. The efence set up by the husban against the payment of this note was, that the note was illegal an voi, as being against public policy. Upon this state of facts, the court sai, “The evience in this case pretty fully establishes a case of collusion between the parties, to obtain a ivorce at the hans of the court, when both parties knew or ha goo reason to believe that no sufficient legal excuse for it existe. No such agreement, even if execute, can form a vali consieration for either a verbal or written promise. The great an principal object of the agreement mae between the parties was, to bring about a issolution of the marriage contract, an to put an en to the various uties an relations resulting from it. A contract having any such purpose, object an tenency, cannot be sustaine in law, but must be regare as against soun public policy, an consequently illegal an voi.” In this case there was no want of capacity to contract, an the contract was reuce to writing an elivere up after the ivorce was obtaine, an yet it was hel upon grouns of public policy to be voi.
This rule is firmly establishe. The object of the law is to suppress vice, an to promote the general welfare of society, an no iniviual shall be assiste by the law in enforcing a eman originating in a breaeh or violation on his part of its principles. Chitty on Con. 673. Craig vs. State of Missouri, 4 Peters Rep. 410. 2 Humph. Tenn. Rep. 1. 1 Maule & Selw. 593.
An in the enforcement of this rule neither party has any just cause of complaint. It is true that the objection comes with a ba grace from the efenant, who has reape the benefit of this agreement by obtaining the ivorce; but it is not for her sake that the objection is allowe. It is foune upon principles of public policy, which forbis that courts shoul len their ai to one who founs his cause of action upon an illegal act.
Such being my view of th'e law governing the contract upon which the action in this case is foune, I will procee to consier such of the instructions of the Circuit Court as bear upon this point, the etermination of which shoul, I apprehen, suffice to settle the whole case.
The court, in my opinion, correctly instructe the jury that the contract of a feme covert was voi, an as relate to the $300, also correctly instructe, that asubsequent express promise mae after she became a feme sole, to pay such contract, woul not bin her; but then, I think, the court improperly instructe the jury, that if efenant mae a new contract upon sufficient consieration to pay the $300 an the fee, they might fin for the plaintiff; because in the absence of any instructions as to what was a sufficient consieration, the jury might have suppose the consieration upon which the contract was originally mae was sufficient to uphol the new promise, an it was objectionable also, because there was no evience whatever of any new contract, an therefore the instructions tene to mislea the jury.
The court also erre, in my opinion, in giving the instruction aske for by the plaintiff, the substance of which was, that a promise to pay after the ivorce, an before suit brought, woul, if proven, entitle the plaintiff to recover uner the account state; because, in orer to entitle the plaintiff to recover the $300, it was not only necessary to prove an express promise within the time as set forth in the instructions, but also that sai promise was upon a present or prior legal consieration, an so far from such being the case, to have mae the instructions full, an such as woul truly have applie to the state of the evience, the court shoul have instructe the jury that a contract mae in consietion (in whole or in part,) that the efenant, in a suit in chancery for a ivorce, woul make no efence to the suit, was against public policy an voi, an that if such appeare to them to be the case in this suit, they shoul fin for the efenant, so far as-the plaintiff’s right of action was foune upon such contract.
The last instruction given appears tome still more objectionable than either of these. It was that a valuable consieration receive upon the original contract, even though the contract might be voi, was sufficient to uphol a new promise to pay, mae after the ivorce. If voi alone because of the incapacity of the efenant to contract, then the instruction might have been sustaine, but when voi also, because the consieration was illegal, as in this case, it was the very reverse of the law as applicable to the state of facts before the jury,
I conceive it unnecessary to consier the other exceptions, as from the view which I have taken of the case, the plaintiff might well have recovere uner the count for professional services, but coul not, uner any form of pleaing, recover the sum of $300, assume-by him to the attorney for the efenant.
I am of opinion that the jugment ought to be reverse, an the cause remane with instructions to grant the efenant a new trial.",legal_case,positive
