elivere the opinion of the Court.
The action in this case was brought upon the official bon of a sheriff, against himself an his securities. After setting out the bon with its conitions, the plaintiff avers that Nancy Perry-man, for whose use the suit is brought, commence her action in replevin for slaves, against William Drew in the Sebastian Circuit Court, an sue out her writ of replevin, which, whilst in full force, was place in the hans of the qualifie eputy of sai Stephens, who was then sheriff of Sebastian county, by which he was commane that if the sai Nancy Perryman shoul give security as require by law, that he cause sai slaves to be replevie an elivere to her; that sai sheriff i, whilst sai writ was in full force, by his eputy, take sai slaves by virtue thereof into his possession. An the plaintiff then alleges, as a breach of the official uty of sai sheriff that he refuse to take bon an security as require by law, from sai Nancy Perryman; but frauulently intening to injure an cheat her out of the negroes, elivere them to sai Drew.
The secon count is in all respects like the first, with this ifference, that it is allege for a breach, that sai sheriff, by his eputy, took the slaves into possession, by virtue of sai writ, but woul not, an i not take bon from the sai Nancy Perryman as require by law, an wholly faile an refuse to o so.
To this eclaration a emurrer was file, the groun of which was, that the breach assigne in each is insufficient in this, that it was not sufficient to aver that the sheriff refuse to take a bon, fyc., or that he woul not take such bon, or i not take it, but that in orer to charge the sheriff for a breach of official uty, it was necessary to aver that the sai Nancy Perryman, or some one for her, execute an tenere such bon, as require by law, to the sheriff before he execute his writ, or took the property into possession uner it. The emurrer was sustaine by the Circuit Court, an the plaintiff having ecline to amen, final jugment was renere in favor of the efenants, from which the plaintiff appeale.
There can be no oubt but that the sheriff was not only not boun to take the property into possession, without first having the security require by the statute, but it was clearly his uty to esist from any attempt to execute the writ until such bon was tenere to him. The comman in his writ is conitional: that “if the plaintiff shall give you security,” &c., “you cause the goos an chattels to be replevie an elivere to the plaintiff,” &c.
The 10th sec. Dig. ch. 146, provies that such writ shall not be execute in any case, unless the plaintiff, or some other person in his behalf, shall execute bon, &c. An the 12th sec. provies “that upon the receipt of such writ an bon before require, the sheriff shall forthwith procee to execute such writ,” &c. No one can rea these sections without being satisfie that the sheriff exceee his power an authority in taking the slaves into his possession, without having receive the bon intene for the protection an security of the efenant, an that having one soj he was uner no obligation to retain the property so taken; inee, it was his uty at once to restore it to the efenant. The statute oes not require of the sheriff to prepare a bon, nor to eman one, but before he is authorize or require to execute the writ, it is the uty of the plaintiff to make, by herself, or some one for her, a goo an sufficient bon, conitione as require by the statute with sufficient surety, an to tener it to the officer. Then shoul he refuse or neglect to perform his uty he may be hel to account by the party injure; an shoul he, as in this instance, improviently take the property into his possession without first having receive such bon, (to place the case in the most favorable attitue for the plaintiff,) it was the plaintiff’s uty to prepare an tener such bon before the sheriff coul be hel accountable for not elivering the property to her.
The language use in the breach oes not necessarily imply that a bon was tenere. A “refusal to take a bon,” or in the secon count, “that the sheriff i not an woul not take a bon,” are not equivalent to a tener an offer of a bon, prepare as require by law. The grouns of the refusal or failure to take bon are not state. The plaintiff may have offere to prepare a bon, an the sheriff have ecline to hol up the property until it was one, or for other cause, an uner the rule'that the pleaer must be suppose to have presente the facts in the most favorable aspect for his client, we must presume that ha a bon been tenere an offere to the sheriff it woul have been so state.
We think the grouns for the emurrer well taken.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
Higgs, as aministrator, sue Warner, in assumpsit, for services renere by his intestate in his lifetime, as an attorney at law, an as an orinary agent, exhibiting a bill of particulars. Warner, besies the pleas of non-assumpsit an set-off, relie upon the plea of the statute of limitations. The replication to the latter plea, although taken in short on the recor by consent, we shall consier as a special one ; otherwise, the plaintiff’s case woul be at an en at once for want of appropriate allegations of the special facts, which he complains the court below refuse to allow him to prove by the evience he offere. The evience thus offere, an which the court refuse to permit the plaintiff to prouce to the jury, was, that of “ an account” file in the Probate Court, upon which Warner obtaine an allowance against the estate of the intestate, “ for ebts” ue by Hightower, the intestate, at the time of his eath, which bore ate an were charge within three years, next before the commencement of this suit. The object avowe by the plaintiff in offering this evience, was to prove by it that a mutual open account current, existe between Plightower, in his lifetime, an the efenant, Warner, this action having been brought, as the plaintiff alleges, to recover any balance that might be foun ue upon the-proper ajustment of such account, so as to bring his case within the provision of the 17th section of the statute of limitation (Dig.p. 698.) We have chosen to say that he offere to prove this fact of such a “ mutual open account current,” by this evience alone, because it is certifie to us by the court below, that the bill of exceptions in the recor, contains all the evience that was offere an rea to the jury on the trial of the cause, an we have examine the bill of exceptions closely, an fin in it no other, either offere an refuse, or actually prouce to the jury, which in the least conuces to prove any such “ a mutual open account current.” Uner such circumstances, then, i the court ¡below err in refusing to permit the plaintiff to rea the allege account in evience ?
To etermine this question we must ascertain the meaning of the section of the limitation act, just cite, in its connection with the other provisions of the statute'. Its own wors are its best exponent, that when an action shall be “ brought to recover any balance ue upon a mutual open account current, the cause of action shall be eeme to have accrue from the time of the last item prove in such account.” It was not to exempt open accounts current from the operation of the statute, not even when Such accounts were mutual, but to fix the point of time from which the statute woul begin to run on any such latter. Accoring to very common custom in this State, store accounts for goos sol, are ue the first ay of January following the year in which they are mae. From that time the statute orinarily begins to run upon them, the customer being suppose to have purchase with reference to this common custom, an therefore agreé to the maturity of the account at that time. Otherwise the general rule might apply, which is, in general, applicable to traesmen an artificers, &c., that the statute woul run from the ay of each article elivere, or piece of work one, an the continuation of the supply, or of the work one, woul not interrupt it; an iffering essentially from a uty which requires a continuation of services to complete the one act, as the uty of an attorney to commence an manage a suit. So the time for the closing of a mutual account current, might be stipulate for between the parties, either expressly or by implication, an the statute woul run on the balance from that ay, unless absorbe in a new mutual open account, in which the balance might form the first item. But if there be no stipulation between the parties, the statute enacts that the cause ofiaction shall be eeme to accrue from the ate of the last item. It is not, however, every open account current between parties, although they may severally have cross open accounts against each'other, that is a mutual one within the meaning of the statute. Such former woul of course be matter of set-off on either sie, an by agreement coul be converte into one inivisible open mutual account current; but unless by such agreement, either express or implie, they woul remain two several open accounts current, an not one entire inivisible mutual account, for which the balance only coul be proceee for, as contemplate by the section of the statute in question.
In the one mutual account current, contemplate by the statute, matters of set-off become converte eo instanti, into payment, an the balance only is recoverable. It is one consoliate transaction linke together, however numerous the items, by an alternative or correlative subsisting ebt on the one sie inucing the creit on the other. Agreement either express or implie, is of the very essence of such a mutual account current; because it is the act of the parties, an not the act of the law. The law but recognizes their act an carries out their intention as manifeste by their act. It oes not of its own force, convert cross ealings into one inivisible mutual account, but encourages gai’ties to o so, as it oes to use their cross emans as’set-off rather than institute an inepenent cross action upon them.
When, however, the parties elect to pursue the course of ealing contemplate by the statute, it necessarily results that any one item on either sie of the one mutual account woul raw to it every other item with which it was connecte by this chain of ealing, because in the view of the statutory provision-, we are consiering lire whole is one entire transaction. It coul not, however, possibly raw to it any item with which it was not so connecte for want of the essential element of the mutual agreement of the pai'ties. Analogous to a payment mae by a party who faile to exercise his right of appropriation, when making a payment to a creitor who hols two separate emans, one barre by the statute an the other not; an the creitor, in the exercise of his orinary right of appropriation, applies it in part liquiation of the stale eman, such woul not be a part payment within the statute, so as to revive the remey for want of the essential elements of appropriation by the ebtor.
Whether or not, then, in a case like this at bar, there was such a course of mutual ealings between the parties as is contemplate by the statute, is a material fact. An as such a course of ealings is foune upon the agreement of the parties, express or implie, an oes not necessarily follow', as the consequence of the fact, that each party may have an open account current against the other, there is no groun from which to presume such course of ealing, even prima facie from proof of the existence of a cross open account current, as there woul be to presume appropriation of a partial payment, mae generally to a creitor, who hel a subsisting eman ; because, in the latter case, in the absence of all repelling circumstances, the payment coul be referre to nothing else than to this subsisting eman, whereas, in the former case the creit given, which woul constitute the cross eman, might well enough, until the contrary shoul appear by facts or circumstances, be regare as a creit at large. In the usual course of ealings, men rarely pay money unless they owe it, whilst it is one of the most orinary circumstances in common life for a man to creit one he oes not owe.
If, therefore, the court ha permitte the evience in question to have gone to the jury,’unconnecte as it was with the proof of any other fact or circumstance, in any egree conucing to prove the existence of a mutual open account current, within the meaning of the statute, between the plaintiff’s intestate an the efenant, a verict foune upon it in favor of the plaintiff woul have been so utterly without evience to sustain it, that it coul not have been permitte to stan. So that even if we might think the evience in question competent as tening one step towars the establishment of the main fact, the burthen of which was upon the plaintiff to pr-ove, its exclusion uner the state of this case, as it appears upon the recor, in no way worke the prejuice of the plaintiff..
We .think, also, that there was no error in the court below to permit the reaing in evience, to prove the set-off, the “proceeings, recovery an recor,” as it appears by the bill of exceptions was allowe : an the jugment recovere in that court against the plaintiff, as aministrator, was, we think, a goo matter of set-off uner our statute. (Dig. ch. 150, sec. 2, 3.
We fin no error in the ruling of the court, either as to the instruction given, or those refuse. The ‘ruling as to these was substantially correct.
It was suggeste by the counsel for the appellee, that there was no question upon this recor for the consieration of this court, because, although the plaintiff below excepte to the ecision of the court overruling his motion for a new trial, he faile to have a bill of exceptions seale.
In the case of Berry vs. Singer, (5 Eng. R. at p. 490) we remarke that “ we woul not go the length that is apparently inicate in Sawyer vs. Lathrop (4 Eng. R. 67), of requiring that the evience shoul, in every case, be brought upon the recor, only after the overruling of a, motion for a new trial. On the contrary, we think that if it may have been brought regularly upon the recor before, an the recor shows istinctly that all the evience was so regularly of recor; as might well be one in exceptions that might be taken by bill to the giving or refusing to give instructions to the jury in orer to show the application or misapplication of the law to the facts, there woul be no more necessity in such case of reproucing such evience in the last bill of exceptions to the overruling of the motion for a new trial than there woul be to reconstruct any other part of the re-» cor. Because the waiver which is the result of a motion for a new trial, is no mutilation of the recor, proucing thereby any necessity for its reprouction in the last bill of exceptions, but simply a waiver of the right to insist upon exceptions taken uring the trial, as mere errors in law,” unless preserve by exceptions taken to the overruling of the motion for a new trial.
In the case at bar, all the evience prouce on the trial, an that which the court woul not allow to be prouce to the jury, as well as all the instructions given an refuse, are upon the recor regularly, an so is the motion for a new trial, an the exception of the appellant to the ecision of the court overruling his motion for a new trial. A bill of exceptions coul have therefore brought nothing more upon the recor than was alreay there; an that istinguishes this case from that of For vs. Clark, (7 Eng. R. 99), an several other cases.

elivere the opinion of the court.
This was a proceeing by petition for a manamus to compel the efenant, as sheriff, to acknowlege a ee for certain lans, which the petitioner claims as purchaser at a juicial sale.
The petition is very full, as are also the recitals in the alternative writof manamus. The substance of the groun for manamus, is, that the efenant, as sheriff, offere for sale certain lots of lan, as the property of the Bank : that Johnson, at the instance of the state, an for her benefit, bi off the lan: that the State has been, an is yet reay an willing to pay the sum bi an has tenere the same to the sheriff, who refuse to receive it: that the sheriff well knowing these facts, execute an elivere to Johnson a ee to the State for sai lan: that the sheriff refuses to acknowlege such ee. An prays that he be require to o so, or to show cause why he shoul not be compelle so to o.
The efenant ecline acknowleging the ee,an for cause shows, that the lan was bi off by Johnson, as the attorney for the Bank, an that the petitioner was wholly unknown to him as purchaser: that he applie to Johnson for the sum bi which he refuse to pay; that uner the statute, upon such refusal, it became his uty to re-offer the property for sale, an that he i at the time an place, re-offer sai lan for sale, an sol it to Thomas W. Newton, to whom he execute an acknowlege a ee. Pie positively enies that either Johnson or the State or any one for them, tenere or offere the sum bi, until long after the complete consummation of the secon sale to Newton, but amits a tener by the State after that time. That his eputy took lists of the sales an mae out ees for the purchasers; that he has no recollection of having either signe or elivere a ee for the lan either to Johnson or the State. He is positive that he never intene to o so: that ees were mae out an signe, reay to be elivere when the purchase money was pai. Such ees were usually kept in a box in the clerk’s esk, an may have been taken without his knowlege.
To this response the State mae two replications: first, that the responent i not again offer sai lots for sale, at the time an place at which the first sale was mae: secon, that he i execute such ee to the State for sai lots, an that the same is his act anee. The first of these replications conclues to the country the secon, with a verification. An issues being taken upon them, they were submitte for trial to the court sitting as a jury. After hearing the evience the court foun for the efenant an renere jugment accoringly.
No exception was taken to the opinion of the court on a question of law, except as to the amissibilit}r of a certain eposition. An as there was no motion for a new trial, the correctness of the ecision of the court in excluing such evience presents the only legitimate question to be etermine.
The objection to the eposition, was that the official character of the justice, before whom the same was taken in Kentucky, was not sufficiently authenticate, in this, that what purporte to be the seal of'the Jefferson Circuit Court, was an impression upon paper, without wax or other soft tenacious substance. The court hel this objection goo an exclue the eposition. In this the court erre. In the absence of evience to the contrary, the court shoul have presume in favor of the regularity of the proceeing from the sister State. There may have been a statute there like our own, eclaring that an impression upon paper shall be a sufficient sealing: an whether this be the case or not, the later ecisions of the courts go to iscourage the objection an hol it frivolous. Pillow vs. Roberts, 13 How. U. S. S. C. Rep. 472. 7 Eng. 822.
But then the question recurs, amitting the epositions to be in other respects, unexceptionable, were they amissible uner the issue forme by the parties?
Waiving the consieration of the question whether a writ of manamus is the appropriate remey in this case, which we think extremely oubtful, an conceing the power of the court to compel the officer to perform a legal uty, still the court woul not exercise such power until a clear legal uty was shown, an it was mae to appear that the officer ha faile or refuse to perform it.
In this case the sheriff is calle upon to acknowlege a ee, which purports to have been execute by him as such to the petitioner. It is concee that the bi was mae by Johnson, an it is not shown that the sheriff was aware that the State ha any interest in the bi uuless after the secon sale of the property; but so far from this, the sheriff, in his answer uner oath, positively e nies all knowlege of the fact until after the secon sale: An this answer must be taken as true, because it is not questione by replication, nor is it isproven by other evience. The sheriff thus is cut off from all knowlege of the acts of the State. He coul not request her to pay, because she was unknown to him; an for the same reason an ability or reainess to pay by the Bank, not having been brought home to the sheriff, amounte to nothing. Thus left with Johnson, as the only known bier, who refuse to pay the sum bi, the sheriff, in obeience to the statute, re-offere the property, an sol it to a secon bier, who pai the sum bi to the sheriff. This secon sale was a revocation, uner authority of the statute, of the first bi; an no act of Johnson’s after that time coul restore him to the rights which he ha lost by refusing to pay the sum bi when calle upon.
The first replication is intene to put in issue the time when the secon sale took place. This we have hel, if true, a mere erroneous exercise of power which i not affect the valiity of the sale. Newton vs. State Bank.
An concee that the State i tener the money bi by Johnson, an claim the benefit of his bi, after the resale of the property, this coul not coaler a right on her to eman a ee for the property; because the bi uner which she claime was abanone by the refusal of the only known bier to pay the sum bi, an because the secon bier ha succeee to all his rights.
The ee subsequently foun in the possession of Johnson, bears ate eight ays after the secon sale of the property, an, if the contents of the ee are to be receive as evience, it must be taken all together, an woul show prima facie a ee signe an elivere to Johnson at that ate. If so, it was an act not warrante by law, an of course woul not be consummate by acknowlegment, by the sanction of a court. Uner the circumstances of the case, after the sale to Newton, the first bier stoo in no better situation than any one else; his bi was forfeite; there was no bi; a mere stranger ha as much right to eman a ee as he ha. But the sheriff positively enies the execution of the ee, an there is no proof of its execution except that arising from presumption: but if there was proof upon this point, it woul not avail.
It is not true, as the counsel for the State seem to suppose that the sheriff may charge himself with the sum bi an ispense with the payment of the money. This question was iscusse at length in the case of Dickson vs. Gillilan, 1 Cow Rep. 498. In that case the sheriff receive a large amount of the money an mae a ee to the junior lien creitor uner the New York statute. The first purchaser, at the expiration of the time allowe him to reeem, claime a ee, an it was orere to be mae to him, upon the groun that the sheriff ha no right to make the ee until the whole of the purchase money was pai. The policy of the law forbis that sheriffs shoul be permitte to substitute themselves as ebtors to the creitor. But even if this was permitte, it is evient that no court woul compel the sheriff to o so. Nor will the reainess of the State to pay authorize a ee after the secon sale, because the sheriff has exhauste his power an authority by a sale, an the receipt of the purchase money uner it.'
Returning theivto. the only question of law raise by the assignment of errors, the amissibility of the eposition as evience, limite in its application to the issues forme upon the replication, to the return of the sheriff on the writ of manamus, we are of opinion that ha it been amitte an ha proven every fact put in issue by the replications, that still upon the whole case, the ecision of the court was right, because the execution of the ee shoul have been before the sale to Newton an upon payment of'the money.

By an act for the relief of the securities of John Hickey, sheriff of Pope county, approve January 11th, 1851, they were allowe until the first ay of November, thereafter, to pay the amount pf his efalcation as collector of the State an county revenue, for the year 1850, an release from all forfeitures an penalties incurre, provie, they woul give bon with security, to be approve by the county juge, in vacation, for the payment of the same an with interest upon the revenue ue the State. Availing themselves of this act, they execute the bon upon which this suit was brought. The bon is mae payable to the State for the penal sum of $3,933. An, after reciting that the principals ha become security for Ilickey, as collector, that he ha mae efault, &c., that there remaine ue an unpai, from him, on account of State revenue the sum of $1042 75, an for county revenue,the sum of $'925 73, an the act passe for their relief, it was conitione to be voi, if the principals shoul well an truly pay into the State treasury, an into .the county treasury, respectively, the sums above specifie, with interest, on or before the first ay of November thereafter.
No oubt exists as to the liability of these parties, an no useful en woul be attaine by a statement of the efence sought to be interpose by one of them. The only question arising upon the recor which requires to be notice is one of pi’actice. Demurrer being sustaine to the plea interpose by one of the efenants, an he saying nothing further, an the others making efault, the cpurt assesse the amages an gave jugment for the.pbt really ue, an interest, as in other cases, where the eman is ascertaine by the instrument upon which the suit is foune. Digest, title, Practice at Law, sec. 81.
It is argue for the plaintiff in error, that this proceeing is erroneous, an we are cite to the cases of Phillips vs. The Governor, 2 Ark. 382. Aams vs. The State, 1 Eng. 490. Outlaw vs. The Governor, 3 ib. 353. Nelson vs. Hubbar, ib. 477. an McLain vs. Taylor, 4 ib. 363. In all these cases the bons sue upon were conitione for the performance of some act other than the payment of money, being either upon elivery bons or official l)ons; an tho.ugh we think, that in some of those cases the court, have ahere to the language of the statute, perhaps with unnecessary strictness, for reasons which might be given, yet we are not require now to go into an examination of them.
The statute, Digest, title, Penal Bons, provies for three istinct classes of cases, an the moe of proceeing in each is ifferently regulate. The first four sections relate to actions foune on bons conitione for the payment of a less sum of money. The sections from five to fifteen, apply to suits on bons for the breach of any conition other than for the payment of money. Sections fifteen et seq. regulate the moe of proceeing in suits on official bons ; incluing those of aministrators, guarians, &c. It is only in the last two classes of cases, where the jugment is by efault, or on emurrer, that a jury must be calle, unless waive, to enquire into the truth of the breaches assigne, an assess the amages, an when, as ecie by the cases referre to, such shoul be the form of the oath aministere to the jury, in compliance with the statute. But upon the reaing of the statute those provisions have no application to actions on bons, conitione for the payment of a less sum, an where the amount ue is ascertaine, or ascertainable by computation from the face of the instrument itself, as is the case here. In all such cases the penalty is inserte rather as an aherence to ancient form, an not because it is an essential part of the contract; an while no goo reason can be imagine for the intervention of a jury to assess the amages, the statute is not so unreasonable as to require it.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This writ of error was sue out by the plaintiffs in error, to a jugment obtaine against them in the Clark Circuit Court, after execution ha been issue an levie upon their property, an they, together with others, as securities, execute a forthcoming bon, an the same ha been forfeite, an so returne by the sheriff, an the return term ha elapse, as appears by the ates set out. These facts were set up by plea, to which a emurrer was interpose, an the question is thus presente, whether the plaintiffs in error can now maintain their writ of error to the original jugment.
The constitutionality of the forthcoming law act was consiere an etermine in the case of Rearon, Ex parte, 4 Eng. R. 450. Its unconstitutionality was again urge in the case of Ruell vs. McGruer, (6 Eng. R. 584), an the point again rule as in the former case, with the aitional intimation that, after the lapse of the term, to which the forthcoming bon was returnable, the obligors of the bon coul fin relief only in a court of equity. Afterwars, in the case of Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe, et al. 7 Eng. R. 548, it was hel, that after the forfeiture of the bon the levy was ischarge an the former jugment was satisfie. An to the same effect are the cases of Wright vs. Yell, et al. 13 Ark. 505, an Jamison vs. May, i. 608. An in the case of The Trustees of the Real Estate Bank vs. Sanefur, a. et al. ecie uring the present term, where many of the cases ecie in Kentucky, Vix*ginia, Mississippi an the Feeral Court, as well as our own, are reviewe, it is shown that the statutory jugment is consiere as having the qualities, force, effect an ignity of a jugment, obtaine in the orinaiy moe of proceeing accoring to the course of the common law, in a court of competent jurisiction, an as such may be revive by scire facias, an, in another State, is within the act of Congress of 1790, an can no more be impeache collaterally than any other jugment, (Kelly vs. Lambs, 7 B. Monroe, p. 223.) An these cases sustain the ecision of this court in the case of Kelly et al. vs. Garvin, Carson & Co., (7 Eng. R. at p. 621), where it is hel that “the statutory jugment is an extinguishment of the first jugment upon the principle that a party cannot have more than one jugment for the same subject matter at the same time.”
These consequences resulting from the voluntary act of the efenant in the execution executing the forthcoming bon uner the provisions of the statute, it is no more unreasonable that he shoul thereby be cut off from any further remey in a court of law, an be riven to a court of equity exclusively for relief, as against any other jugment at law, than making an injunction operate as a release of errors at law.
We think the matters set up in the plea sufficient, an therefore the writ of error must be quashe.

It appears that Mrs. Yiser ha several negroes, which she claime as her separate estate, but in which Yiser also claime- an interest by virtue of his marital rights 1 Mrs. Yiser, the complainant, was living in LittleRock, an Yiser, the husban, was in New Orleans. A negotiation ensue between the parties to that suit, through the meium of their respective attorneys, the result of which was, in the language of Yiser’s attorney, the only material witness to this point, that “Mrs. Yiser’s attorney agree that she woul pay me $300 for Yiser, if he woul relinquish his claim to the negroes an make no further opposition to the ivorce, which as Yiser’s attorney, I accepte.” The attorney of Viser wrote to him at New Orleans, an obtaine his ee of relinquishment of the negroes. The ee was execute to Bertran, an elivere to him, with the unerstaning that, after the ivorce, he was to convey to Mrs. Yiser. Bertran on behalf of Mrs. Yiser, gave his obligation for the payment of the $300. Subsequently, in July, 1850, Mrs. Yiser obtaine a ecree in the ivorce suit, Yiser making no opposition. The payment of the $300, was elaye for some time after the ecree, the excuse being that Mrs. Viser ha not succeee in raising the money by the sale of one of the negroes, as was intene, an which she mae some efforts to o. Accoring to my unerstaning of the recor there was evience conucing to show that Mrs. Yiser, after the ivorce, requeste Bertran to avance the money for her, until she coul raise it by a sale or mortgage of one of the negroes, or from which the jury might have inferre the fact of such request, which however, I o not regar as material. Finally, Bertran, who, not long after the ivorce, ha pai $100 aboutthe first of February, 1851, close the matter by giving his note for the remaining $200 to Yiser’s attorney, who accepte it with the unerstaning that he woul pay it whenever calle on; the witness, however, up to the time of the trial, ha not calle on Bertran for the money. There was abunant evience showing that after the ivorce Mrs. Yiser, the efenant below, acknowlege her inebteness to the plaintiff for his fee, which was agree to be settle at $100 an also for the $300 avance or assume to be pai by him for her to Yiser, an that she, on several occasions promise to pay him those sums.
On the trial in the court below, various instructions were aske for, the repetition of which in etail as given, moifie or refuse, woul be as little calculate to eluciate the ecision here as they were the issues before the jury. The points mae on behalf of the efenant below were, as gathere from the instructions aske, that as the retainer of the plaintiff an the contract or agreement about the payment of the $300, ha their inception whilst the efenant was a feme covert, such contract was absolutely voi an not bining on her; an being so, no subsequent promise by her, after she became iscovert, without some new or further consieration was shown to uphol it, woul amount to a ratification, or make such new promise bining upon her in law Seconly, that the plaintiff coul not recover for money pai, as to so much of the claim for which he ha given his note, an which i not appear to have been pai. The court below seeming to regar these propositions as law, instructe the jury on behalf of the plaintiff, that if they believe from the evience that the efenant mae a new contract, after the ivorce was grante to her, upon a sufficient consieration, to pay the $300 an the fee, they might nevertheless fin for the plaintiff uner the count upon an account state, but upon the return of the jury reporting a isagreement the court appears to have charge that, although the original contract was voi in law, yet if she mae a new promise to pay since she was ivorce, the consieration receive by her uring coverture, is sufficient to sustain such new promise, which became bining so as to authorize a recovery against her in that action.
It is certainly a rule of the common law that the contract of a marrie woman is voi. Her legal existence becomes merge in that of the husban, who, as he assumes her ebts, acquires as it were, a ominion of her estate as well as her person. She coul make no contract, the enforcement of which might eprive the husban of her society, or which coul be obligatory upon her, because of the legal presumption that it was mae uner uress. The wife may impose a liability upon the husbanby acting as his agent, by his express or implie authority, but then the contract is his. The husban being liable for her support an maintainance. the law will oblige him to furnish it, an in case of his refusal, where necessaries are furnishe to her, the law imposes the obligation an implies a promise on his part to pay for them. It woul seem that her contracts are voi by reason of incapacity to contract, an not voiable like those of an infant, to whom the law affors a protection, of which he may avail himself or waive at his pleasure.
But it has long been the establishe octrine of courts of equity, that in regar to her separate estate, the wife may have rights inepenent of, an averse to those of her husban, which will be protecte, an her liabilities in respect of such estate, enforce in that forum. When we consier the increasing tenency of legislation in this, as in other States, to emancipate the wife from the ominion of the husban, by securing to marrie women their separate property, an authority to acquire an hol it in their own names, ischarge from liabilities incurre by the husban, it behooves us to enquire whether it be the policy or esign of such legislation to exempt the separate property of the wife from liability, though it might have to be'enforce in a court of equity» upon her contracts in respect of such property. Wherever there is free agency an sufficient mental capacity, the right to contract, an the power of alienation ought to be inseparable from the ownership of property. It may inee be limite within the perio beyon which, the restraint woul become obnoxious as a perpetuity, so that where a separate estate is settle upon a woman in contemplation of marriage, the terms of the settlement an the powers conferre by it might have to be pursue in orer to enable the woman to charge her estate; yet it cannot be sai to be the policy of the law in this country, that property shoul be tie up from alienation, or absolve from the just ebts of the real owner; an the statute enabling marrie women to acquire an hol property irectly, instea of through the intervention of a trustee, is one of the many eviences of the isposition to o away with the istinction between law an equity, or rather to require courts oí law, in all cases where they are capable of afforing aequate relief, to aminister law in the spirit of equity.
Supposing in this case the money to have been fairly avance or assume to be pai, for the purpose of securing to the woman her separate property, or to quiet by way of compromise any oubtful claim of the husban to the usufruct', I apprehen it is not questione; but that the claim of the plaintiff below was such as coul have been enforce in a court of equity, an uring her coverture as against the property. The parties were living apart, an the treaty was concerning her separate property. So far from the husban being liable, he was the averse party in interest, an the wife by her agent or trustee, was contracting with him. The attorney thus acting as her agent, woul have a lien in equity upon the property for the moneys avance at her request, to secure her in the ownership or enjoyment of it. Even the court granting the ivorce, if satisfie of the fairness of the transaction, might have mae a summary orer, requiring the money so avance to be refune, an charging the payment of it upon the property ecree to the wife. Because to the .extent that a feme covert is capable of contracting, in a court of equity, she stans on the same footing with other persons, an is regare as a feme sole, uner no isability whatever. In the case of infants, who o labor uner a isability, where they avail themselves of the privilege, any court having the power, woul compel them to surrener an avantage or make restitution of property, which woul cease to be theirs, an be unjustly retaine upon the repuiation of the contract by which it was acquire.
So, a reasonable compensation for his services, to the attorney of a marrie woman, is chargeable upon her separate estate. If the suit is for ivorce, the complaint on the part of the wife, selom mae out of levity, but more often resorte to as a esperate remey for intolerable wrongs, though not to be encourage, is so far favore, that the court to which she appeals will eneavor to place her upon something like an equality with the contesting husban. If she have no separate estate the allowance to her for maintainance pening the suit, or for alimony by the ecree, are funs out of which she might be require to compensate her attorney. To eny to her the power of bining her estate for the retainer of competent professsional ai, so far from being an avantage, woul be to isarm her in a contest alreay unequal^ an require her to come into court efenceless save as an object of sympathy.
I am clearly of opinion, that if the jury believe the facts which I suppose the evience conuce to prove, (leaving out of view another feature in the cause to be presently notice,) the plaintiff below was entitle to recover upon the express promise of the efenant after she became iscovert, without any new or further consieration for the promise being mae to appear: an I rest my opinion istinctly upon the groun that the promise was bining, not by force of any mere moral obligation resting upon her, but because the contract or agreement mae uring coverture, whereby she receive an avantage, an the plaintiff below suffere a isavantage, was of such a nature as to be vali an bining upon her estate as a feme covert an a sufficient consieration to uphol her promise as a feme sole.
I o not unerstan the case of Lee vs. Muggrige, 5 Taun. 36, an the cases which followe it, to have been oubte or overrule, except to the extent of the loose expressions containe in that case, to the effect that any moral obligation is a sufficient consieration to uphol an express promise. The law is now well settle the other way, an without tracing the course of the ecisions, a correct exposition of it is containe in the more recent cases of Eastwoo vs. Kenyon, 11 A. & Ellis 438, in Englan, an Greer vs. Archer, 2 Barbour Sup. Ct. Rep. 420, among many ecie in this country. Strictly speaking, á moral, istinguishe from a legal obligation, an where there never was anything more than a moral obligation, is never a sufficient consieration to uphol an express promise. Many instances may be imagine where a person of refine feelings an cultivate min woul hol himself, or consier another boun by strong obligations of gratitue, where voluntary compensation might well be mae, but where no promise for future compensation coul raise the uty to the slanar of a legal obligation. Such uties belong to that class of imperfect obligations, bining in conscience, but whiclffihejlaw'fioes nofrecognize an will not enforce, because it cannot appreciate the consieration, or estimate the amages for a breach of uty. Inee, no greater change in the fabric of the common law coul well be conceive, than for the courts to put moral obligations upon a footing of equality with valuable consierations to uphol contracts. Besies the vague an inefinite nature of such obligations, the liability to unjust preferences of them over creitors whom the law has recognize as more meritorious, will suffice without any further conjecture, to illustrate the startling consequences that woul result from such a change. The rule euce from a review of the cases containe in the note, so often cite an approve, to Wennall vs. Abney, 3 Bos. & Pul. 249, exclues the iea of a mere moral obligation as a sufficient consieration to support a promise, by confining its operation to those cases where there was a preceent goo consieration to support an express promise, or from which the law woul imply a promise, which might have been, or coul yet be enforce, but for the operation of some'positiverule of law, as for instance, a ebt once vali an subsisting, but ischarge in bankruptcy, or barre by limitation, or the contract, of an infant which he may confirm at majority.
It may somtimes be ifficult to istinguish, between what are legal an what are moral obligations, but when ascertaine, the istinction has no peculiar application to the contracts of marrie women, or their moral obligation for benefits conferre. It is applicable alike to all persons who have full capacity to contract. If the agreement of a feme covert to contract is vali, so as to be obligatory in equity, her promise after she becomes is-covert nee not epen upon the moral obligation; nor is the promise of one, not uner a isability, aie by any moral obligation where there never was a preceent goo consieration.
. It is true the original contract of the efenant below, while a feme covert, coul not have been enforce against her in an action at law; but if I am right in concluing that it was one for her benefit, which equity woul sanction an enforce in her favor an against her estate, it woul seem to be a technical an unfoune istinction to hol that there was no consieration to uphol her subsequent promise, because the original contract coul not have been enforce at law. I take it to be the spirit of the rule given in the note to the case in 3 Bos. Sf Pul., that wherever the promisee ha a right, upon a goo consieration, of which he might have availe himself, at law or in equity, against the promisor, an whether in the prosecution or efence of a suit, such right, though it has become unavailing, is a sufficient consieration to uphol a promise to continue or renew the former liability. The case of Littlefiel vs. Shee, 2 Barn. & Aol. 811, where the plaintiff, a butcher, ha supplie the efenant, when a marrie woman, with meat for her own use, while her husban was abroa, an after his eath she promise payment, oes ilot militate against the position that the efenant may be liable upon her promise in this case, because there, supposing the eclaration to have been free from any objection, the court must have hel that if anyboy was liable to the plaintiff it was the husban, it being in law his ebt an not that of the wife, for whose subsequent promise there coul have been no consieration beyon the suppose moral' obligation. So, in the case of Watkins vs. Halstea, 2 Saun. Sup. Ct. Rep. 311, where goos were furnishe to a marrie woman living apart from her husban, an having a separate property hel for her by a trustee, an after being ivorce from her husban, she promise to pay for the goos, the court say, “It is not pretene that inepenently of the express promise of the appellant, after she obtaine her ecree of ivorce, this action coul be sustaine. If when the ebt was contracte, when the goos were elivere any person was liable it was the husban. We see nothing in the case to exempt him from liability. The appellant was then a feme covert an clearly not liable. Her promise to pay was mae after she was ivorce, an if that promise is not supporte by aequate consieration, the action must fail.” Assuming therefore, at the outset, that the original promise was not bining on the wife, an never coul have been enforce against her, the court go into an examination of the cases an unavoiably conclue that the moral obligation resting upon her was not sufficient to support her subsequent promise.
The other point of law raise by the instructions, is settle by the ecision of this court in Neale vs. Newlan, 4 Ark. 506. See also Logan vs. Williamson, 3 Ark. 216. R. E. Bank vs. Rawon et al., 5 Ark. 569, an Joran vs. Aams. 2 Eng. 348, that a negotiable note given an accepte in payment of a ebt of a thir person, becomes an extinguishment of it, an proof of this is sufficient evience to support an action against the ebtor for money pai. An upon so much of the case, as it come up on a motion for new trial, I woul see no cause to isturb the verict.
But the efenant below, in her motion for new trial, besies renewing the legal exceptions I have been consiering, an also urging certain matters of surprise an aitional evience, which are lai wholly out of view as insufficient, move for anew trial upon the groun, then for the first time presente to the court, that the original consieration for her liability to the plaintiff was illegal an immoral, in this, that the money was avance to inuce Viser, the husban, to withraw his opposition to her suit for ivorce, which if it be true, woul be a clear case of collusion, in violation of the spirit of the statute concerning ivorces, an contrary to public policy. An after some hesitation, because the efenant, moving for a new trial, seems to stan in the attitue of one, who shoul come into equity with clean hans, I thinlc the court below shoul have grante a new trial upon this groun — not for any merit in the efenant, much less a emerit in the plaintiff who may have been acting for what he conceive to be the best interest of his client; not that I can assume the fact to be as claime, because this as a question of fact was*-' not put to the jury or passe on by them; but because there was evience conucing to show that the money was pai to inuce Viser to make no further opposition to the ivorce, as well as to relinquish his claim to the negroes. An there being such evience, it was not only the right but th.e uty of the court to have interpose of its own motion, an put it to the jury to say whether this taint entere into an forme any part of the consieration, for which the three hunre ollars were pai, an to have charge them that if they so foun, the plaintiff as to so much of his eman, coul not recover. Because, otherwise, if both parties to an immoral contract, were content not to raise such objection, the courts might be compelle to ajuicate their allege rights uner contracts of that escription, which the law woul neither enforce nor rescin. It requires no enlarge inquiry into the policy of the statute concerning ivorces, to lea to the conclusion, that if money is avance or agree to be pai in consieration that a party to a suit for a ivorce will withraw opposition, it amounts to collusion. The statute requires, in suits for ivorce, at least a ecent show of opposition, an where that is wanting, the courts shoul look to it with increase vigilance, that the complainant’s allegations are fully sustaine by evience. If the money was avance for the purpose in whole or in part of compouning the suit, it coul not be recovere back from the party to whom it was pai, an the illegal taint woul enter into an vitiate any new promise to refun mae by the party, on whose behalf it was avance.
For this groun alone, an not upon any other containe in the motion, I think a new trial shoul have been grante.
Mr. Justice Scott.
None of the reasons for the motion for a new trial are tenable, as I think, except that which sets up, that in the groun of liability presente by the plaintiff below there was such gross illegality as to be justly offensive to goo morals an soun public policy, in this, that a part of that, for which he proceee, was for money avance to inuce Yiser, the husban, not only to relinquish his claim to the negroes in ispute, but to withhol his opposition to the suit of the wife for a ivorce. The former might well be uphel, because of the law’s high favor of compromises] but its abhorrence of collusion in a suit for ivorce, is so great, that relief shoul be at once given on such groun, even at the application of a particeps .criminis. It oes not give relief, however, in such case to the party, but to the public through the party, for the promotion of ecency an public morals. An it will be affore as well where there may be just emans unite with one so tainte, as where the latter may be the sole founation of the suit; because it is the public interest alone that the law thus seeks to subserve; an it was the party’s own folly to mix a rotten eman with a soun one.
Nor shoul this groun of interposition by the court be any the less regare, because it was not moote uring the trial in chief. So far from this, it is the bounen uty of the courts to guar the public morals of the country to the full extent of their powers, an for this purpose to interpose of their own motion for their vinication on all proper occasions. Nor oes any matter touching public ecency an soun morals, an the very pith of the Jeaven of social life, so much eserve the vigilance of the courts as this very matter of ivorce. The marital tie, although a civil .contract in the eye of the law, iffers from all other civil contracts in one essential particular. The parties can never annul it by means either irect or inirect. TIence the inexible rule of law, that the confessions of either party are wholly incompetent as evience. Nor oes our statute, which irects that “like pi'ocess an proceeings shall be ha in” ivorce cases (Dig. ch. 58 p. 462, sec. 3,) “as are ha in other cases on the equity sie of the court,” or in any other of its irections, or provisions, in any way alter or moify this vital rule of evience touching the issolution of the marital tie. Parties by their mutual consent, if of proper age an capacity to receive the sanction of the law, may make the marriage tie, but they can never break it accoring to the rul es of law an the soun morals upon which itrests, by any express, confessions, much less by those implie by a efault of answer to a bill for ivorce. A contrary rule, it woul seem, coul only be certifie to the courts by express legislation, pn even then, so great woul be the inevitable abuses in its aministration, that it might not be totally unworthy of consieration whether it coul have operation among men in harmony with the paramount laws of Go.
But for this groun of the motion for a new trial, it might well enough have been refuse, as it was, because leaving out of view this matter of illegality, in which the public was thus concerne, an which the evience seems to show to exist in fact, the verict an jugment were well enough sustaine. The compromise settle the property as the separate property of the wife, an certainly quoa this, she was a feme sole in a court of equity, an liable not only for her contracts concerning it, but also for others that touche her personal benefit, if not contrary to law; an it was not unlawful for her to sue for a ivorce an employ counsel to sustain her suit.
I concur with my brother juges in awaring a new trial.
Mr. Justice Walker.
This was an action of assumpsit brought by Bertran against-Mrs. Viser. The efenant pleae the general issue, an the-case was trie by a jury, who foun a yerict for the plaintiffiThe efenant file her motion for a new trial, setting out various causes for the same, amongst which it may only be necessary to enumerate those which affirm that the court erre in the-' instructions given, an in refusing to give instructions aske by the efenant an that the verict was contrary to the evience, to law, an to the instructions of the court. The motion for a' new trial was overrule an the efenant excepte, setting out the evience, an has brought the case here by writ of error.
The plaintiff’s action is foune upon two items of charge, the nature of which we will procee to consier. The first is for professional services renere by the plaintiff in obtaining a ivorce for her. These services were contracte for an renere whilst the efenant was a feme covert, an therefore the contract as to her was voi. The plaintiff amits this, but relies upon an express promise to pay after the ivorce, upon the groun that, although no legal obligation reste upon her to pay, that her moral obligation was a sufficient consieration for such, express promise. If this contract ha been voiable instea of voi (as if mae with an infant) the question woul have been more free from oubt. The point of ifficulty is whether, if no legal obligation, ever existe, a moral obligation can be sai to exist, such as will be a sufficient consieration to uphol an express promise to pay.
Upon examination of the authorities I think it may be sai that there must be such legal obligation or a legal an sufficient consieration, such as might have been enforce through the meium of an implie promise, ha it not been suspene by the incapacity of the feme covert to contract. Kent, in his Commentaries, part 5, vol. 2, p. 258, says, “A sufficient legal obligation to o a thing is a sufficient consieration for a promise to o it; but it has been an unsettle point, whether a mere moral obligation be of itself a sufficient consieration for a promise, except in those cases in which a prior legal obligation or consieration ha once existe. The weight of authority is that it is not sufficient.”
An it is lai own by Chitty in his work on Contracts, page 47, “That an express promise can only revive a preceent goo consieration which might have been enforce at law through the meium of an implie promise, ha it not been suspene by some positive rule of law, but can give no original cause of action, if the obligation on which it is foune never coul have been enforce at law, though not barre by any legal maxim or statute provision.” The same rule is lai own in 3 Bosanquet & Puller 244. Smith vs. Vare, 13 John. R. 258.
In the case now uner consieration, although no legal obligation existe uner which the efenant coul have been compelle to pay for the professional services, still such services were a legal consieration which but for the rule of law that makes voi the contract of a feme covert, a recovery might have been ha upon an implie assumpsit, an consequently furnishe a sufficient consieration to uphol an express promise mae after the ivorce to pay for them. Nor was it necessary in orer to make the express promise bining upon the efenant, to prove affirmatively that she knew at the time the express promise was mae, that she was not boun in law by her former contract. This, in the absence of evience to the contrary must be presume.
As regars the other item of charge, the $300, the facts are these. The complainant sue her husban for a ivorce, an also set up claim to several slaves, as her separate property. Defenant employe counsel an was preparing to efen, contesting the complainant’s title to the slaves; but upon a conference between the complainant an the efenant, through their respective counsel, it was propose that complainant woul pay efenant $300, if he woul relinquish his claim to the negroes, an make no further opposition to the ivorce, which terms were agree to, an at the request of complainant, the plaintiff in this suit an his associate counsel entere into an obligation to the attorney for the husban, bining themselves to pay him the sum of $300. This contract was entere into whilst the efenant in the present action was a feme covert. The relinquishment was procure from the husban by his attorney an elivere to the plaintiff, Bertran, who still (so far as appears from the evience) retains the same. No efence was mae to the suit for a ivorce, an after it was obtaine, the efenant repeately promise to pay the sum so secure by plaintiff an his associate counsel, Lincoln. But there is no proof that efenant requeste plaintiff to pay sai sum after she was ivorce. The payment of the $100, an the note for $200 seems to have been an arrangement between the plaintiff an the attorney for the husban without special irections or request from efenant, inee she at one time, expresse to Webb, a witness, fears that her attorneys ha not acte fairly with her, an ha in fact not pai the sum aforesai. The testimony of the other witnesses, it is true, acquits the plaintiff of all unfairness, but so far as the latter arrangement of payment is concerne, this goes to show that .representions ha been mae to her about the payment of the money, with regar to the truth of which she was not satisfie. In view of the whole of the evience, there can be no oubt of a full recognition of the contract mae whilst efenant was a feme covert, an of her promise to pay it after the ivorce; but there is no evience of any new contract mae after that time, nor oes it appear from a careful review of the whole of the evience, that Bertran, the plaintiff, took in the obligation of himself an Lincoln, an pai the f 100, an gave his note for the balance at the instance of the efenant or with her consent.
Waiving then the consieration of the question, as to whether .the promise to pay the $200, coul be given in evience uner the counts in the eclaration, the main question is, that conceing the money to have been pai either before or since the ivorce was obtaine, was this a preceent goo consieration which might have been enforce at law, through the meium of an implie promise, ha it not been suspene by that rule of law which enies the valiity of the wife’s contracts mae uring coverture.
The item of charge for professional services was alone encumbere with this positive rule of law. The subject matter of the contract was not against the law, or the policy of the law. But with regar to this latter item, the $300, a part at least of the consieration an inucement to the contract was, that the husban shoul offer no efence to the suit fora ivorce. This was clearly against the policy of the statute in regar to ivorces, uner the provisions of which, the particular grouns of complaint must be set forth in the bill an sworn to. An the complainant is also require to swear that the complaint is not mae through levity, or by collusion, fear or restraint, between complainant an efenant, for the mere purpose of being separate from each other, but in sincerity an in truth, for the causes in the bill set forth.
The contract of marriage, unlike orinary contracts of business, is one which the public, as well as the iniviuals contracting, is intereste in preserving unbroken, unless for such causes as are specially set forth in the statute, an these causes must in fact exist, an must be shown to exist by evience. No amissions of the efenant, whether by answer or by failure to answer, will supersee the necessity of proof of the truth of the allegations in the bill. An every contract not to efen or withhol evience which, if prouce, woul ten to isprove the allegations in the bill, is clearly in violation of the spirit of the statute, an shoul not be enforce.
This question was istinctly presente in the case of Sayles vs. Sayles, 1 Foster’s N. H. Rep. 312, in which the valiity of a contract not to efen against a suit for ivorce came up: an there no question arose as to the capacity of the parties to contract, because the husban execute the note, an the suit for ivorce was by him, not the wife, as in this case, so that the whole question turne upon the valiity of the contract, in reference to the subject matter about which it was mae. There the husban file his bill for a ivorce; pening the suit, conversations were hel between the counsel of the respective parties which resulte in an agreement by which the complainant execute a note for $400, payable to the son of the wife, an elivere to a thir person, with the unerstaning that if the complainant succeee in obtaining a ivorce, an if opposition to obtaining the ivorce was withrawn by the wife, then upon the application to the holer of the note, it was to be elivere up to the wife or her agent.
It appears that no efence was mae, an that the ivorce was obtaine an the note elivere up, an suit brought upon it. It was in proof that the consieration an inucement for making the note, was the withrawal of opposition to the ivorce an some contribution towars the support of the wife by the son to whom the note was execute. The efence set up by the husban against the payment of this note was, that the note was illegal an voi, as being against public policy. Upon this state of facts, the court sai, “The evience in this case pretty fully establishes a case of collusion between the parties, to obtain a ivorce at the hans of the court, when both parties knew or ha goo reason to believe that no sufficient legal excuse for it existe. No such agreement, even if execute, can form a vali consieration for either a verbal or written promise. The great an principal object of the agreement mae between the parties was, to bring about a issolution of the marriage contract, an to put an en to the various uties an relations resulting from it. A contract having any such purpose, object an tenency, cannot be sustaine in law, but must be regare as against soun public policy, an consequently illegal an voi.” In this case there was no want of capacity to contract, an the contract was reuce to writing an elivere up after the ivorce was obtaine, an yet it was hel upon grouns of public policy to be voi.
This rule is firmly establishe. The object of the law is to suppress vice, an to promote the general welfare of society, an no iniviual shall be assiste by the law in enforcing a eman originating in a breaeh or violation on his part of its principles. Chitty on Con. 673. Craig vs. State of Missouri, 4 Peters Rep. 410. 2 Humph. Tenn. Rep. 1. 1 Maule & Selw. 593.
An in the enforcement of this rule neither party has any just cause of complaint. It is true that the objection comes with a ba grace from the efenant, who has reape the benefit of this agreement by obtaining the ivorce; but it is not for her sake that the objection is allowe. It is foune upon principles of public policy, which forbis that courts shoul len their ai to one who founs his cause of action upon an illegal act.
Such being my view of th'e law governing the contract upon which the action in this case is foune, I will procee to consier such of the instructions of the Circuit Court as bear upon this point, the etermination of which shoul, I apprehen, suffice to settle the whole case.
The court, in my opinion, correctly instructe the jury that the contract of a feme covert was voi, an as relate to the $300, also correctly instructe, that asubsequent express promise mae after she became a feme sole, to pay such contract, woul not bin her; but then, I think, the court improperly instructe the jury, that if efenant mae a new contract upon sufficient consieration to pay the $300 an the fee, they might fin for the plaintiff; because in the absence of any instructions as to what was a sufficient consieration, the jury might have suppose the consieration upon which the contract was originally mae was sufficient to uphol the new promise, an it was objectionable also, because there was no evience whatever of any new contract, an therefore the instructions tene to mislea the jury.
The court also erre, in my opinion, in giving the instruction aske for by the plaintiff, the substance of which was, that a promise to pay after the ivorce, an before suit brought, woul, if proven, entitle the plaintiff to recover uner the account state; because, in orer to entitle the plaintiff to recover the $300, it was not only necessary to prove an express promise within the time as set forth in the instructions, but also that sai promise was upon a present or prior legal consieration, an so far from such being the case, to have mae the instructions full, an such as woul truly have applie to the state of the evience, the court shoul have instructe the jury that a contract mae in consietion (in whole or in part,) that the efenant, in a suit in chancery for a ivorce, woul make no efence to the suit, was against public policy an voi, an that if such appeare to them to be the case in this suit, they shoul fin for the efenant, so far as-the plaintiff’s right of action was foune upon such contract.
The last instruction given appears tome still more objectionable than either of these. It was that a valuable consieration receive upon the original contract, even though the contract might be voi, was sufficient to uphol a new promise to pay, mae after the ivorce. If voi alone because of the incapacity of the efenant to contract, then the instruction might have been sustaine, but when voi also, because the consieration was illegal, as in this case, it was the very reverse of the law as applicable to the state of facts before the jury,
I conceive it unnecessary to consier the other exceptions, as from the view which I have taken of the case, the plaintiff might well have recovere uner the count for professional services, but coul not, uner any form of pleaing, recover the sum of $300, assume-by him to the attorney for the efenant.
I am of opinion that the jugment ought to be reverse, an the cause remane with instructions to grant the efenant a new trial.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This bill was file by Conway, to enjoin proceeings on a jugment at law, obtaine by Ellison against him in the State of Tennessee, on the 24th January, 1846, upon personal service of process. After stating that he ha been appointe guarian of George M. Gray, who was a brother-law of the efenant, ha sent him to Nashville, to perfect an complete his eucation, an pai all the expenses an charges attening the same, which were allowe him in the settlement of his accounts, ha cease to be guarian on the 13th of January, 1842, on the war’s reaching the age of twenty-one, an ha turne over to the war his property, the complainant allege, in substance, that he never ha any transactions with, nor i he ever owe Ellison anything iniviually; that in 1840 the efenant wrote one or two letters to the complainant, claiming compensation for the boar of George M. Gray, to the amount of about forty ollars, to which the complainant replie by letter, that he expecte to receive a large sum of money for the use of his war, an if the account was sent uly probate, he woul pay it out of his own funs: that in 1843 Ellison visite Hempstea county, where complainant resie, an saw him on many occasions, but that no claim was prefere or mentione by Ellison, an complainant suppose that it ha been ajuste by Gray, an gave himself no concern about it; that in October, 1845, the complainant visite Nashville, Tennessee, an was there serve with a writ requiring him to answer sai Ellison to a plea of ebt, an in which writ the complainant was escribe to be “Guarian of George M. Gray;” that he consulte an eminent lawyer in Nashville, an truly represente to him all the material facts of the case, who assure the complainant that the action coul not be maintaine nor a recovery ha, without proof that he was still guarian of Gray, an the attorney plege himself to atten to an efen the action; an see that the necessary proof was auce to efeat it, in the event there shoul be no failure of evience on the part of the plaintiff; that knowing that the claim was unfoune an never coul be proven, an relying on his attorney to efeat the suit at the trial, he gave no further attention to it, an hear nothing more from it until 1849, when an action was brought on the jugment, which appeare to have been renere for $174 ebt, an $53 amages an costs; that his attorney, “either by frau an collusion with sai Ellison, or from some unaccountable conuct,” faile to appear an efen the suit as he ha promise to o, an jugment was renere against the complainant by efault, without the intervention of a jury, or the prouction of any evience whatever to establish the eman.
The efenant answere, enying the material allegations’™ the bill, an claime the benefit of the jugment, an also set up in the answer that the efence, if available, shoul have been mae at law, an that a court of equity ha no jurisiction to grant the relief praye for in the bill.
1. The jugment of a court of another State can only be impeache for want of jurisiction over the subject matter or person, or on the groun of frau, an hence it is not competent for the court, where the remey is sought, to inquire into mere irregularities, such as whether jugment was pronounce with or without a jury; or evience was or was not auce, or matters of a like nature; because it must be manifest, that to tolerate such objections, woul be in effect to exercise a revisory power over the jugment in a collateral proceeing, an thus estroy its valiity; The jugment itself closes the oor to such efects, an hence if the impute irregularities an errors in the bill ha been prove, still they coul have no effect whatever in the ecision of this cause, 2 Peters 162. 10 Peters 468, 475. 2 McLean 59.
There is but one allegation which approaches towars laying a founation for relief, an that is a general one, insinuating frau an collusion between the attorney an Ellison, to obtain the jugment. It is not a irect charge of frau, since it was mae alternatively, an couple with an allegation of “unaccountable conuct” in the attorney, the meaning of which is not efine, nor are we informe of what precise acts it consiste, or by what stanar to be measure.
As frau is never to be presume, it follows that, where it is relie as a groun of relief, the facts an circumstances constituting the frau, must be state in the bill with istinctness an precision, so that an issue will be forme which may apprize both parties of proof proper to be taken. Kenney vs. Kenney, 2 Ala. 571. Penerton vs. Galloway, 9 Ham. 178. Pleaings in equity an at law are esigne to apprize parties an the court of the material facts on which the asserte right epens, an to invoke attention to the points to which testimony shoul be irecte, Crockett vs. Lee, 7 Wheat. 527. Necessity imposes it as a uty, an justice requires that the ecree in all cases shoul conform to the allegations an proofs, an inee, the relaxation of these rules to any great extent woul be prouctive of confusion, uncertainty an injustice. This octrine was in effect recognize in Blakeney vs. Ferguson, 3 Eng. 276, an is not only entirely conformable to reason, but amply supporte by the best authorities. James vs. McKennon, 6 John. 559, 564. Cresset vs. Milton, 1 Ves.jr. 449. 3 Wen. 653.
Whatever is essential to the rights of the complainant an within his knowlege ought to be allege with such egree of certainty, as to give the efenant full information of the case he is calle on to answer; or on his failure to appear an efen, that the court may ecree on the face of the bill in favor of the Complainant, 1 Daniell’s Ch. Pr. 411, 421. Story Eq. Pl. 28. The same precision of statement is neither require or attainable in equity as in pleaings at law, but the meaning of the rule is, that the substantial grouns of relief must be state with such general certainty an precision, as to apprize the efenant of the tz’ue zzature of the case, an the points to which testiznony shoul be applie; an justice emans that in all cases, the rule shoul be observe. It is plain that the allegation in the bill lacks the requisite certainty in the matter of the frau, but even if it was sufficient, no proof whatever was taken or ofiere, either express or circumstantial, to sustain it; nor was it even prove that counsel ha been l’etaine at all. There can be no imputation more sezious or grievous against an attorney than that by frau or collusion with his aversaiy, he suffere azi unjust jugment to be obtaine against his client, an it shoul not only be istinctly charge an cleai'ly pi-ove, but one so regarless of the uties an forgetful of the obligations of a high an honorable profession shoul be promptly stricken from its rolls.
If the complainant was zzot inebte to the efenazzt, it was a strictly legal efezzce, an shoul have been mae in the suit at law in Tennessee. Dewees vs. Richarson, 1 A. K. Marsh. 313. He was boun to make it at law, an coul have no relief in equity unless he shows that he was prevente from oing so, by accient, surprise or mistake, or by the frau of the opposite party, without his own fault or negligence. Anrews vs. Fenter, 1 Ark. 186. Hempstea vs. Watkins, 1 Eng. 356. Lansing vs. Ey, 1 Johns. Ch. R. 51. Duncan vs. Lyon, 3 Johns. Ch. R. 351. Foster vs. Woo, 6 Johns. Ch. R. 89. This rule has. been too often recognize an enforce in this court to nee further emonstration. It is true that where courts of law an equity have concurrent jurisiction, a party may make his election as to the tribunal in which he will bring forwar his efence. If he prefers submitting it to a court of chancery, he must neither make nor attempt a efence at law; because the tribunal to which he first submits himself, must of necessity etermine the matter conclusively between the parties. Bently vs. Dillar, 1 Eng 84 Hempstea vs. Watkins, 1 Eng. 356. An this octiine waB re* affirme in Arrington vs. Washington, ecie at July term 1853, by this court, an in which case it was hel that the inquiry in such cases was, not what kin of efence was mae, but whether a efence atlaw was attempte at all, an if so he was preclue from coming into chancery. The rule oes not apply, where the efence offere is of an equitable nature, an coul notbe mae at law, because in that case there is but one tribunal competent to affor relief. Hawkins vs. Depreist, 4 Munf. 469. Sauners vs. Marshall, 4 Hen. & Munf. 459. Spencer vs. Wilson, 4 Munf. 130. Fish vs. Lane, 2 Hayw. 342.
An it is quite immaterial whether the party efens at law or not; for in either event, he is not barre from asserting his right in equity, as to his eqitable efence, by which expression is intene a efence not available at law in any contingency whatever. But the efence set forth in the bill was not of that character. It was purely legal, unaccompanie by equitable circumstances, an no sufficient excuse has been state to show why it was not mae in the suit in Tennessee. The complainant was not ignorant of the facts on which the efence reste, for he avers that he communicate them fully to his counsel, an was informe by the latter that the action coul notbe maintaine, an he chose to rest easy on that avice. No accient is pretene to have prevente it, an frau an collusion are istinctly enie an not prove. The claim for relief is narrowe own to the common case of a person, who having a strict legal efence, neglects to make it at law, an thus forever loses its benefit. Even if a retainer ha been prove an gross' negligence in the counsel, unaccompanie by frau, or unfairness, still to attempt to relieve from its consequences woul be to venture into a vast ocean of litigation without chart or compass to guie us. It woul, in fact, amount to an extension of privileges to one class of persons, which are enie to others, thus estroying that equality which is the boast of a court of equity, an shoul never be lost sight of in its ecisions an ecrees.
The injure party, however, is not without reress; since the attorney is responsible in a civil action for amages, arising from negligence an inattention to the interests of the client. Denton vs. Noyes, 7 Johns. 297.
It was sai correctly an pertinently, in Barrow vs. Jones, 1 J. J. Marsh. 470, that “ courts cannot give reress against the other party tQ the suit, but it? must be sought in a new action. An in Lawson vs. Bettison, 7 Eng. 417, this court hel that where a party employe an attorney at law, either to prosecute or efen his suit in the courts of the country, he presents him to the opposite party an to the worl as his accreite agent, an as such he must be conclue by his acts or omissions where no frau or unfairness is mae to appear. The bill, taking every statement on that subject to be true, fails to show ue iligence on the part of the complainant; but, on the contrary, evinces that he gave himself no concern about the suit, an never attempte to furnish evience, if any existe, to prevent a recovery, an certainly that was not the uty of the attorney. It is a carinal rule in equity, commene by its goo sense, that no man can be relieve from the consequence of negligence, carelessness or inattention; because to o that woul be to make litigation enless, rob the vigilant of their avantages, an overwhelm courts of equity by the pressing multitue of slothful suitors. In their organization courts of equity are properly an necessarily veste with a large iscretion, but still it is a iscretion epening on establishe ari well efine principles, an in every view of the subject, it is clear that the complainant was not entitle to the relief praye for in his bill, an the same shoul have been ismisse.
Unless in ai of a suit at law, no injunction shoul be grante where the applicant for it oes not submit to a jugment at law, or as it is technically terme — confesses jugment. Matthews vs. Douglass, Cooke 136. Nelson vs Owen, 3 Ireell Ch R. 178. The reason is, that if he oes not succee in equity, he might still go on an efen at law, prosecute a writ of error, or take an appeal an thus unreasonably elay his aversary in the obtainment of his rights. 1 Ma. Ch. 132, 1 Vernon 120. No person can be allowe to litigate at law an in chancery at the same time, as to the same subject matter, an an election to resort to the latter forum, lias the effect of closing the oor of the former to him, so far that if he fails his aversary may, without further litigation, avail himself of his recovery at law by means of an execution.
When an action has been commence, Lor Roslyn sai a plaintiff must be permitte to go on to trial an jugment, an that the injunction only staye execution. Franco vs. Franco, 2 Cox 420. Een lays own this rule, that “the plaintiff may procee so far as to be able to take out execution the instant that the injunction is issolve.” Een on Injunctions 97. Therefore after an interlocutory jugment, as by efault or a emurrer, the plaintiff at law may go on to ascertain his amages, 3 P. Wms. 147. Daniell aopting the language of Een, says that after the commencement of a suit at law, the plaintiff may procee so far that he may be in a situation immeiately on the issolution of the injunction, to take out execution. 3 Daniell's Ch. Pr. 1819. In Warwick vs. Norvale, 1 Leigh 96, it was expressly ecie that an injunction can only be grante on conition that the efenant confesses jugment at law, an if a party refuses to submit to such jugment, the injunction will be enie, or if one has been grante it may for such cause be issolve. An this is not a rule of practice to be change or moifie at pleasure, or to be enforce or not, as the chancellor shall think fit ¿ but it is one resting on ancient an well efine principles of justice an equity, an having in view the suppression of litigation an the preservation of the just rights of the averse party. Ham vs. Schuyler, 2 Johns. Ch. R. 140.
As far as the recor inicates in this case, the proceeings at law seem to have been arreste at the commencement, an no jugment to have been confesse at law, an if that is the fact the efenant is now entitle to jugment for his eman. If jugment was renere he is entitle to execute it without further elay.
The ecree must be reverse an the cause remane with irections to issolve the injuction with amages accoring to the statute, that the efenant be allowe to procee at law, an the bill be ismisse at the costs of the complainant.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This is an application for an appeal uner the provisions of our statute, (Dig. ch. 28, p. 244, an 135), an the question presente, is whether or not, uner the provision of the 21st section of our statute of ower; (Dig. ch. 59, p. 448), when the husban ies, leaving a wiow an no chilren, she takes one-half of the real estate, an one-half of the slaves of which he ie seize, absolutely an in her own right, or only a ower estate in them, for the fall term of her natural life; an vve think it perfectly clear, when this section is consiere in connexion with the other provisions of the ower law, that she takes only a ower interest an estate for life.
It is manifest that if she takes the slaves, absolutely an in her own right, she takes the real estate in the same way, an this woul be in conflict with the policy of our statute of escents, of preserving the inheritance in the bloo of the first purchaser, subject to ower in the common law sense of that term; as to the uration of the estate. It is only when there are no kinre, either paternal or maternal, capable of inheriting, an next before it escheats, that real estate escens from the husban to the wife, or vice versa, (Dig. ch. 56, sec. 7). It woul be easy to show, by enlarging upon this view of the subject, that if the wiow coul take one-half of the lan absolutely, an not a oWer -estate in it for life only, the Legislature ha really achieve much less than half they eviently esigne by the system of escents fthey set on foot.

elivere the opinion of the Court.,
This is an action of replevin brought by the appellees against the appellants, for the wrongful taking of slaves. The efenants file two pleas, non cepit an property in themselves, as the executors of the last will an testament of Freerick Notrebe, ecease. By written consent an agreement, an agree statement of the facts was submitte to the court as a special verict.
The facts or special verict is substantially this: John Baptiste Bellette an his wife, Elizabeth Bellette resie with, or in the immeiate vicinity of Freerick Notrebe, (who ha marrie their aughter,) for twenty-five years, an uring that time, an prior to the 17th of July, 1835, the sai John Baptiste ha renere services to sai Freerick, in the management of his business. In consieration of which an one ollar, on the ay last aforesai, the sai Freerick, by ee in fee simple, conveye to the sai John Baptiste, two lots of lan in the village of Arkansas. An at the same time, by a separate ee, for the same consieration, he grante, bargaine, an sol to the sai John Baptiste, five negro slaves, who with their incréase, are the slaves now in suit, as his absolute property an estate- An on the same ay, sai Notrebe also execute to the sai Bellette’the following instrument, to wit: “Know all men by these presents, that I, Freerick Notrebe, of the Post of Arkansas, Territory an county of Arkansas, eclare to whom it may concern, that my father-in-law, John B. Bellette (alias Enselma) renere me services 25 years, an by his care, economy an continue assiuity to protect my interests, has been an aitional han to help me in accumulating an saving some property. An in consequence a remuneration from me to him, is only just an equitable, an without any cause whatever prejuicial to my chilren, I am willing, an by these presents, o will that my sai father-in-law be inepenent in his ol age from the caprice of my sai chilren, an for these reasons alone, (not incluing many others of some weight) an in case I ie before him, as Go an Provience best knows, I wish an inten, that he shall take out of my estate, before any ivien be mae by my chilren, or their representatives, the sum of three thousan ollars, in lawful money, or the equivalent in property at a fair valuation, at his option; an I absolutely will an orer that my heirs, executors, or aministrators shall truly an honestly execute this act, as a legitimate compensation ue to the sai J. B. Bellette, the father of my ear an belove wife, Felicite. I also wish an inten, that shoul my mother-in-law, Elizabeth Bellette, o service to my sai father-in-law an myself, then, that she will receive the legal interest of the sai onation of $3,000, for her lifetime, an request my chilren to a any surplus, (if they are able) to give her a full competency, an to rener her happy. The house an the slaves given to my father-in-law, by two instruments of wi'iting, bearing the same ate as this one, will be also her property for life, an shall have an keep possession, to enjoy.it as her own property.”
These three instruments were uty execute an elivere to the sai Bellette, in whose hans they remaine until his eath; until which time the female slaves continue in his possession an exclusivé use, an the males also, or others in their place. Notrebe, uring the lifetime of Bellette, set up no claim to the slaves, but on the contrary, amitte the title to be in Bellette, by offering to buy or swap for one of them. He i, however, pay taxes on them in his own name. The families (Notrebe an Bellette’s) live pretty much as one family, though occupying ifferent builings. Notrebe furnishe provisions for both. Bellette ie in possession of the slaves in 1838. After his eath Mrs. Bellette occupie a room in the same house with Notrebe as a member of his family. In 1843 or 1844 Notrebe enie Mrs. Bellette’s right to the property. In 1843 he mae his will, the tenth article of which is as follows: “Having alreay given as a gift by a ee, an a bill of sale uner ate of July the 17th, 1835, some property an slaves to the late John B. Bellette, (alias Enselma) my father-in-law, which has not been expene by him in his lifetime, the same property is to be revertible as a life estate to his wiow, Elizabeth Bellette, my mother-in-law, an having also secure to the sai late John B. Bellette ecease, by an instrument of writing, uner ate July 17th, 1835, a sum of three thousan ollars in property, at fair valuation, to be receive from my estate after my ecease, if in nee of it, now the same clause is also in favor of, an revertible to the sai Elizabeth Bellette, my mother-in-law, an my absolute will an esire are, that this promise be effecte after my ecease, if she is in want, an to be fulfille to the last point. An I recommen my belove wife, an my two heirs, John an Mary, to continue to cherish her in her ol age, an to treat her well in procuring my mother-in-law as goo a maintainance as circumstances will enable my wife an two heirs, John an Mary, for their goo ol mother an granmother.”
In 1849, Notrebe ie, leaving his wife an mother-in-law, the plaintiffs in this suit, who uner the facts above, claim jointly the slaves in controversy. The efenants on the other han, claim the slaves as the executors of the last will of Mr. Notrebe.
The court below upon the agree facts, or special verict eclare the law to be in favor of the plaintiffs an renere jugment accoringly. From which ecision, uner the special reservation of exception in the submission of the facts to the court, the efenant excepte, an by appeal has brought the-case before us for ecision.
There is in this case no question as to facts, they having been ascertaine an agree upon, an we are calle upon to eclare the law which arises upon them.
At the outset it is contene by the appellant, that the three first instruments bearing the same ate an mae touching the same subject matter, shoul be taken as one instrument; an that as the latter was testamentary in its character, the others must follow it, an thereby they shoul all be so consiere. It is true that these several instruments werebetween the same parties, an were eviently intene for atwo-fol common purpose: to provie means for the present comfort an inepenent support of an age relative, an also, in case of contingency to provie for further support after the eath of the obligor or onor. The present wants of Mr. Bellette were supplie by an absolute ee for a house, an slaves to wait upon an work for him. The first two instruments, absolute an unconitional, effecte this; an although there is manifeste throughout a praiseworthy solicitue on the part of Mr. Notrebe to provie for his father-in-law, above all care for remuneration, still it is expressly amitte by him, an we must so consier it, that these instruments were mae upon a full an valuable consieration. They are neither gifts nor legacies, but ees of sale upon valuable consieration, not to take effect at a future ay, but instantly, an which, in this instance, was followe up by the actual possession an enjoyment of the property. Mr. Notrebe amitte the property to be Mr. Billette’s until after his eath, an after that time, as we shall presently see, he might well have asserte claim to the property. The thir instrument, it is true, relates to the same subject matter, an although that too, is acknowlege to be upon full consieration, an only what is ue, it is mae to epen upon two contingencies; first, the eath of Mr.- Notrebe, an seconly, the pecuniary circumstances of Mr. Bellette. Amitting the testamentary character of this instrument in several leaing particulars, we are not of opinion it can raw to it the other two instruments an efeat their obvious intent an legal effect.
If we were permitte to consier these as voluntary gifts, without other consieration than the respect an regar of Mr. Notrebe for his father-in-law, an a sense of uty to provie for him the means of support, after he, by his eath, shoul be no longer permitte to o so, then the argument of counsel an authorities cite, to which we have given attentive consieration, woul have their full force an application, but these instruments evience a sale of property to pay a ebt, a ebt amitte by Mr. Notrebe, an therefore conclusive upon him. By the force an effect of each of them, a perfect title veste in Mr. Bellette, which no subsequent act of Mr. Notrebe coul efeat. If the effect of the thir instrument, as contene for, is to constitute these three instruments one, an to make them all testamentary, then Mr. Notrebe woul have ha an unquestionable right to revoke them at pleasure uring his life. But surely it cannot be contene that a bill of sale vesting an absolute title in slaves, upon full an valuable consieration coul, after its execution, be revoke; an yet such must be the consequence, if the argument of counsel be correct. The very nature of these instruments forbis that they shoul be consiere testamentary. In the case of Habergham vs. Vincent, 2 Ves. Jr. 204, the ee was execute after the will, mae in reference to it, an coul only exist in it: whatever title passe was in reference to the will. Here the bill of sale was at the same ate, upon full consieration, an coul well exist an take effect without reference to the thir instrument. We are satisfie that the slaves passe to Mr. Bellette, an were hel by him as his absolute property, an at his eath, became the property of Mr. Notrebe, by virtue of his marriage with the aughter an sole heir of Mr. Bellette, subject to the ower interest of his wife, Mrs. Elizabeth Bellette. At the eath of Mr. Notrebe, uner the provisions of the tenth article of his will, Mr. Bellette acquire a life estate in the slaves. Of course, as Mr. Notrebe hel them subject to her ower interest, he coul only convey by will such interest as he ha, which when taken in connection with her ower interest veste in her an absolute estate for life.
We have not overlooke the statute, sec. 56, Dig. ch. 4, which exempts property acquire by the wiow from sale,to pay ebts, &c., but that statute coul not in our opinion affect the right of the husban to sell or evise the estate.
This being our conclusion, it follows, that Mrs. Notrebe has no present interest or estate in the slaves an was improperly mae a party plaintiff in the suit.
Mrs. Bellette’s right as evisee veste at the eath of Mr. Notrebe, but the question is, can she assert such right by action at law against the executor. We shoul think not; at least until the ebts are pai, or time allow'e for paying them, because she takes her title uner the will, subject to the payment of ebts, an the estate passes into the hans of the executor in the first place to satisfy ebts. Upon this point we have been referre to several authorities, which we think quite satisfactory. Anrews vs. Hunneman. 6 Pick. Rep. 129. Toller's Ex. 306. Lynch vs. Thomas, 3 Leigh 682, settle the question as to the right of the executor to hol the property in the first instance for the payment of ebts. The right of the legatee to his legacy is suspene, until by the assent of the executor or the lapse of time, for the settlement of the estate, this suspension is remove. Thus in Mississippi, where A. bequeathe a slave to B., which was in B’s possession at the testator’s eath, it was hel that the executor might recover hire for the perio of one year after the grant of letters testamentary, he having until that time to examine into an settle the estate. King vs. Cooper, Walker's Miss. Rep. 389.
Replevin is a possessory action, an the plaintiff, in orer to maintain it, must have at the commencement of his suit, a right to the possession. Uner the circumstances of this case, it is consistent with the rights of the parties an the evience, to suppose that the slaves w'ere, at the time of Mr. Notrebe’s eath, in. the possession of either Mrs. Bellette or himself. They both live together; the slaves ha been up to the eath of Mr. Bellette, in his possession, an after his eath became by operation of law, the joint property of Mr. Notrebe as heir, in right of his wife, an of Mrs. Bellette as the wiow entitle to ower. If, after the eath of Mr. Notrebe, she retaine an possese herself of the slaves, an the estate of Mr. Notrebe was clearly sufficient to pay his ebts without rawing upon specific legacies, then slight circumstances might be sufficient from which to infer assent; such as continue acquiescence by the executor in her possession, after time ha been allowe to examine into the conition of the estate. How this was, the facts as agree upon o not show.
In view, therefore, of the whole case, without unertaking to say, from the facts before us, whether Mrs. Bellette might or not have maintaine her action in replevin for the recovery of the slaves in her own right, it is very clear that no action coul be maintaine by Mrs. Bellette an Mrs. Notrebe jointly, because, as we have seen, Mrs. Notrebe ha neither title nor right of possession to the slaves.
The court below therefore erre in eciing the question of law arising upon the agree facts or special verict, in favor of the right of the plaintiffs jointly to maintain their action, an in renering jugment thereon for the plaintiffs.
Let the jugment be reverse an set asie.

elivere the opinion Of the Court-.
This is a suit in chancery, brought in the. Crawfor Circuit Court for the purpose of having correcte a mistake in the escription of certain lans to which the complainant sets up title. The substance of the complaint is, that John Dillar, who resie in the county of Crawfor, was the legal owner of several quarter an fractional quarter sections of lan; composing one tract of about 937 acres, on which he ha a farm an resie with his family in the year 1841, an continue there to resie until his eath. On the 14th ay of September of that year, jugment was renere against him in the Crawfor Circuit Court, in favor of Thomas E. an Heiro T. Wilson, for $3,800, upon which execution issue on the 3 of August, 1842, which at the instance of Dillar, was levie upon the tract of lan oil which he so resie, but that the sheriff, in recoring his levy upon the writ, misescribe several of the tracts of lan levie upon, by recoring other tracts, not the property of Dillar, instea of those actually levie upon; that afterwars, at the instance of Dillar, his lans were appraise, an because no one woul bi two-thirs of their value, they were returne not sol. On the 30th August, 1843, an alias fi. fa. issue, on the back of which was enorse the former levy, an that uner this writ the sheriff avertise an sol the lan on the 25th of September, "" 1843, at public sale, to George W. Paschal for $500, to whom he execute' a ee for the same. That the same mistake committe in recoring the return- of the levy upon the original writ was continue in the after proceeings incluing the avertisements of the lan, an the ee to Paschal; but that the actual levy an sale were of Dillar’s lan.
It appears that Dillar was in embarrasse circumstances, an that several other jugments ha been renere in sai court against him, all of which as well as that of the Wilsons’ were uner the control of Paschal for collection. That at the instance of Dillar, it was agree between himself an Paschal, that Paschal shoul buy the property, then recognize by Dillar as his homestea place, an give him (Dillar) twelve months to reeem the same by paying Wilson’s jugment, an part of one of the other jugments uner Paschal’s control as collector. That Dillar ie without having reeeme the property, an that Paschal afterwars, on the 14th ay of September, 1849, conveye the lan to Joseph H. Bailey, by quit claim ee, for $3,000, an that Bailey on the same ay sol itto complainant for $1,000, payable in twelve months, an took from complainant a bon lor the payment of the purchase money, an execute to him a covenant, by which he boun himself to convey to complainant the lan upon the payment of the bon for $1,000. That both Paschal an Bailey in goo faith sol, an intene to convey the Dillar homestea place, but were le into a mistake in the escription of the lan by following that in the sheriff’s ee. Soon after the purchase óf complainant the mistake was iscovere, to correct which this suit is brought.
The plaintiff in execution, the aministrator an heirs of Dillar, Paschal an Bailey are mae efenants, an with the exception of the aministrator an one of Dillar’s chilren, an infant, the answers may be consiere as a full an circumstantial amission of the material- facts in issue.
The- aministrator enies all knowlege or information with regar to the levy, or sale of the property, or of any knowlege, unerstaning or agreement of his intestate, except that which he erive from the complainant’s bill, an touching these points oes not answer. The other allegations are from information an belief amitte. The infant efenant answers by guarian, an his rights are as fully protecte as if he ha by answer enie each allegation in the bill.
The main fact put in issue by the answer, is the fact of the allege mistake; an preliminary to an examination of the evience, is the question presente upon the exception to the amission of the eposition of Ogen. The objection to his evience is, that he is the security of the complainant to efenant Bailey for the purchase money of the lan in suit. It seems that Bailey at the outset was content to take the complainant’s bon, payable at twelve months, for the purchase money, an to hol the lan as secui’ity for the pa3'ment thereof. But when he ascertaine that there was a mistake in the numbers of the lan, whereby his security for the purchase money to the value of the lans not embrace in the ee ha faile, he became issatisfie an thereupon, by way of aitional security Ogen, Paschal, an others, execute to him a note for $1,000 payable at the same time the first note was to have been pai, with a memoranum enorse thereon by Bailey, that the payment of the bon first given shoul be a ischarge of the note,, whereby Ogen in effect became the security for the purchase money for the lan, part of which is now here in suit. This aitional security was taken in consequence of the iscovere mistake. There can be no question of Ogen’s immeiate interest in the suit; inee this is broaly amitte by counsel who notwithstaning argue that his interest is equally balance, because, let the suit be ecie for or against the complainant he must be ischarge. If for him, by requiring the $1,000 for which he is boun to- be pai before the ecree is renere, or if against him,, the court must necessarily rescin the contract, an cancel the note. As regars the first proportion, although the court might have ecree the payment ofthe purchase money at that time, it i not necessarily follow that such shoul be the ecree : an the ecree renere in this cause shows that such was not the case; so far from it, the express terms of the ecree are that the security shall not be ischarge. An, as respects the .other alternative, a rescisión of the contract is wholly inconsistent, as well with the allegations as the prayer for relief; au the answer of Bailey furnishes no groun for enlarging the issue. If the plaintiff ha oubts as to his title to the specific relief praye, he ■shoul have presente his case in a ouble, aspect, an praye relief accoringly. Story Equity Pl. 42. Moore vs. Maen, 2 Eng. 530.
Bailey no oubt was willing that the correction shoul be mae, his answer is alone responsive to that state of case, but it by no means follows that he woul assent to have his contract can-celle, an the eviences of ebt surrenere, upon a mere question of partial failure of consieration, nor can it be that a chancellor woul ecree that he shoul o so, unless upon an issue for that purpose an upon which he might be hear in efence, it be foun equitable that it shoul be one, so that the witness coul not -escape his liabilily upon either alternative; certainly not in the last, an it seems he i not in the first. He was clearly incompetent to testify, an his eposition shoul have been suppresse.
The remaining evience is by no means satisfactory upon the most important points in issue: the actual levy an sale of the lan not inclue in the sheriff’s return.
As regars the levy, the facts that the process was against Dillar, that there was returne upon the writ about the same quantity of lan really owne by him, that the valuation was taken at his instance, an that the appraisers i actually appraise the property known as Dillar’s homestea place, are all strong circumstances, an yet there is no positive proof that the sheriff ever intene to levy, or i levy upon these lans; but on the contrary, there are his official returns on several writs, his avertisement an ee, all his official acts which show affirmatively that he i not make such levy. As regars the sale, but one witness is foun to testify. He is strongly impresse with the belief that the sheriff announce to the by-staners that he offere the Dillar homestea place; of this he is not positive, an oes not remember the language use, nor can he say positively, that the sheriff i more than rea off the numbers from his levy, but thinks he i. This witness says that there were some forty persons present, an the fact that out of that number but one witness was examine as to the unerstaning at the time of the sale, in regar to the property sol, reners it improbable that if the property was offere as Dillar’s homestea, it was generally so unerstoo by the biers an by-staners.
The evience, upon which a written instrument or contract is altere or correcte, must be clear an free from oubt. In Henkle vs. The Royal Exchange Insurance Company, 1 Ves. 317, Lor Harwick sai the court ha jurisiction to relieve in re-. spect to a plain mistake in contracts in writing. In Ingram vs. Chil 1 Bro. 94, Lor Thurlow sai, “that a mistake creating an equity e hors the ee, shoul be proven as much to the satisfaction of the court as if amitte.” Juge Story in Unite States vs. Monroe, 5 Mason 577, sai “in cases of asserte mistakes in written instruments, it is not enie that a court of equity may reform the instrument, but such a court is very slow to exercise such an authority, an it requires the strongest an clearest evience to establish the mistake. It is not sufficient that there be some reason to presume a mistake, the evience must be clear, unequivocal an. ecisive.” An in Gillaspie vs. Moore, 2 Johns, Ch. Rep., Chancellor Kent reviews many of the English ecisions an fully recognizes the rule, that in all such cases the mistake must be clearly an fully proven.
So that this rule, when applie to contracts, may be consiere as well settle, an there certainly is no goo reason why the rule shoul not also be applie with equal force to the return ot a sworn officer, an to his ee eliberately mae an approve in court. Whilst therefore, corrections may be mae of mistakes when clearly an satisfactorily proven to be such, less than this strictness woul be attene with the most serious consequences, particularly where the instrument to be reforme or change is, as in this instance, the evience of title to real estate,
When teste by this rule, the evience before us, although it oes raise a strong presumption that the levy an sale were mae or intene to be mae of Dillar’s entire homestea tract, is not of that clear an conclusive character to entitle the complainant to relief.
We have not overlooke the groun taken by counsel, that the sale was mae uner a fi.fa., with a former levy enorse thereon, instea of a ven. ex. to sell the lans so levie upon, an that the whole tract was offere together instea of separate tracts, an also that the lans now sought to be recovere were (if sol at all) sol without having been previously avertise. These are all questions which may well be consiere in a suit like this, in the nature of a bill for specific performance, because courts of equity will not interfere to ecree specific execution of a contract, where manifest wrong or injustice woul result from it. To o so woul be giving ai to consummate a wrong commence, which is never one, 2 Story Equity 53.
It is true, that in this case the process an proceeings uner which the sale was mae, in connexion with the return, in which no formal levy appears to have been mae uner the secon writ, are of a oubtful character, (in regar to which, however, it is not necessary, uner the circumstances of this case, to express any opinion) an that the sale of the lans in ispute (if mae at all) was mae without notice an purchase by the attorney for the plaintiff in execution for $500, when, accoring to the appraise value mae some time before the sale took place, they were worth $7,900 or more, an by evience in this case, since the sale, $3000. §o that the lan was sol in all reasonable probability, for less than one-sixth of its actual value. All of these circumstances woul have been presente for consieration if the mistake as allege ha been satisfactorily proven.
.But as .such proof has not been auce, in view of the whole case .an the peculiar attitue in which the parties are presente upon the recor, an the facts connecte with their respective fights, we .think the ecree of the Circuit Court shoul be reverse an the bill ismisse.
Let the ecree be reverse, an the cause be remane with instructions to ismiss the bill with costs.

elivere the opinion of the court.
This suit was commence on the 6th ay of September, 1849, on a promissory note mae by the efenants, together with Thomas J. Lacy, an G. N. Causin, ate 24th February, 1843, an payable to the plain tiff one year after ate. It will be necessary to state only so much of the pleaings an evience as will show istinctly the questions presente on the recor.
The efenants severally, pleae that the cause of action ha not accrue within three years next before the commencement of the suit. The plaintiff replie that on the 23 ay of September, 1845, Lacy, the principal ebtor, mae a partial payment upon the note to the plaintiff, an on the 26th ay of February, 1848, an within three years from the time of such payment, the plaintiff commence suit in tlie Pulaski Circuit Court, upon the note, against all the makers, the alias summons, issue in which suit, was serve upon the present efenants, an not serve upon the other efenants, Lacy an Causin, who ha eparte this life; an in the progress of that suit, the efenant, Fowler, having file his plea in abatement of the alias writ of summons, the plaintiff emurre to the plea, an the emurrer being submitte the court, there, on the 23 ay of June, 1849, overrule the emurrer, an Hie plaintiff eclining to reply to sai plea, an electing to rest on her sai emurrer, the court then an there ajuge that the efenants go hence without ay, an recover of the plaintiff their costs in that behalf expene, as woul appear by the-recor, &c., an that afterwars, on the Cth ay of September, 1849, an within one year after the sai last mentione jugment, the plaintiff commence the present suit against these efenants.
To this replication the efenants severally emurre, because5 it i not appear that the plaintiff ha suffere a non suit in the5 former action, so as to bring her within the saving clause of the5 statute. These emurrers being overrule, the efenant, Pike,, reste; an Fowler rejoine, 1st, enying the fact of part payment by Lacy ; 2, that there was no such recor of the former suit as allege in the replication.
Upon the trial of the issues to Fowler’s rejoiners, it appeare; to the court that there was such a recor. But, in-orer to prove5 the fact of the part payment by Lacy, the Bank offerre in evience her books, kept at the time by A. E. Thornton, her Financial Receiver, or Cashier, in liquiation, proving in connection therewith, that Thornton was such receiver on the 2 of September, 1845, an ha the charge an custoy pf the books, recors,, accounts an notes of the Bank: that he ha left Arkansas after the institution of the present suit, an about a year previous to the trial; that he ha gone to parts unknown, an that since his eparture, he ha been an was beyon the process an jurisiction of this court. The books of the Bank showe the part payment by Lacy, at the time allege in the replication, the entry being as prove, in the han-writing of Thornton in the blotter, an poste by him into the leger. The court below exclue the Bank books an the proofs offere in connection therewith, as being incompetent evience.to prove the partial payment allege to have been mae by Lacy, an jugment went against the Bank, to reverse which she prosecutes this writ of error.
In the case of the State Bank vs. Magness, 6 Eng. 343, the plaintiff replie to the plea of the statute, that in a former action for the same cause, she was non-suit an sue again within the year; an the recor offere in support of this replication showe a jugment ismissing the suit, because the plaintiff, being-rule to file a bon for cost, faile to o so. The court there hel that the ismissal was, in effect a non-suit, an within the perview of the saving clause in the statute, an we are satisfie of the correctness of the ecision upon the facts of that case. But the opinion there woul seem to go to the length of holing, that wherever the plaintiff is not preclue by a ecision upon the merits from bringing another action, he comes within the meaning of the exception in the statute for limiting actions, an may bring a new suit within a year.
It is universally true, wherever it can be shown, accoring to the rules of law, that the merits of a suit have not been passe upon or etermine, the plaintiff is not estoppe by the ajuication, but may have a fresh action. This principle oes not etermine the plaintiff’s right to suspen or avoi the bar of the statute by suing again within the year, because that woul be giving an effect to the term “non-suit,” not warrante by any ajuge cases, an which the statute coul not have contemplate.
So, on the other han, it is true, that in orer for a plaintiff to have the benefit of this saving in the statute, it is not necessary that there shoul be a formal or technical jugment of non-suit. The plaintiff may iscontinue as to a part of the efenants, or he may suffer a iscontinuance of the action as to all, or he may ismiss, or submit to a ismissal of his suit. But in all such cases, wherever the proceeing of the court is equivalent to a non-suit, for the purpose of extening the time for bringing a fresh action, the iea is, that the plaintiff goes out of court voluntarily, or submits to the orer of the court requiring him to o so; an the court oes not ajuicate the cause, so that there is no final jugment to which a writ of error will lie, because the party cannot reverse a proceeing which he has sought or acquiesce in.
In this State, the non-suit, or a ismissal, or iscontinuance, ■ which is equivalent to it, must of necessity, be voluntary. It is settle here—see Martin an Van Horn vs Webb, 5 Ark. 72, ever since ahere to — that the plaintiff cannot, upon any avice or interposition of the court, be compelle to take a non-suit: but he has the right to insist that the court shall procee with his cause, an ajuicate it for or against him, an for no other conceivable object than to have final jugment given, to which he may prosecute his writ of error, if he choose to complain of the proceeings.
In the case now uner consieration, the plaintiff, when her emurrer to the plea in abatement of the writ in the former suit was overrule, ha the right to reply to the plea, if she thought proper to test the truth of it, or submitting to the emurrer to have sue out an alias writ, an so kept the same suit continuously on foot—see King vs. The State Bank, at January term, 1853 — or taken a non-suit, an accoring to the reason of the statute, a voluntary ismissal of the action woul have the same effect, in orer to enable her to sue again within the year. But when she electe to rest on her emurrer an procee no further, an so force the court to rener final jugment in favor of the efenants, it was an election on her part not to suffer a non-suit, but to take the chances of a reversal on error. A party thus situate, might not, inee, prosecute his writ of error, but rather choose to bring a new action, which he coul well o, because not preclue by any ajuication upon the merits. But the ajuication in question woul not, for that reason, be any the less final, an we coul not hol it to be a jugment of non-suit, without, at the same time, holing that a writ of error woul lie to a jugment of non-suit. Upon the principle contene for by the plaintiff in error, wherever a plaintiff eclines to amen, an final jugment goes upon emurrer sustaine to the eclaration, he woul come within the saving of the statute, as if having suffere a non-suit, because there was no such jugment as preclue another action, if rightly brought for the same cause.
We conclue therefore that there is no error in the jugment here, because the replication an the recor offere in proof of it, fail to show such a jugment of non-suit as woul avoi the bar set up in the plea.
It was, moreover, necessary for tbe plaintiff, in orer to avoi tbe bar, to couple the payment allege to have been mae by Lacy, with the former suit. Even if the court below erre in rejecting the evience offere to prove this payment, the jugment woul nevertheless, upon the whole recor, have to be affirme. But as to the proof of part payment no substantial ifference is perceive between this case an The State Bank vs. Barber et al. 7 Eng. 775, an no goo reason is shown why the ecision there ought not to he followe.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The appellant sue the appellee as enorser of a promissory note past ue. The enorsement was mae on the 1st of February, 1851. All the parties, maker, payee, an enorsee, resie at Little Rock, but at the ate of the enorsement the maker was temporarily absent in Kentucky, from whence he returne home some time between the 10th au 25th of the same month. Conceing every fact in favor of the enorsee, which the evience conuce to prove, it woul appear that on the 26th of February he presente the note to the maker an emane payment of it, which was refuse, of which, on the same ay he notifie the enorser in person, an that he looke to him for payment. The two in company then calle upon the maker, who mae a partial payment on the note to the enorsee, who now seeks to recover of the enorser the resiue remaining unpai.
Various points are argue upon the instructions given an refuse in the court below, only one of which is material to be consiere, as upon that, the jugment in favor of the enorser will have to be affirme.
Accoring to the existing law of this State, the enorsee or assignee of this note ha choice of two courses to pursue. If he esigne to charge the enorser, as of commercial paper, accoring to the law merchant, he was boun to make presentment an eman of payment from the maker, an give notice of non-payment to the enorser, accoring to the rules of the law merchant. Or neglecting that course, he might, after prosecuting with ue iligence a fruitless suit against the maker, have ha recourse against his assignor, accoring to the law concerning assignments, as heretofore unerstoo an practice in this State.
In Jones vs. Robinson, 6 Eng. 504, it was recognize an settle in this court, that accoring to the law merchant the enorsement of a note past ue, was equivalent to the rawing of a new bill by the enorser upon the maker in favor of the enorsee, payable on eman. That, in orer to charge the enorser in such .case, payment must be emane of the maker within a reasonable time after the enorsement, an ue notice of his refusal .given to the enorser. An that what woul be a reasonable time, though epening to some extent on the situation of the parties, an the circumstances of each case, is always a question of law for the court, accoring as the facts might be proven or amitte.
Our opinion is that if the rights an liabilities of parties to negotiable paper are sought to be ascertaine an fixe accoring to the law merchant, new to some extent, an not generally practice in this State, its rules, so far as applicable to our system of law, ought, for the best interests of all whom they may concern, to be aopte, as they are unerstoo accoring to the most approve authorities an steaily ahere tol
In this case the enorsement having the effect of a bill payable on eman, no ays of grace were allowe. As the parties all resie in the same town where the enorsements were mae, the enorsee was boun to make presentment an eman payment of the maker, in person, or at his usual place of business, or at his resience, on the ay of the enorsement, or on the ay following, an to give notice of non-payment to the enorser on the ay of the presentment, or on the next succeeing ay. The temporary absence of the maker i not excuse presentment at his place of business or aboe. As the unertaking of the enorser was conitional that he woul pay if the maker i not, upon presentment in ue season, an upon his being uly notifie of the maker’s efault, it evolve on the enorsee to prove that he ha use the iligence require of him, or such facts, if they existe, as woul by law ispense with it.
Without unertaking to lay own any rule of universal application, as to what constitutes reasonable iligence, it suffices here to say that the elay of the holer for 25 ays, without any attempt to make presentment, or give notice of non-payment, where the parties resie in the same place, amounte to such negligence as woul ischarge the enorser.

elivere the opinion of the Court. The plaintiff in error has appeale from the jugment of the court below, ismissing his suit for the want of a sufficient bon for costs. The objections to the bon appear to be, that the ay of the month of its ate is left blank, an that it is given by a firm, signe by their firm name an style uner seal. The suit was commence on the 18th of September, 1851, an the bon for costs has the following enoi’sement, signe by the clerk: “The above bon approve by me, September 18,1851, an file before writ issue.” On the hearing before the court of the issue upon the efenant’s motion to ismiss, the plaintiff prouce the bon an enorsement referre to, an mae part of the recor, an the facts in evience were, that the bon in question ha been file before the commencement of the suit, an approve by the clerk of the court as sufficient: that it ha been signe, seale, an elivere by J. H. Patterson, one of the firm of Byers & Patterson; that he was a resient of this State an responsible for the costs which might accrue in the suit in question; an that the plaintiff was a non-resient;
The statute requires the non-resient plaintiff, about to commence a suit in any circuit court, to file in the office of the clerk, the obligation of some responsible person, being a resient of this State, for the payment of all costs which may accrue in such action'.
The question here is not whether one partner can bin his co-partner, by an instrument uner seal, so as to make the firm liable upon an obligation execute by one in their joint names, nor is there any question as to what authority or assent by the partner not signing will be sufficient to make such an obligation obligatory upon him. The bon was certainly execute by one of the firm, an as hel in Day vs. Lafferty, 4 Ark. 450, it is goo against him. Whenever it is amitte, as ecie in Ferguson vs. The State Bank, 6 Eng. 512, that the plea of non est factum goes onlyto thepersonal ischargeof the party pleaing it; anthatthe party, who execute the ee, continues liable, it follows that the statute in this case has been substantially complie with. Neither the efenant, nor any officer of the court, who may become intereste in the bon for costs, has any right to insist that there shall be more than one security for costs, if he be a solvent an responsible person. The case stans as if there were two securities, an one of them for any cause not liable on the bon or irresponsible.
The ate, though prima facie evience of the time of the execution is not necessary to the valiity of a ee, which takes effect from the time of its elivery.
If the Circuit Court thought the bon to be so informal or efective as likely to embarrass the efenant or the officers of the court, in the recovery upon it of their legal emans that woul accrue in the progress of the suit, it might, accoring to its iscretion, have rule the plaintiff to furnish a bon free from any such objection, as it woul, where there is a oubt of the continuing solvency of the security; but upon the facts state here, the ecision of the court absolutely ismissing the plaintiff’s suit is not, as we conceive, in accorance with strict law, or the reason of the statute.

The Bank replie, first; That on the ay of the execution of the note the efenants, together with their wives, execute a mortgage to her, upon certain real estate, to secure the ebt sue ' for; in which it was recite that by the rules an regulations of the Bank the note in question was payable in nine annual installments, the first payable twelve months after the ate thereof, at which time, in aition thereto, twelve months interest was to be pai in avance on the resiue of the ebt, an so on from year to year until the whole ebt shoul be pai, an proviing that in case the payments were so regularly mae, that the conveyance shoul be voi, but on failure in all or either of sai payments, the sheriff of Pulaski county shoul sell an convey the mortgage premises an apply the procees to the payment of the ebt; an averring that on the 1st March, A. D. 1848, the ebt being then wholly in arrears, neither the first nor any sub1 sequent instalment or any interest having been pai, the sheriff, in pursuance of the request of the Bank an of the provisions of the mortgage, avertise a sale of the mortgage premises, to take place in September following; whereupon Trapnali, claiming to be the owner of the mortgage premises, file a bill against the Bank, an procure an injunction restraining the Bank an the sheriff from proceeing any further with the sale, an that the bill is still pening an unetermine, an the injunction remains in force, by means whereof, as is allege, the Bank was prevente from pursuing her remey on the note aforesai.
The secon replication avers that the mortgage was mae cotemporaneously with the note eclare upon, as part an parcel of the same transaction, to secure the payment of the ebt, an that in the mortgage ee it was stipulate an eclare that sai note was payable in nine annual instalments, the first payable the 22 November, A- D. 1844, with interest, in avance on the resiue of the ebt, an yearly thereafter as set out in the first replication, an that the Bank accepte the mortgage, an that the same is still in force an in no way satisfie.
After oyer of the mortgage ee ha been crave an grante, the efenant emurre to both replications, in which the plaintiff joine; an the law having been foun for the efenant an the plaintiff electing to rest, jugment was renere for the efenant, an the Bank brought her case here by writ of error.
The Bank seems to rely in this court exclusively upon her first replication, an cites in support of it the twenty-seventh section-of the limitation statute, {Dig, ch. 99, p. 700), which provies that-“whenever the commencement of any suit shall be staye by an-injunction of any court of equity, the time uring which such in-junction shall be in force, shall not be eeme any portion of the-time in this act limite for the commencement of such suit.” ‘ If the Bank was proceeing to foreclose her mortgage, an the sta-tute of limitations ha been interpose, this provision of the sta-tute might, with more plausibility have been relie upon; but we think it clear that it cannot avail her, to isplace the bar in this case, where she is preceing at law to recover the ebt that was intene to be secure by the mortgage. The replication oes not set.up that the Bank was enjoine from commencing any action to recover the ebt, but from any “further proceeings in the matter of sai- sale,” an “restraining the sai Bank an the sai sheriff from- selling sai lots.” For aught that appears to the contrary in the replication, the Bank might have commence a suit at law, to recover the ebt for which the mortgage was but a security, at any time for near seven years, next before this action was commence; an inee this suit was commence an is still prosecute, as appears by this replication, pening the very injunction pleae in avoiance of the statute bar. It was the remey in rem only, that was enjoiue, not the inepenent remey in personam, now sought in vain by reason of the statute bar, which lapse of time has enable the efenants effectually to interpose against it.
The secon replication is equally ba,-because it oes not set up any matter in support of the promise eclare-upon, but a ifferent contract, which, if effectual for the purpose- for which it is-set up, woul be equally effectual to show that the Bank ha no right to maintain an action of ebt at all, when this one was commence.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This is an action of trover from the Hempstea Circuit Court, institute by Pryor against Ryburn, for a negro woman an her two chilren. There was verict, an jugment for the plaintiff, motion for new trial, which was overrule an Ryburn appeale to this court.
For the purpose of establishing his claim to the negroes, Pryor prove in the court below, that in the year 1826, he was marrie to Martha Ann Ryburn, the sister of the efenant an the aughter of Matthew Ryburn, in the State of Tennessee; an that Matthew Ryburn gave the negro woman to Pryor after the marriage: an that some time afterwars, when the negro was about to be sol for Pryor’s ebts, Matthew Ryburn expressly refuse to forbi the sale, saying that he ha given the negro to his aughter,. Mrs. Pryor; an that Pryor hel continue possession of her until 1835 or 1836, with the exception of a year or two about 1830, when Pryor’s father hel the negro in possession. In the fall of 1836, Matthew Ryburn remove from Tennessee to Texas, an on his way receive the negro woman from Pryor an took her to Texas with him, Pryor furnishing her with a horse to rie. On the roa to Texas Matthew Ryburn calle her Pryor’s negro. She was hire for the year 1837, as Pryor’s negro, with the rest of his negroes. In the year 1838, Pryor an his father-in-law mae a crop together, an the negro woman was put in as Pry- or’s property with his other negroes, an Pryor receive one-thir of the crop. They continue thus to live an crop together till about February, 1843, when Matthew Ryburn, having move away, sent his son, Montgomery Ryburn, who came with a gun an took the negro woman forcibly from Pryor. After this, Matthew Ryburn kept the negro in possession till the 1st January,. 1844, when he execute a bill of sale for her an her chil Maria, to the efenant, for $750, an elivere them to him Since 1826 the negro woman has ha three chilren, now in possession of the efenant. Pryor also introuce a witness to prove that in 1837 or 1838, Matthew Ryburn eclare more than once that the negro woman was the property of Pryor or Pryor’s wife. The competency of the evience of this witness was objecte to by Ryburn, but overrule by the court an the evience permitte to go to the jury.
Another witness state in his epositions: “That E. L. Pryor continue to hol sai negro as his property, till the year 1830, when I as constable levie an attachment on her as E. L. Pry or’s property in favor of Sami. Pryor as will more fully appear by the transcript from the Comity Court of Montgomery county, Tennessee, hereto annexe,, marke A., which is mae part of this eposition. My recollection is that at the sale of the negro above name uner sai attachment, Sami. Pryor, the father of plaintiff, purchase the sai negro girl. He took her into possession an retaine possession for some time, an sent the negro to E. L. Pryor, who ha remove to the Western District of Tennessee. I think this was in 1831 or 1832,1 am not certain which.”
“Attache to this eposition was what purporte to be a transcript containing, First: A copy of a writ of attachment, issue out of an returnable to “the County Court of Pleas an Quarter Sessions,” of Montgomery county, Tennesse, ate 20th January, 1830, commaning E. L. Pryor to be attache to answer the complaint of Sami. Pryor; Secon: Copy of affiavit of inebteness-by Sami.. Pryor, sworn to the same ay before Charles Barby, a justice of the peace, who issue an signe the writ: Thir, Attachment bon of Sami. Pryor an surety; Fourth: Return on the writ; showing levy, after levy of other attachments in favor of Hynes & Slaughter, upon many articles of personal property, Pryor’s interest in 80 acres of lan, “one negro girl, Julia,” an “one negro boy, Armstea.” Levy enorse as mae 20th Jan uary, 1830. Fifth. Jugment in favor of Sami, Pryor vs. E. L. Pryor, for $1,427 50, an a memoranum that execution issue to the sheriff of Montgomery county, on the 5th of August, 1830, but ha not been returne.”
Ryburn then offere to prove by a witness that his father, Matthew Ryburn, ha frequently on various occasions eclare in. 1842 an 1843, that he ha merely loane the negro woman to. Pryor, an that Pryor ha often re-elivere her an acknowlege the loan. The testimony was objecte to an rejecte by the court.
Pryor objecte to all testimony as to the statements of Matthew Ryburn since 1826, offere to show that he ha only loane the negro to Pryor..
The following instructions to the jury were aske by Pryor an given by the court, an excepte to by Ryburn:
1st. That the measure of amages was the value of the property at the time of conversion, an interest thereon at six per cent.
2. That taking a bill, of sale for the negro, assuming an claiming ownership, acting as owner an enying Pryor’s claim, constitute a conversion; an no eman was necessary.
3. That a bill of sale is not necessary to pass the title to negroes, but they may as weU pass by elivery; an a. gift accompanie by actual eliveryjm subsequent peaceable possession can no more be revoke i^R a sale.
4th. That as to the valujpf the woman an chil, the efenant not having prouce tfin, an shown them not to be of the best quality, the jury mayTairly presume the strongest against him, an make the highest value proven the measure of amages.”
Among other instructions aske by Ryburn an given by the court, the three following were objecte to by Pryor an exclue by the court, to which Ryburn excepte:
1st. “That if the jury-^Éfelieve from the evience that Matthew Ryburn hel an retaine possession of the negro slaves sue for, as his own property an claime them as such, the jury are boun to fin for the efenant, unless there was some instrument of writing uly recore, showing that the title was not in sai Matthew Ryburn.”
2. “That if the jury believe from the evience that the negroes in controversy, before the allege sale, were merely loane by Matthew Ryburn to Pryor, temporarily, with the right to reclaim them at any time, no sale uner execution or otherwise, or process against Pryor, woul alter, take away, or estroy the rights of Ryburn, unless he (Ryburn), so conceale such loan as to enable Pryor, by using the property as his own for a length of time, to acquire creit on the strength of that possession of the property. But if there was no such concealment on the part of Ryburn, either actual or constructive, he might reclaim the property after such sale, to the same extent as before, whether the property remaine in the hans of the purchaser at such sale, or in the hans of a subsequent purchaser.”
3. “That the sale in Tennessee, if any such sale an subsequent gift took place, (an the jury are to etermine from the evience whether any such sale or gift took place) in no respect change the attitue of Ryburn an Pryor, in regar to the property.”
Ryburn file his motion for new trial on the groun,
1st. The amission of irrelevant an incompetent evience for plaintiff; 2, The exclusion of projK- an competent evience offere by the efenant. 3, Giv jBPimproper instructions for the plaintiff. 4th, Refusing instrucW aske by the efenant! 5th, Verict contrary to instructioiw 6th, Verict contrary to law an evience. 7th, Verict ex(0t ve an unwarrante by proof. This motion the court over'. s <■., an Ryburn took his bill of exceptions.
It appears from the bill of exception hat Ryburn file á plea of the statute of limitations of three years, in bar of the action, which, on motion of the plaintiff was stricken from the files, to which the efenant excepte. ife-
ist. The court below, in striking from the files the efenant’s plea of the statute of limitations of three years, committe no error. We think it clear the perio of three years oes not apply to an action of trover. This case oes not come within section 6, of the Revise Statutes, in relation to limitations. “Trover is not an action ior taking or injuring goos or chattels. It goes on the groun of a fining an conversion.” The efenant having file his plea of five years in bar, the plea applicable to this case, the court ecie correctly, in striking the other plea of three years from the files.
2. It appears that uring the trial, the plaintiff, to prove the gift of the negro, offere the eclarations of the onor mae subpequent to the allege gift, but before the onor parte with his interest to the efenant. The efenant, in orer to rebut this, an to show that the negrb was merely loane an not given, offere the eclarations of the onor mae uring the same time. The court below receive as evience the eclarations of the onor in favor of the plaintiff an rejecte his eclarations offere in behalf of the efenant. The principle is well establishe, by repeate ajuications, that although a man’s eclarations are not evience for him, they are evience against him, anhis subsequent venee must abie those eclarations. If the plaintiff ha relie alone on the evience of the gift an elivery of the negro, without resorting on his part to the subsequent eclarations of the onor, although competent for him to o so, the eclarations of the onor offere by the efenant against the plaintiff ought to have been rejecte. But as the plaintiff thought proper to resort to the eclarations of the onor to ascertain his intention, that testimony like every other ought to be given entire. We therefore think the court erre in excluing the eclarations of the onor offere by the efenant in this case. But in as much as the court i permit the efenant to prove by John W. Ryburn an Montgomery Ryburn, the subsequent eclarations of the onor against the plaintiff, in substance the same as that rejecte, we think the case shoul not be reverse for this error. Sims vs. Saners, 1 Harp. R. 374. 1 Bailey’s R. 113, 116.
3. Although the copy of a writ of attachment, the affiavit, attachment bon, the return on the writ showing the levy an jugment, mae an exhibit in the eposition of Jenkins, are no evience of the legality of the proceeings therein containe, or of the valiity of the subsequent sale of the negro uner them^ yet as facts or circumstances connecte with the acts an eclarations of the onor an in relation to which they took place, we think was goo evience to prove the negro was given an not loane, an for this purpose it was competent.
4th. The four instructions aske an given on the part of the plaintiff, we consier substantially the law. The only oubt that can reasonably arise is as to the 4th instruction, the substance of which is, “that the jury might make the highest value proven the measure of amages.” This we take to be the law.
5th. The first instruction aske an exclue on the part of the efenant is clearly erroneous. An instrument in writing' has never been hel necessary to pass the title to negroes.
6th. The secon instruction aske an exclue on the part of the efenant was also erroneous. For the reason that the title of the lener might be iveste in more ways than the “person in possession obtaining creit on the strength of the property,” as for instance, staning by an encouraging the sale of his pro* perty. The court, therefore, correctly exclue it.
7th. The 3 instruction aske an exclue on the part of the efenant was likewise erroneous. For the reason that the sale, taken in connection with the amissions an acts of the onor, was evience of the fact that the negro ha been given an not loane. Otherwise the sale an all the proceeings connecte therewith woul have been irrelevant an shoul have been exclue. The instruction, therefore, was not applicable, an therefore properly exclue-
The only remaining question to be consiere is as to the amount of amages given by the jury.
One witness testifie that he knew the negro woman in 1841 1842- — -thinks she ha one chil, an they were worth about $800, Another witness testifie that he owne negroes an knew the value of them; an that the negro woman an her chil in 1844, were worth $1300. Another testifie that in 1844 the negro wor snqn was worth $650, or $700, an her chil $300. Montgomery Ryburn testifie that at the time of the trial the negro woman an her three chilren were worth about $1250.
The jury, at the May term, 1852, renere a verict for $1875. Upon this evience we think the verict of the jury might wel} be sustaine.

elivere the opinion-of-the Court.-
On the secon ay of June,-1847, the plaintiff file in the office of a justice of the peace, the following instrument:-
“White county, March 3, 1842.
Twelve months after ate, we promise jointly an severally to pay to Abner Bailey, aministrator of Elijah Bailey, ecease, or orer, forty-five ollars an twelve an a half cents, for value receive, with interest at ten per cent, per annum, after maturity. Witness our hans an seals.
JOHN L. GATTON, [l.s.] ‘
JOHN M. CLARK, [l.s.]
AUGUSTUS GATTON, [l.s.]”
Upon which instrument so file the justice issue a summons requiring the efenants to appear before him to answer the complaint of Abner Bailey, aministrator of the estate of Elijah Bailey, ecease, on a note of han.
The case was brought by appeal from the justice’s court, to the Circuit Court, an upon the trial e novo, the efenant, Gatton, pleae, ne ungues aministrator, to which issue was taken, an the case was submitte to a jury for trial; when upon motion of the efenant, the writing obligatory was exclue as evience from the jury, because of an allege variance between the instrument offere, an that escribe in the summons, an to which the efenant was calle upon to efen. The court sustaine the motion to exclue the writing obligatory from the jury as evience, an thereupon a jugment was renere for the efenant, from which the plaintiff has appeale to this court.
The plea of ne ungues aministrator tenere an immaterial issue, because the writing obligatory was execute to the plaintiff, an the suit brought upon it was in his own name iniviually, an not as aministrator. The wors “aministrator, &c.,” were wors of personal escription, an the plaintiff might well elect to treat them as such, or .he might, at his election, have consiere the writing obligatory as assets, an have sue upon it as aministrator, as hel in Hemphill vs. Hamilton, 6 Eng. 428.
As regars the allege variance that the instrument escribe in the summons an which the efenant was calle to answer, was a note of han, an that offere in evience was a writing obligatory, it may be well to review our former ecisions; some of which woul seem to sustain the objection taken.
In the case of Jeffry vs. Unerwoo, 1 Ark. Rep. 108, the same state of facts presente here, came up for consieration. The efenant was summone to answer the complaint of the plaintiff upon a note of han, an the instrument offere in evience was a seale instrument. The court hel the variance fatal. It may be well to inquire whether, amitting this ecision to be correct, (an we will not question its correctness uner the statute then in force,) the change in our statute, since that ecision oes not materially affect the ecision.
Prior to the passage of our present statute, which took effect 20th March, 1839, it was not necessary to file the cause of complaint upon which the suit was brought, until the commencement of the trial! The efenant ha no other information in regar to the nature of the eman which he was summone to answer, than that isclose in the summons! The form of the summons is given, an uner it the instrument is to be set out. See sec. 41 Steel & McCamp. Dig. p. 365.
In this respect, our statute, as it existe when the present suit was commence, an as it now exists, is materially ifferent. Section 25 Dig., ch. 95 provies that “ wherever any suit shall be foune on any instrument of writing, pui-porting to have been execute by the efenant, such instrument shall be file with the justice, before any process shall be issue in the suit.” An in sec. 32, which gives the form of a summons, the escription of the eman, upon which the recovery is sought, is omitte. The Legislature, in making this change eviently intene, by require ing the instrument, upon which the suit was to be brought, to be file before the summons issue, to make it accessible to the efenant, an to furnish him with the necessary information, to enable him to efen against it.
The efenant no longer looks uner our present statute, to the summons for such information; an shoul it be unnecessarily inserte, it may be consiere as surplusage. The instrument file is the true evience of the nature of the complaint. It is in effect a eclaration, upon which the action rests, an is also, in some instances, the evience of the eman. We have no later ecisions that come fully up to the precise question now uner consieration. So far as they go, however, they may be sai to sustain the views which we have expresse. In Levy vs. Sherman, 1 Eng. 184, suit was brought on a bank note of the Bank of Missouri. The main question was, whether any cause of action was file; that is, whether a bank note, not enorse, was evience of inebteness from the plaintiff to the efenant. The coui't, in consiering that question, remarke upon this statute, to the effect that a escription of the instrument sue on, was unnecessary in the summons, as says the court, “it coul at all times be examine an inspecte by the parties. The plaintiff is require to put his cause of action on file, in orer that the averse party may know what he is calle upon to answer.”
In Patterson vs. Wilson, 1 Eng. 476, the summons was silent as to the cause of complaint. The justice escribe the instrument sue upon as a note, when, in fact, that file was a bon. The court hel, (an no oubt, correctly,) that the writing obligatory was competent evience.
In Anthony Ex parte, 5 Ark. 359, the suit was commence upon a change ticket, which, however, was not file. It is true that the summons require'the efenant to appear an answer in an action of account. But that was not the important enquiry. It was that no cause of action was file, an that if file it was such as the court coul not procee to try, as hel in Reeves vs. Clark.
We have taken occasion to make this brief review of the former ecisions of the court to show that the case of Jeffry vs. Unerwoo, is not authority uner, our present statute, an that our other ecisions favor the conclusions which we have announce; that, as the statute requires the instrument on which the suit is foune, to be file before the summons issues an ispenses with any escription of it in the summons, that the party efenant .shoul look to the instrument on file, an not to the summons for the cause of action against him. An consequently that a variance between the instrument on file, an that escribe in the summons will not avail the efenant on the trial. This construction is, in our opinion, in conformity with the spirit an intention of the statute, an will ten to remove a mere technical objection to a proceeing in a court where the most liberal construction shoul be inulge in favor of the regularity of its proceeings. The Circuit Court therefore erre in excluing the writing obligatory as evience from the jury.

elivere the opinion of the Court!
This w'as an action of assumpsit upon open account, to which the efenant pleae non-assumpsit an set-off. The bills of particulars on either sie consiste of various items, which were sought to be establishe by proof. No objection was mae to the introuction of evience, an the cause was submitte without instructions to the jury, who foun a balance of account in favor of the plaintiff below. The efenant move for a new trial, because the verict was contrary to evience, an upon the groun of newly iscovere testimony. The motion being overrule, he excepte to the ecision of the court an took a bill of exceptions, setting out the evience. From this it oes appear that the efenant auce testimony conucing to prove a a larger amount of off-set than was allowe him by the verict of the jury. But the istinction is to be taken between cases where this court will venture to set asie a verict, because it is without evience as to some material fact necessary to uphol it, an cases like the present, where the verict is objecte to merely because it is against evience. The principal item of his account, which the efenant here attempte to prove, an which the jury woul seem to have rejecte, was for a quantity of corn, which the plaintiff ha taken an sol from the plantation of the efenant. But it is inferable from the testimony, though conveye to this court through the unsatisfactory meium of a bill of exceptions, that this was corn which the plaintiff himself, ha raise upon a plantation of the efenant, an therefore, might have ha a right to ispose of as his own. The presumption is to be inulge that if the verict was grossly unjust to either party, because against the weight of evience, the juge who presie at the trial, woul not have refuse to exercise his iscretion to set it asie. But surely upon the verict an the concurring refusal of the court below to isturb it, every possible presumption ought to be ha in favor of its correctness. Else this court woul be assuming the power it has not, to ictate to juries that they must believe evience against their own convictions of its truth.
The efenant, in his affiavit, state that he ha iscovere, since the trial, that he coul prove by an absent witness, the payment of a certain sum of money to the plaintiff, not long before the commencement of the suit. The witness was then resiing in the county. Besies the want of iligence inicate by the tenor of the affiavit, there are various objections to its sufficiency. No such item is charge in the efenant’s bill of particulars, as that to which the newly iscovere testimony woul apply. If the efenant ha, in fact, mae such payment, it is reasonable to suppose he woul charge it in his account, among other items of cash an merchanize. But the affiavit oes not aver that any such payment was mae except by inference, because he was informe an believe he coul prove it by the witness referre to. If the efenant were inicte on this cautious affiavit for swearing falsely, that he ha mae such payment, it is oubtful whether he coul be convicte.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an appeal from the justice’s court to the Circuit Court, where, upon a trial e novo, the original efenant, after amitting the plaintiff’s eman, offere to prove an account ue from the plaintiff to him, as a matter of set-off, but upon the objection, that the efenant ha not given the plaintiff proper-notice of the propose set-off, while the case was in the justice’s court, the Circuit Court rule out the propose off-set. This action of the Circuit Court is the error assigne here.
It appears from the justice’s transcript, that upon the return ay of the summons, both parties appeare before the justice, an that the efenant then file a bill of the particulars of a set-off emane by him. This appears both by an entry upon the ocket an the justice’s enorsement of filing upon the bill of particulars. The efenant afterwars, the same ay, continue the cause for a month. At the next trial ay both parties were again present, an the cause was again continue by plaintiff. At the thir trial ay, both parties were again present, an, upon the hearing, the justice rule out the off-set upon the groun, as state in his transcript, of the “efenant’s failing to give the plaintiff notice of his off-set,” an thereupon gave jugment-for the plaintiff’s eman, an the efenant appeale.
Upon the trial in the Circuit Court, the efenant amitte the correctness of the plaintiff’s eman, but insiste upon the offset, that ha been rule out by the justice, an mae aitional proof by J. B. Lewis, who seems to have acte as his attorney, before the justice, that on the original trial ay before the justice at a time when the plaintiff was present in the house an before the cause was continue, the witness notifie the justice that he ha an off-set to file in the case, rea over the items in the hearing of the plaintiff, (but i not know whether the plaintiff actually i hear him,) an then hane it to the justice to file among the papers.
The statute provies that, upon the appeal, no other cause of action shall be trie in the Circuit Court than the same that was “trie before the justice, an no set-off shall be pleae that was not pleae before the justice, if the summons was serve on the person of the efenant, (Dig. p. 670, sec. 192.) It also provies that, “In orer to entitle a efenant to set-off any eman, he must give notice thereof to the plaintiff, either verbal or written, before the jury is sworn or the trial submitte to the justice,” (Dig. p. 652, se. 81, lut misprinte 71.) “An that when a set-off is foune upon an instrument in writing execute by the plaintiff, or his testator or intestate, or iipon an open account, he must, at the time of giving such notice, file with the justice such instrument, or a bill of the items of such account,” (Dig. p. 652, sec. 82.)
Consiering together these provisions of the statute we think the Legislature, without any intention to prescribe any particular moe of communicating notice, simply esigne to secure to the plaintiff notice in fact or its equivalent, as a pre-requisite for the efenant to set up an prove an off-set. This is strongly inicate by the inefinite provision,that notice maybe given either verbally or in writing, without any other regulation except that, as to time, it must be given before the jury is sworn or the trial is submitte to a justice. Hence it woul be as well communicate inirectly as irectly; either through the instrumentality of writing, or by wor of mouth, provie actual notice be in fact carrie home from the efenant to the plaintiff. Inee, so long as the cause remaine pening an unetermine before the justice, it-woul be in accorance with the spirit of the statute for the justice to receive a set-off at any time, an if the filing, whether before or on the ay of trial, be a surprise to. the plaintiff, he might claim a continuance, but being in court he is presume to have notice.
When the testimony of Lewis is consiere in connection with what is legitimately to be inferre from the justice’s transcript, the whole taken together are equivalent, in our opinion, to proof of actual notice. Whether or not the testimony of Lewis was prouce in the justice’s court, oes not in any manner appear, but this can in no way affect the existence of the fact of notice, upon which epene the right of the efenant to be hear as to his set-off, before the justice as well as upon his appeal before the Circuit Court, where the case is hear e novo absolutely, an hot e novo upon conition that some error of fact or law may be foun as in cases of appeal from the Probate Court.
Upon the establishment in the Circuit Court of this pre-requisite to his set-off, it woul be as unreasonable to refuse to hear him as to the whole of it, as it woul be to eny him a hearing, as to some one item only, in another case where, upon a regular trial upon the merits in the justice’s court, he ha faile to make proof as to this item only, although he ha prove all the others, an was now reay to prove this also.
We think, therefore, the court erre in ruling out the off-set, an for this error the jugment ought to be reverse, an the cause remane with instructions that the Circuit Court hear the case e novo, an allow the efenant below to establish his off* set on file by sufficient evience if he can.",legal_case

James F. Lee brought his suit in replevin against John Row-ark, for a mule. The general issue was pleae, an by consent of parties, the case was submitte to the court sitting as a jury. After having hear the evience the court foun for the plaintiff, an as the property ha not been replevie an elivere to the plaintiff, the court also hear evience, as well touching the amages for the etention of the property as the value thereof, an renere a jugment in his favor for the same. Whereupon, the efenant move the court to grant him a new trial, because the fining of the court was contrary to law an evience; which motion the court overrule. The efenant excepte an mae the evience matter of recor by his bill of exceptions.
The questions presente an argue by counsel are, first, as to the sufficiency of the evience to sustain the fining of the court; an secon, that it was error in the court to rener an absolute jugment for the value of the property.
As regars the first question, there can be no oubt but that the evience is sufficient to uphol the fining of the court. There is no lack of evience upon any point necessary to a recovery; an although the evience of several of the witnesses is somewhat contraictory, as well with regar to the purchase of the mule by the plaintiff, as the ientity of the mule in the efenant’s possession, as the same purchase by the plaintiff, it was the peculiar province of the court sitting as a jury to weigh the evience an etermine the facts, an having one so, we o not feel at liberty to isturb the verict.
After fining the issue for the plaintiff, the court, uner the circumstances of the case, properly ascertaine the value of the mule, but faile to rener a jugment thereon, in accorance with the statute. Section 39, ch. 13G Dig., provies “that in case the plaintiff shall recover jugment upon the whole recor, he shall be entitle, in aition to jugment for amages an costs, to a further jugment, that the property be replevie an elivere to him without elay; or in efault thereof, that the plaintiff recover from the efenant the value of the property ascertaine by the court or jury. Uner the provisions of the statute, the court shoul have renere jugment that the property be replevie an elivere; as well as for the value thereof. Uner the provisions of the statute jugment, when properly renere, the efenant may surrener the property an ischarge himself from the payment of the amages: but by the jugment, as renere in this case, he is eprive of the privilege of oing so.
For this error the jugment of the Circuit Court must be reverse, an the cause remane with instructions to the court below to rener jugment on the verict an fining of the court in accorance with this opinion.",legal_case

The complainant file her bill against the heirs, an the aministrator of the estate of William Arnett, an against Ephraim Myrick an Sherian W. Williams, in which she alleges that she is the wiow of sai intestate, who ie seize an possesse of two slaves, Green an Ey, in whom she claims a ower interest! The heirs an aministrator o not contest the complainant’s right to ower; but Myrick an Williams, who have the slaves in possession, assert title to them as purchasers at juicial sale.
By an agree statement of the facts signe an entere of recor, it is amitte that the slaves were uly levie upon an taken into possession on the first of January, 1849, uner a vali execution against the intestate: that after the levy an before the return ay of the writ, on the 22 January, 1849, the intestate ie: that afterwars, at a regular sheriff’s sale, the efenants, Myrick an Williams, bought an pai for the slaves, an took them into possession. All other facts concee, the question of contest was whether the intestate was so seize an possesse of the slaves at the time of his eath as to entitle the wiow to ower. The court below ecie against her right to ower, an ismisse her bill. An in this she alleges there is error.
The statute, Dig. ch. 59, sec. 20, provies that, “ A wiow shall be entitle, as part of her ower, to one-thir part of the slaves, ■whereof her husban ie seize or possesse, uring her natural life, an one-thir part of the personal estate in her own right.” This section, unlike that which allows ower in real estate, limits the wife’s right to ower to the slaves of which the husban was, at the time of his eath, seize or possesse, an cuts off all claim to ower where the slaves have been ispose of prior to his eath, an this without her co-operation, or assent. The whole question then turns upon the effect of the levy, which, although insufficient to ivest the efenant in execution of title to the property levie upon, for that oes not pass until after sale, 'oes, when mae on personal estate, isseize the efenant an ispossess him of the property levie upon; for whether the officer takes the property into possession or not, it is, in contemplation of law, in his custoy; he is responsible for it, an has a right to hol it against the claims of the efenant in execution, an all others. It is taken in satisfaction of the ebt, an is hel an taken as such until sol, or the levy is otherwise ischarge. The levy, in this case, was not only a isseizin in law, but also in fact, for the property was not only actually taken out of his possession, but beyon the control of the efenant, or his power to reclaim or reuce it to possession by mere force of legal right.
The efenant in execution, therefore, ha not at the time of his eath, such seizin or possession as to entitle the complain ant to ower in the slaves, an consequently there was no error in the ecree of the court below.

The eclaration was in ebt upon a writing obligatory, averring that it was mae by the efenant, Allis, payable to the plaintiff, Bener, “by the style of D. Bener, & Co.” At the return term, after oyer grante, Allis pleae that he i not make the writing obligatory, payable to the plaintiff, Bener, by the style of D. Bener & Co., as allege in the eclaration, but that he mae it payable to sai Bener an one James A. Henry, as partners, by the name, style, escription an firm of D. Bener & Co., an of which he put himself upon the country. A emurrer was interpose, an the causes assigne were : 1st, that the plea was not sworn to; 2, that it conclue to the country, an not with a verification; an 3, that it was frivolous. The emurrer was sustaine an final jugment was renere for the plaintiff below, an the cause brought here by writ of error.
Accoring to the course of ecisions in this court, the emurrer i not reach the first objection. To o this a motion to strike out was necessary. (Wilson & Turner vs. Shannon & wife, 1 Eng. R. 196. Harwick et al. vs. Campbell, &c., 2 Eng. R. 118. Mayor & Alermen of Little Rock vs. State Bank, 3 Eng. R. 227. State Bank vs. War, 3 Eng. R. 506. Knott vs. Clements a. 13 Ark. R. 335.)
The averment in the eclaration that the writing obligatory in question, was mae payable to the plaintiff, Bener, by the style of D. Bener ¿¡ Co., was a material an traversable one, accoring to the ecisions in the cases of Bower et al. vs. State Bank, 5 Ark. 236, an Nicholay et al. vs. Kay, 1 Eng. R. 70. An although, in general, it is the property of the plea of the “general issue,” in any form of action, to eny all the facts set forth in the eclaration, an to put the plaintiff on proof of every essential fact allege by him, it was expressly rule, in the last mentione case, that the plea of non est factum woul not traverse an allegation like this in question, an that that plea putting in issue only the sealing an elivery of the writing obligatory, amitte as true all the other material allegations in the eclaration. From this then it follows that the allegations in question coul only have been specially ha verse. This was the object contemplate by the plea in question; the legal sufficiency only of which, an not its form, or want of verification by affiavit, is brought in question by the emurrer.
As a special traverse, esigne for the enial of only one of the several facts allege in the eclaration, although it containe other matter, an was otherwise objectionable upon special emurrer, before that was abolishe, it properly conclue to the country. An it woul have been equally goo in substance, ha it conclue with a verification, (1 Sauners 103, a. b. n.

This suit was institute by attachment, in the Ranolph Circuit Court. The writ was irecte to the constable of Demeen Township, in Ranolph county, to be by him execute an returne. At the return term the plaintiff move to have the writ amene, so as to show accoring to the facts, that the reason why it was so irecte, was that the offices both of sheriff an' coroner of that county, were vacant at the time of its issuance; an at the same time, upon the groun of the omission of any such reason, the efenant move to quash the writ. The court overrule the motion to amen, an sustaine .the motion to quash.
The act of December 21st, 1846, provies that where the offices of sheriff an coroner of any county are both vacant, an so where there is no coroner, an the sheriff is intereste in the suit, it shall be the uty of any constable of the county, to whom process may be irecte, to execute an return it in the same manner as sheriffs an coroners are require by law to o.
This statute was esigne to facilitate the remey, by substituting another class of executive officers in the place of the sheriff or coroner, whose appropriate uty it is to execute process of the Circuit Courts, in particular cases when those offices are vacant, or the officers themselves are isqualifie; seeing that such vacancies or contingencies may happen, against which the laws cannot provie. The statute is not objectionable as tening to ispense with the office of sheriff or coroner, which the legislature coul not o, but is rather to be commene as an effort on the part of the legislature to guar against any possible failure of justice, for want of the means appointe by law to attain that en.
On the other han, the averse party to be affecte by process issuing from the Circuit Court in civil cases, has the right to insist that such process shall be execute by its proper officer; because he is presume to be a man of substance, personally responsible for his tortious acts, is uner the immeiate control of the court, an whose official bon, in cases where the securities are liable for his acts of commission or omission, furnishes ample inemnity against any abuse of the powers confie to him. An as the authority of the constable to act in the stea of the sheriff, is a special one an limite to the particular case, resting solely on the groun that there is no sheriff or coroner in commission, or none qualifie to act, the fact of such vacancy, or isqualification ought to be suggeste an recite in the writ, which then becomes the officer’s warrant, an a notification to the efenant of his authorityJ;o execute it; an it may well be pleae in abatement of the process that such suggestion or recital is untrue in fact.
But the omission of such recital oes not make voi the writ, which is, in legal contemplation, issue out of the court, presume to know who are its officers; an whenever the power to issue such special process is concee, no goo reason is perceive why it oes not come within the beneficial operation of the statute of amenments. We cannot suppose that the allowance of the amenment, propose to be mae in this case, accoring to the truth of the matter, coul operate to the surprise or injury of the efenant, or eprive him of any substantial right affecting the merits of the suit. On the contrary, its allowance woul conuce to the furtherance of justice. It is fair to presume that if the efenant is injure, it is by the want of authority in the constable to act, an not by means of the omission of the evience of that authority. Accoring to the opinion in Mitchell vs. Conley, at January term, 1853, we conclue that the iscretion of the court in refusing to allow the amenment was not rightly exercise, an for that reason the jugment ought to be reverse, an the cause remane for further proceeings, accoring to law an not inconsistent with this opinion.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The action was ebt, upon jugment renere in another State. The allegation in the eclaration, setting out the jugment, is that the plaintiff, on &c., at a superior court, hel in the county of Talbot, in the State of Georgia, to wit, &c., by the consiera] tion an jugment of sai court, recovere against the efen' ant the sum of one hunre an twenty ollars, for her ebt, as also the further sum of twenty-one ollars an thirty-three cents for her amages, which she ha sustaine by reason of the etention of sai ebt, together with the further sum of ten ollars an fifty cents for her costs in an about sai suit in that behalf expene, whereof the efenant was convict prout patet per recorura, fyc,. The transcript prouce to the court below, upon the issue to the plea of nul tiel recor, shows that, in an action of assumpsit, before the superior court of Talbot county, Georgia, the efenant confesse jugment to the plaintiff for the sum of one hunre an twenty ollars, principal, with interest an costs of suit, an the plaintiff’s attorney signe jugment as follows: “Whereupon, it is consiere by the court that the plaintiff o recover of the efenant the sum of one hunre an twenty ollars, for its principal ebt, an the further sum of twenty-one ollars an thirty-three cents, for its interest, an the further sum of ten ollars an fifty cents, for costs of suit in this behalf expene,” &c. In the authentication of the jugment, the juge, who certifies to the attestation of the clerk, styles himself thus: “I, Alfre Iverson, Juge of the Superior Courts of the Chatahoochee circuit, in sai State, in which circuit is sai county of Talbot,” ec. The court below rejecte the transcript offere in evience, an gave jugment for the efenant.
We think there is no substantial variance between the jugment escribe in the eclaration an that isclose in the transcript. The original recovery, though informal, is, in effect, the same as that escribe by the pleaer in this suit. It is true the cases cite for the plaintiff, among which are, The State Bank vs. Gray, 7 Eng. 760. State Bank vs. Magness, 6 ib. 343, an The State Bank vs. Sherrill, ib. 334, cannot be sai to apply, because in those cases, the recital of the recor was only inucement to the main fact intene to be establishe by it, that is, the institution of a former suit upon the same cause of action, to rebut the presumption arising from lapse of time; an the case of Aams vs. The State for the use of Wallace, at July term, 1853, was ecie upon a like reason. But here the jugment sue upon is necessarily the founation of the action, an it must be concee that a misescription of it, in any material matter, woul be a fatal variance. Yet in such cases the pleaer is not require to escribe the recovery in haec verba, or accoring to its-tenor; but may set it out accoring to its legal effect. The rate of interest allowe by law, is the measure of amages for the breach of a contract to pay money, an whether the action be in form, assumpsit or ebt, the amages, in the shape of interest, follow as a legal consequence upon the ascertainment of the ebt. The jugment is correctly escribe, as to the parties, the' court by whom renere, its ates an amounts, an the eclaration woul therefore seem to be a compliance with the reason-for the rule of pleaing, that a contract must be accurately escribe in orer to ientify the cause of action, for the protection’ of the efenant an as a security against further litigation.
The cause of the rejection, not necessarily appearing, it may be possible that the Circuit Court exclue the transcript offere-in evience, upon the groun that it was not sufficiently authenticate; an so this court might have to hol, were it not for the ecision in Butler vs. Owen, 2 Eng. 369, that where a juge in his attestation, is escribe as juge of the court, it is a sufficient authentication uner the act of Congress, without saying.that he-is the juge, or sole juge; an we are not incline to epart from the preceent there establishe in any ease, where, as in the present instance, there is nothing on the face of the recor auce, from which it coul be inferre that the court was compose of more than one juge or-magistrate.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This suit is brought against Ruell alone, on the joint obligation of Moore an himself. The bon was barre by the statute of limitations, unless the bar was remove by part payment-The efenant pleae the statute of limitations, to which the plaintiff replie generally. Uner this issue, the plaintiff offere evience of such part payment, but the efenant objecte to the evience upon two grouns, first, that the evience offere was-incompetent an inamissible to prove part payment; an secon, that if amissible as evience in other respects, it u as inamissible uner the issue forme. The court overrule his objections an permitte the evience to be given uner the issue, to which the efenant excepte. The same question was again-presente upon a motion for a new trial; an upon exception to-the opinion of the court in refusing, to grant a new trial, the case* is brought here by appeal.
Uner the issue forme it evolve upon the plaintiff to prove-that the cause of action ha accrue within five years next before-the commencement of the suit, which ates from-the filing of the bon, which, uner the statute, is in effect a eclaration, an the issuing of the writ thereon, an the time- when the bon fell ue ; facts to be establishe by the terms of the contract, an the recor evience of the commencement of the suit. If the plaintiff shoul seek to avoi the force an effect of this evience,by show-in§,a new promise, or a new an ifferent point from which the-statute bar commence to run, it is an affirmative matter, the truth of which he must show, an he must also necessarily confess the time at which the bar, by the terms of the contract, commence running. It is then necessarily like matter in confession an avoiance, an shoul be so replie.
Chitty, in his work on pleaing, vol. 1, page 583, says that, when the plea is that the cause of action i not accrue within, &c., the plaintiff coul prove a promise or acknowlegment within.that time, an that the replication might, in such case, be general; but if the time of issuing the first writ in the action were material, it must have been replie specially : an as, that a special replication is, in general, avisable. An upon this istinction as to whether the plea oes, or oes not put the time of issuing the writ in issue, rest all the cases to which the plaintiff has referre, except the cases ecie in Massachusetts Reports, which, upon quite a ifferent state of case, give preference to the proceeing by special replication, an in case the time of issuing the writ is putin issue, make it inispensably necessary to plea specially. Greenleaf, in his work on Evience, vol. 2, sec. 440, page 416, says, “ that if the plaintiff woul avoi the bar by proof of an acknowlegment of the claim, he can only o it uner a special replication of a new promise within the time limite.” An so, also, the exceptions in favor of merchant an merchant, an other exceptions must be replie specially. I. sec. 447-448.
In the case of Trustees vs. Hartfiel, 5 Ark. Rep. 557, the precise question as to whether part payment coul or not be given in evience uner the general replication, was not iscusse; but the court in passing upon the sufficiency of the special replication, hel, that part payment might be given uner the general replication, or might be replie specially.
In Walker vs. Bank Mississippi, 2 Eng. Rep. 504, although the question was not irectly before the court, an for that reason cannot be hel as overruling in express terms the case of Trustees vs. Hartfiel, the court hel that an avoiance of the statute bár by limitation, uner any of the exceptions of the statute, shoul be specially replie. An in Ringgol & Hynson vs. Dunn, 3 Eng. 497, the same rule was hel, when more fully presente, an in still stronger terms. In McClellan vs. The Bank, 7 Eng. 141, where a general replication was file to a plea of the statute of limitation, the recor of a former suit brought on the same cause of action was offere in evience, to bring the case within the exception of the 24th section, Dig. chap. 99, which allows the plaintiff to renew his action within one year next after a jugment of non-suit, it was hel that in orer to let in evience of such former suit, the plaintiff shoul have file a special replication setting up such facts in avoiance of the statute bar.
An in the case of Woos vs. State Bank, 7 Eng. 697, an also in a case still more recently ecie, Bank vs. Conway, January term, 1853, it was hel the safer an more regular practice to require part payment, when relie upon to remove the statute bar, to be specially replie. So that it is not now an open question of practice, but one sactione an approve by this court, both upon soun principles of pleaing an authority: an being, in our opinion, best calculate to present the efinite matter in issue isencumbere from the other facts which might arise uner the general replication, an to limit the proof to it, we o not feel at liberty to epart from it.
Evience of part payment was, therefore, inamissible uner the issue as forme, an shoul have been exclue by the court, inepenent of all consieration of its sufficiency otherwise, which we will next procee to consier.
There were several creits upon the bon, all of which, except one, purporte to be payments mae by Moore, the obligor, not sue. The first payment appears to have been mae by Moore, an, if proven to have been mae at the time it bore ate, woul have remove the statute bar. To prove this the plaintifF offere in evience the following instrument, to-wit: “All of the above creits were mae by me, except the three ollars, an the ates of the creits are correct. Decir. 2, 1850. (signe) Wm. Moore.” An after proving the execution thereof, offere the same, together with the first enorsement of a payment (which purporte to have been mae by Moore) as evience, an the same, against the objections of the efenant, were amitte as evience to the jury.
In orer to prove part payment, as against a co-obligor, it must be shown that such payment was mae at a time when its legal effect woul be to remove the statute bar. Bank vs. Wooy, 5 Eng. 643. Woo vs. Wyls, 6 Eng. 759. The mere enorsement of a creit, as of a ate to effect this, isjnot of itself sufficient: but it must be shown that the enorsement of payment was in fact mae within such time. But where the enorsement is mae by the obligors, or one of them, then proof of that fact will be sufficient evience to permit the enorsement to be rea as evience, as well of the ate as the fact of payment.
After the statute bar has attache no act or amission of one •co-obligor will bin another. Trustees vs. Jenkins, et al. 5 Eng. 108. Such acts an amissions are alone bining upon the party making them. Moore’s amissions, therefore, at the time when they were mae, whether wiitten or verbal, were inamissible as evience against Ruell, an shoul have been exclue. He was not sue, an was clearly a competent witness to prove the fact of such payment, as well as the time when it was mae, whether mae by Ruell or himself.

The petitioner represents that he is the plaintiff in a certain action at law, pening in the Pulaski Circuit Court, now in session, the suit being brought upon a promissory note, which ha been assigne to the plaintiff. That the efenant in the Circuit Court, uring its present term, after having oyer of the instrument sue on, emurre for a variance between the escription of the plaintiff’s name as set out in the eclaration an that isclose by the instrument given on oyer. That the only variance consiste in this, that the plaintiff sue as Anre, an the assignment as fille up, an which was one by the plaintiff’s attorney through mere inavertence was Anrew,it being the same Christian name, accoring as it is spelt in French or English. That the court there has sustaine the emurrer for the suppose variance, an thereupon the plaintiff, by leave of the court, has correcte the mistake in the filling up of the assignment, by inserting Anre instea of Anrew, That the efenant making no further efence, the plaintiff move for jugment for want of a plea; but the court there has, on motion of the efenant, an without any showing being mae therefor, orere the cause to be continue until the next term, thereby enying the petitioner his legal right to have jugment for his ebt; wherefore he prays that a manamus issue against the juge of that court commaning him to set asie the orer of continuance an progress with the cause.
It will be concee that a manamus is the only aequate specific remey for a suitor, where the inferior court refuses to exqrcise its jurisiction, an will not procee to ajuicate a cause pening before it, of which it has cognizance, an where no reason appears for such refusal. The manamus will go to compel the court to act, but not to control its juicial iscretion, by irecting it what jugment to give, or to review the correctness of any ecision mae uring the progress of a cause; else the manamus woul become an inirect substitute for the final review by writ of error or appeal. The proceeing by manamus to compel a Circuit Juge, sitting as a chancellor, to grant an injunction as praye upon any given case presente to him by the bill, an which he has refuse, is in the nature of an. appeal allowe by statute, from some interlocutory orer or ecree of the inferior court.
Accoring to the report of Dixon vs. Feil, 5 Eng. 243, mainly relie on by the petitioner here, it was, as we think, an extreme case to warrant the issuance of a manamus. But amitting, upon the authority of the opinion in that case, that a manamus will lie to control the iscretion of the inferior court in the continuance of a cause, where that iscretion is so palpably abuse as to amount to a enial of justice, the case here is ifferent.
The court below ecie the emurrer. If the petitioner was aggrieve by the ecision, his only remey was to rest upon it an suffer final jugment, which coul be reviewe on a writ of error of appeal. He might then require this court to ecie whether the groun of emurrer was frivolous, or the variance so trifling as to he amenable, without occasioning any surprise or pretext for elay to the efenant. The petitioner acquiesce in the ecision upon the emurrer by making the amenment conformable with iff Accoring to the case presente by the petition, it will be impossible to grant the manamus without reviewing the correctness of that ecision. By the 6th rule of practice for the Circuit Courts, aopte by this court at July term 1848, when a emurrer to a eclaration is sustaine, the emurrant is entitle to a continuance of the cause: an while that rule remains in force, the continuance follows of necessity from the ecision of the court sustaining the emurrer, no matter how erroneous in point of law.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
Bogy an Bonne, two of the efenants here, have pleae in bar of the w'rit of error, that at the May term, 1851, of the Jefferson Circuit Court, at which the jugment brought up by this writ for revision, was renere, the now plaintiff in error praye an appeal from the same jugment, which appeal was uly prosecute, an upon the filing of the transcript, the appeal was ockete; the appellant assigne errors, an these efenants joine therein, an such further proceeings were ha, that the appeal came on to be hear an was submitte to this court for its final ecision an ajuication therein. The plaintiff emurs because the plea fails to show that the appeal is still pening an unetermine, or that it has been prosecute to final jugment in this^ court.
The ecision at July term, 1853, granting the motion of the appellant in the cause referre to by the plea, for leave to is- . miss the appeal after submission, seems to be also ecisive of the question here presente. We are content to say that the right of an appellant to ismiss, at his own costs, an appeal in a common law case, an sue out a writ of error to the same jugment, oes not epen upon the enquiry, whether the appeal was actually pening in.this court, or whether being so pening it ha been prosecute own to submission. We take the istinction to be between those cases where the appeal oes not operate as a superseeas, an those, on the other han, where by operation of law or the act of the suitor, by entering into recognizance, the execution is staye upon the granting of the appeal to this courti If the successful party in the court below, is not hinere by the appeal from having execution, no goo reason is perceive why* the appellant may not ismiss his appeal, at any time before the final ajuication of it, with like effect, as if he ha brought the cause here for revision by writ of error, without superseeas. As the plea fails to show that by the original appeal, the execution of the jugment became suspene, it is not sufficient to bar the present writ of error. The penency of the appeal at the time of suing out the writ of error, might be goo in abatement of the latter proceeing, but woul not be appropriately mae in bar.
In Clay vs. Notrebe, 6 Eng. 631, this court went so far as to refuse to abate a writ of error, upon a plea that an appeal ha been taken in the court below with stay of execution in the same cause. Though the ecision there turne upon the issue mae by the pleaings, whether the appeal ha been in fact pening in this court, the juge elivering this opinion is constraine to think it was an immaterial issue; because where there has been a superseeas, the option of the appellant to abanon his appeal an bring error, is inconsistent with the right of the appellee, uner the statute, to have an affirmance of the jugment, unless the appeal is iligently prosecute; besies, upon appeals taken in the Circuit Court, the stay of execution oes not epen upon the opinion of any court or juge, who, in his iscretion, may think there is probable groun of error, but the suspension is eman-able at the pleasure of the appellant, upon the sole conition of his ability to furnish satisfactory security. But waiving any such consieration it is certainly a much stronger case than the present one.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The first groun of exception in this case is as to the correctness of the ecision of the Circuit Court in sustaining the plaintiffs emurrei'jto the efenants plea in abatement. The matter pleae in abatement was a varíen ce between the writ of summons an a copy of the summons serve upon the efenant. This was no groun for abating the action; at most it was an inirect attack upon the sheriff’s return. If the sheriff ha not, in fact, serve the efenant with a true copy of the writ, an ha falsely returne a vali service, it might become the subject of inquiry upon a irect proceeing against him for a false return, but was no groun whatever for abating the writ. Hughes vs. Martin, 1 Ark. Rep. 386. The plea shoul have been stricken out! There was no necessity for emurring to it, but the objection by emurrer was also goo. An issue-upon it, if tenere, woul, in fact, have settle nothing beyon a question of service.
The secon groun is that after a jugment by efault an upon inquiry of amages before the jury, the efenant was ene the privilege of cross-examining the witnesses introuce to establish the amount of amages sustaine.
In this we think there was error. By failing to appear an. efen, or after having appeare an pleae in abatement, the failure of the efenant to plea in bar, was a confession of the plaintiff’s right to recover amages, an although after such efault or failure to plea, the efenant coul not be hear to eny that some amages were recoverable, still, it was not an amission of any particular amount of amages. If so, there woul be no necessity for a writ of inquiry of amages; an although we have not foun any ajuicate case settling the practice in such cases, we can see no goo reason why the efenant shoul be eprive of his right to cross-examine the witnesses introuce by the plaintiff upon the trial of the inquiry of amages, in orer to show truly what amages ha been sustaine.
In this case we o not know what the question intene to be aske was, nor o we know the range of enquiry inulge upon the examination in chief. The opinion of the court woul seem to eny all cross-examination, irrespective of the nature or extent of the enquiry. Without, therefore, knowing what the particular state of case was, or intening to be unerstoo as eciing that any an all evience, which, uner proper issues forme, woul ten to lessen the amount of amages, may be offere by the efenant upon an inquiry of amages, uner the state of case pre sente we think the Circuit Court erre in refusing the efenant permission to cross-examine the plaintiff’s witnesses. An for this error the jugment of the Circuit Court must be reverse, an the cause remane.",legal_case
1862633,Newton vs. The State Bank,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1848-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker
elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of ejectment, brought by Newton'against the Bank, for the recovery of certain lots of lan in the city of Little Rock.
Newton claime title to the lots as a purchaser at sheriff’s sale, an at the trial of the case prouce a recor showing a jugment against the Bank, an execution uly returne, showing a regular levy on the lots, their avertisement an sale accoring to law, an also, the sheriff’s ee, uly acknowlege an recore.
The Bank (the efenant in execution) then offere to prove by parol evience that the sale to the plaintiff was mae without notice, on a ay subsequent to that state in the sheriff’s return; to the introuction of which the plaintiff objecte, upon the grounhat such evience-was inamissible to contraict the return of the sheriff, an the recitals in the ee in that particular. But the Circuit Court overrule the objection, an permitte such evience to be given to the jury; to which the plaintiff excepte. An the amission of this evience over the objection of the plaintiff, presents the only important question to be etermine.
The act of the Legislature, which requires the sheriff to recite the names of the parties, the ate of the writ an of the jugment, together with a escription of the time, place,, an manner of the sale; an which makes such recitals evience of the facts so recite, was intene by the Legislature to supersee the necessity for proucing the recor, from which such recitals were mae, as a matter of convenience, an to furnish evience of the authority uner which the officer acte, as well as the manner in which he ha execute his authority in the ee itself. Not that the recitals shoul be conclusive evience of the facts recite; for that woul exclue all inquiry into the authority uner which the sheriff acte; but that it shoul be legal, competent evience, until falsifie by evience of a higher an more authentic character. The acts of an- officer one in obeience to the law, when require to be certifie an returne, form a part of the recors of the case in which they are ha; Lawson v. Main, 4 Ark. 186; an being part of the recors, the return, as well as the execution an the jugment, imports absolute verity, an is alike conclusive as the jugment, upon the rights of the parties to the recor. It is upon this principle that this court, in the case of Jamison v. May, 6 Eng. 374, hel parol evience inamissible to contraict a sheriff’s return upon a writ of summons. An this ecision of ours is fully sustaine by numerous authorities, an ajuge cases, in several of which the question arose uner circumstances strikingly similar to the case before us. Thus, in the case of Love & Williams v. Powell, 5 Ala. 58; in a suit to try title, where the plaintiff claime uner a sheriff’s ee, the court hel parol evience inamissible to contraict the sheriff’s return, an in conclusion the court sai, “ Our conviction is that the ee is conclusive an cannot be impeache on a collateral issue, except for frau in the execution of the ee, when*the process uner which the lan was sol is supporte by an existing unsatisfie jugment.”
In the case of Jackson vs. Roberts, 7 Wen. 86, the sheriff’s ee escribe the sale as having been mae uner execution in favor of Hill & Stubbins. The efenant sought to isprove the truth of this recital bypai’ol evience. The court sai, the question is “Can that part of the sheriff’s ee be contraicte by parol evience, which sets forth the writ uner which the sale was mae ?” The court then refers to, an approves its former ecisions in the cases of Jackson vs. Vanenhayen, 17, John. 167, an Jackson vs. Croy, 12 John. R. 427, in which parol evience was hel inamissible to contraict a sheriff’s ee, an after commenting upon the effects of a ifferent rule, the court conclue its opinion with the following remarks : “We see no formiable mischief likely to result from the operation0of such a principle. A party who may be injure by the mistake of a sheriff can have relief by a summary application to the courts uner whose authority the sheriff acts, or through the meium of a court of equity ; an it is much better that he shoul be confine to this moe of reress, than to rener all titles erive uner juicial sales oubtful, an subject to be efeate by allowing the written instruments, by which they are evience, to be attacke collaterally by parol evience.”
Chief Justice Sharkey says, in Minor vs. Select Men of Natchez, 4. S & Mar. 619. “The purchaser is not put upon enquiry as to the regularity of the jugment. In the official character of the sheriff an his general power erive from that character, purchasers have a guaranty that they will be protecte in their title.” Savage Ch. J., in the case of Jackson vs. Calwell, 1 Cow. Rep. 644, sai, “It may therefore be consiere as settle law, that a bona fie purchaser at a sheriff’s sale acquires a vali title as against the efenant in the execution, unless it is not only voiable but absolutely voi.”
The case of Trigg vs. Lewis, 3 Littell 131, lays own the general rule, an shows that it is peculiarly applicable to sheriff’s returns. The court says, “ It is a general rule that the acts of a ministerial officer, as far as the rights of the parties affecte thereby are concerne, must be taken as true, when brought into contest collaterally, an can only be impeache by a irect proceeing, such as makes the officer a party. This rule is peculiarly applicable to returns of sheriffs on process. Hence this court ecie in the case of Hornback vs. Smith, that the return of a sheriff on the writ of habere facias possessionem is conclusive. It is therefore clear that it was not competent for the efenant to aver an prove any thing against the return of the officer in this instance; such as the proof tenere by the replication, that the lan was not in fact sol, an that the proceeings relative thereto were not real.”
The ecisions are irectly in point, an may be consiere as conclusively settling the questions; First, that the return of the sheriff must be consiere an treate as part of the recors in the case; an seconly, that parol evience is inamissible to contraict it. The oor for re-investigation is close upon the parties to the recor. It is not to be questione by them; an this because they are parties to the recor, an have ay in court; an it is not only their interest but their uty to look to the regularity of the proceeings, an when passe without objection they may be sai in effect, to have receive the approval of the parties. An so with regar to the execution of final process. It is execute for their benefit by the officer of the law, an uring the whole time up to the sale an acknowlegment of the ee, they have ay in court, an it is their uty to see that the sale is conucte fairly; at least, if they shoul fail to o so, they have but little cause for complaint. The purchaser, a stranger, who ha no agency in proucing the irregularity, an no power to control or irect the action of the officer in any respect, who has bought in goo faith, an acquire a legal title, vali an regular upon the face of his ee, shoul be protecte in that title against those parties to the recor, who have stoo by an-without objection, suffere him to pay the purchase money, the benefit of which they receive, an receive a ee, sanctione an approve by the court without objection from,them. Uner such circumstances, as between the purchaser an the parties to the recor, it woul be wrong to suffer them, in a collateral proceeing, to introuce parol evience to contraict the recor evience of the purchaser’s title.
This question has been substantially settle by the ecision of this court in the case of The State Bank vs. Nolan an others; ecie at the last term of this court, where it is hel that after the purchaser has acquire title by sheriff’s ee approve an orere to be recore, at no subsequent time, after the lapse of that term, shall his title be questione for frau, accient, or mistake, or for any irregularity in the proceeings, which must as of necessity (in most instances) arise out of one or other of these causes, upon motion, or in a proceeing at common law. But where the proceeings were such as, in the first instance, to vest in him a legal title to the estate therein conveye, or, in the language of the court, when elivering its opinion in that case, “ When his legal title is perfect, an when the valiity of the title itself is assaile for frau, accient or mistake, arising out of the irregularity of the proceeings, or the acts of the parties, he has a right to be hear before a tribunal that can rightfully exercise jurisiction in such matters, with power an process to bring all the parties in interest before it, to put them upon their consciences to answer; to cancel the ee; to restore possession ; an to awar equitable compensation.”
How far, or uner what circumstances the return of the sheriff an the recitals in the ee may be questione in a irect proceeing in chancery, for that purpose, or where frau is allege in the execution of the ee, we are not now calle upon to ecie; because, in the case before us, no offer was mae to introuce evience to prove frau. It is true that proof that the sale was mae after the ay fixe by law, an without notice, might, when taken in connection with other evience, conuce to prove frau. An if the efenant ha propose this in connection with other evience, for that purpose, the question woul have arisen as to its amissibility in a common law court- upon a collateral issue. But the avowe object of the efenant was to falsify an isprove the return of the sheriff, as to the time of the sale an the notice given. This, we have sai, coul not be one. An upon examination of the authorities cite by counsel, in which parol evience was amitte to isprove the return of the officer, it will be foun that in Tennessee such evience was allowe to prove a want of notice, because the statute of that State eclare the sale voi, without notice. An so also in Kentucky, as to the quantity of lan to be sol. The statute forbi the sale of more lan than woul pay the ebt. This was a violation of a prohibitory, not a irectory statute. In the case in 5 Blackf. 260, the strongest, case referre to by counsel, the evience was amitte to prove a frau. An none of them are applicable to the state of case before us. , The counsel has, in an ingenious argument, eneavore to bring them to bear upon this case, by assuming that if the sale shoul be proven to be on a ay subsequent to the first ay of the return term, it woul be voi, because the execution was not then in force, an conferre no power on the sheriff to sell, an that parol evience was amissible to prove the sale voi, as hel in Tennessee, Kentucky an Iniana. This groun- was, we apprehen, taken uner a misapprehension of the statute. It is true that the statute irects the sale to be mae on the first ay of the return term, but makes the writ returnablé on the secon ay of the term, Dig. Ch. 67, sec. 9; anthis, as appears from the efenant’s own evience, was theay on which the sale was in fact mae, although returne by the sheriff as mae on the first ay of the term. A sale mae on the return ay of the writ is vali. Blaisall vs. Sheife, 5 New. 11, 201. Tayloe vs. Gaskins, 1 Dev. 295.
The sale then was not voi for want of power in the sheriff to sell, an as regars the irregularity in selling on a ay ifferent from that irecting sheriff’s sales an without notice, these are irregularities which arise in the exercise of power conferre. A eparture by the officer from the statutory irections, as to the manner of executing his power, oes not affect the title of a bona fie purchaser at sheriff’s sale. This has been so repeately ecie by this court that it may now be hel as settle law. Aamson et al. vs. Cummins a. 5 Eng. 541. Byers & McDonal, vs. Fowler,et al. 7 Eng. 218. Whiting & Slark, vs. Beebe, et al. 7 Eng. 421.
But even if a oubt coul arise as to the correctness of these ecisions in orinary cases, it is very questionable whether this case woul come uner the rule as lai own by the authorities most favorable to the efenant’s case; for the statute in regar to sales mae after the property has been regularly avertise an bi off, an where the purchaser refuses to pay the sum bi, irects a re-sale, but is silent both as to the time an manner of sale. No oubt the officer may, on the same ay, re-offer the property for sale, an then there woul be no necessity for notice, but suppose, as is no oubt the case in most instances, in counties where there is much litigation, that the sheriff shoul not fin time after selling, to hunt up the purchaser an make his settlement with him, or upon a refusal of the purchaser to pay the sum bi, to re-sell the property at once. It is evient that in many instances a large number of sales woul be postpone by sham bis, procure to be mae by irresponsible biers, an if the sheriff is not allowe to sell the property on another ay, it woul result in incalculable elay an mischief. When, however, he comes to fix the ay, the law is silent both as to time, place an notice. Shoul he refer to the statute he coul erive no ai from it as a preceent, for it was certainly not intene to wait until the first ay of the next succeeing term ; nor as regars notice, that thirty ays shoul be allowe ; but on the contrary of this the statute is silent, an by its other provisions seems to contemplate a summary sale, by which, however, the efenant an the plaintiff are both protecte against ultimate loss, by holing the first bier responsible over for any loss which may arise, in case the property shoul not sell for as much at the secon as it i at the first sale. Thus the first purchaser is mae to stan between the efenant an loss occasione by his refusal to pay the price for which the property sol at the appointe time by law an upon regular notice.
In the case uner consieration the efenant, by her attorney, was the first bier, to whom the property was struck off, at a sale amitte to be in all respects regular. Upon a refusal of the attorney to pay the sum bi, the property, as appears by the sheriff’s return, was thereupon at once re-sól, an as the efenant contens, it was sol the next ay after. The secon sale then was the result of the act of the efenant, who became, uner the statute, responsible for any loss that might accrue by reason of the secon sale. If loss, then ha accrue, it woul have been his own fault, an upon his own responsibility. Bnt in truth no loss in this instance accrue; for the property sol for as much at the secon, as it i at the first sale, an consequently no injury resulte from the secon sale.
If the officer, uninfluence by the conuct of the purchaser, ha abuse his official power to the prejuice of the rights of the Bank, he is responsible to her for amages, or if, by the combine action of the officer an the purchaser a frau has been perpetrate to the inj ury of the Bank, she must apply to a court competent to affor relief; but in a common law court the valiity of a sheriff’s ee cannot be questione by parol evience touching irregularities, not affecting the power an authority in the officer to sell an execute such ee.
There is no oubt but that the Circuit Court erre in permitting parol evience to be given to the jury to contraict the return of the sheriff an the recitals in the ee. An for this error the jugment of the Pulaski Circuit Court must be set asie an reverse, an the cause remane for further proceeings to be ha accoring to law, an not inconsistent with this opinion.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
In February, 1845, the intestate, Spears, exhibite his bill against Taylor, alleging that in the year 1834, they forme a partnership in a saw mill, an that in the year 1836, they also entere into a mercantile partnership in Jefferson county. That the partnership in the mill was issolve some time in the summer of 1837, an that the mercantile partnership was continue until about the month of January, 1839. That profits were realize from both the concerns, which were woun up by Taylor, who ha charge of the books an receive the avails. The bill praye iscovery an account, an a ecree for the balance ascertaine to be ue to the complainant.
Taylor answere, that there was a partnership in two saw mills, one in a water mill commencing in 1834, an the other in a steam mill. That the steam mill was put into operation about the first of January, 1836, an some time uring the spring of the same year the water mill was washe away. That there was also a partnership in a store, which continue from some time in the year 1836 until August, 1837. That no profits were realize from either business, of which he exhibite accounts. That he ha pai ebts of the concerns beyon what assets he ha receive. That he was always reay an willing to settle, but complainant ha left the State, an it was his own fault that there ha been no settlement. He set up by way of answer the statute of limitations of three years as a bar to the relief.
Subsequently, Taylor file a cross bill re-asserting his answer with an enlarge statement of the business of the several partnerships, an of other transactionsbetween Spears anhimself, claiming a balance ue to him by Spears, on a full settlement, praying an account an ecree. Among the unsettle matters between them, he represente that, as the agent of Spears, who ha left the country, he sol a tract of lan belonging to Spears, an for the procees of which, he ha given him creit on account of what Spears owe him. That Spears, who was insolvent, ha recovere jugment against him on the law sie of the court, for the procees of the lan in question; an he praye that this jugment might be enjoine an brought into the account to be state between them.
Spears answere, amitting the partnerships in the two mills an the store. He again gave his own version of the partnership transactions. He enie that he was insolvent. He insiste that the transaction about the sale of the lan ha no connection with the partnership business. An as to some items charge against him by Taylor, an which he allege were transactions outsie of the partnerships, he relie in his answer on the statute of limitations. He answere, that his action against Taylor to recover the procees of the lan was pening, an no jugment ha then been renere in it.
The two suits being at issue, by replications to the answers, both parties proceee to take epositions! At a subsequent term, the court orere that Spears esist from proceeing to execute the jugment at law, which he ha in the meantime obtaine against Taylor; an the master in chancery was irecte to take an state an account of the matters in ispute between the parties. Aitional epositions were taken before the master, an upon the coming in of his report, it was excepte to by Spears upon various grouns. At a subsequent term the eath of Spears being suggeste, his aministrator was substitute, an the cause was submitte upon the exceptions to the master’s report. The court being of opinion that neither party was entitle to any relief, ismisse the original an cross bill at the costs of the respective complainants, from which ecree both parties appeale.
Such is a brief outline of the voluminous recor of this cause ; the etails of which are not material to the etermination of the question, which we unerstan to be involve in the cause, an the only one upon which we can suppose the ecision of the court below to have turne.
In Tatam vs. Williams, 3 Hare, 347, ecie in 1844, an the latest English case we meet with on this subject, the bill of a surviving partner seeking an account of partnership transactions, brought thirteen years after issolution by eath of one of the partners, was ismisse on the groun of lapse of time. The ¡Yíce Chancellor sai, “ In this court there is irect an very high authority for the proposition that a court of equity will not, after six years acquiescence, unexplaine by circumstances, or countervaile by acknowlegment, ecree an account between a surviving partner, an the estate of a ecease partner,” citing Barber vs. Barber, 18 Vesey 286. Ault vs. Goorich, 4 Russell 430, an Briges vs. Mitchell, Gilbert's Eq. Rep. 224, an those cases were ahere to, notwithstaning the remarks of Lor Brougham an the apparent grouns of the ecision by the House of Lors in the case of Robinson vs. Alexaner, 8 Bligh 352.
It is to be collecte from the case of Ray vs. Bogart, 2 John. Cases 432, that, assuming eleven years as the perio of elay unaccounte for, after issolution of a partnership, a bill seeking an examination an settlement of the accounts will be ismisse where the statute of limitations is not pleae or insiste on in the answer, though Juge Kent, who iffere from a majority of the court of errors, oubte whether the statute of limitations applies where there is a mutual trust as between partners, an if it i, he thought the efence is waive unless insiste on.
The circumstance that the estate of a ecease partner is sought to be charge is one that may often influence a court of chancery in refusing reief, so far as that may epen upon iscretion, because of the suppose inability of the representatives of the ecease partner, to conten on equal terms with the survivor san the statute of the State limiting claims against the estates of ecease persons, unless presente for probate an allowance within two years from the grant of letters, woul no oubt have a material bearing upon cases of that escription, where the statute of limitation has any application in chancery. But the ecisions are not confine to cases where either of the partners ha ecease. Where the statute applies in chancery, the enial of the relief oes not epen on that circumstance. In Diier vs. Davison, 2 Barbour Chy. Rep. 482, this subject was consiere, an upon the strength of the previous ajuge cases in New York, relief was enie on a bill for account, where there ha been no ealings within six years, an the complainant an efenant were in full life. The case there was embarrasse by the exception in the statute of accounts between merchant an merchant. The statute of this State, in force 20th March, 1839, oes not retain this exception, but enacts in lieu of it, that in all cases of mutual ealings, the statute runs from the last item prove; an it seems to be settle in Englan, as well as in this country, that the accounts between partners respecting the profits or transactions of the firm, are not hel to be within the saving in favor of accounts between merchant an merchant, where that exception exists.
In express trusts, where one hols the legal title an another has the beneficial interest, an which, as between the trustee an ■cestui que trust are recognizable only in a court of equity, so long-as the trust create by the ee of the parties or the appointment of law, is recognize to exist, an for any purpose remains to be execute, the statute of limitations, as such, or the analogous bar by lapse of time or staleness of the eman can have no application. But implie trusts often epening on parol proof, which have to be establishe as well as enforce by the ai of a court of equity, an originating in some wrongful an frauulent act of the party sought to be charge as trustee, which is a isavowal oí the relation, o come within the reason an policy of the statute. In such cases the party seeking to establish the trust, is suppose to have some remey, though not an aequate one at law, against the trustee committing the wrongful act or conversion, upon which the law raises the trust by implication; an where the party seeking reress is apprise of his rights, or if they be frauulently conceale from him, whenever the frau is iscovere, or might reasonably have become known, he must assert his rights in equity within the perio limiting the analogous remey at law, unless he come within some saving or exception. Else by merely going into another forum, he coul evae the policy of the statute limiting actions atlaw. Conceing then that there is a quasi trust or confience in the ealings between partners, it is not that kin of technical trust cognizable only in equity, an which exclues the operation of the statute. With equal reason such a claim to exemption from the statute coul be mae in all cases of bailment, agency an the various confiential relations in the transaction of business. Such is recognize to be the law in this country in numerous cases, among which, the leaing one is that of Kane vs. Bloogoo, 7 John. Chy. 89, an the authorities will be foun collecte on the subject in Murray's amr. vs. Mason's amr. 8 Porter 211. See also Baker vs. Bile, Balwin's Rep. 418.
In this case the partnerships were issolve by the abanonment of Spears in 1837. It oes not appear that any settlement was attempte or that either party sought it. No circumstance of accient, frau or concealment is allege, which woul now entitle the parties to the favor of equity. The bills are purely for an account an for iscovery in ai of it. The bulk of the business was transacte ten years before the filing of the bill, an there oes not appear to have been any transaction within eight years. Then recurring to the statute which limits all actions of accounts, assumpsit, or ebt upon contracts not in writing, to three years; actions on promissory notes an contracts in writing not uner seal, to five years; upon writings obligatory an j ugments to ten years; an the statute of non-claim against estates before averte to, the policy which pervaes it is sufficiently inicate; an where the statute applies courts of equity accoring to these rules, as well as courts of law ought to aminister it. The case of McGuire vs. Ramsay, 4 Eng. 518, oes not necessarily conflict with the point actually ecie'here, that the relation between co-partners oes not create such a trust as will exempt a bill for a mere account an settlement, from the operation of the statute, but it maybe oubte whether that case i not go a great way in establishing an implie trust after lapse of time.
For the same reasons that a efenant in chancery is not require in all cases to avail himself of the efence of limitation, by way of answer or by plea, as at law, but may emur where a efence, which the complainant by his allegations has anticipate without avoiing, appears to exist on the face of the bill, the objection that the claim is a stale one may be taken at the hearing, an when the proofs isclose such a case, the court may of its own motion eny relief to parties who have slept upon their rights; because while courts of chancery may have a iscretion to etermine the rights of parties seeking an ajuication, notwithstaning the lapse of time where the facts are not ispute or susceptible of being clearly ascertaine; the reason why they refuse relief in accorance with a statute by which they are not expressly boun, is the fear of oing injustice, an the inability to affor relief, where the sources of testimony have become obscure or lost by lapse of time.
The present case is peculiarly one of that escription. The bar of the statute set up by Taylor in his answer, must be consiere as waive by his cross bill, which eprive Spears of any election to ismiss the bill, an the court was free to settle the controversy between the parties, if the proofs gave assurance that it coul be one with any egree of certainty or safety. But it appears that all the partnerships were mere parol agreements an as to the very terms an stipulations of which at the outset the answers of the parties themselves raically an irreconcilably.- In the two mills an the store, Taylor was in partnership with ifferent persons, an Spears was let in as a sort of sub-partner with Taylor in his half interest in these concerns. No regular books of account were kept, an of such as were kept some are lost. The master i not attempt to take any account of the mercantile transactions. The mill accounts are complicate by the loss of rafts an isputes between the parties concerning receipts for lumber an isbursements for expenses, an for the hire an support of hans; an epening for eluciation upon the uncertain testimony of witnesses, who as they are competent by having no interest in the transactions, ha no motive to unerstan or recollect them with accuracy.
If injustice has been one by turning both parties out of court, it is to be regrette only as the result of their own laches, an for the reason that it cannot be clearly known whether injustice has been one, we conclue that the chancellor in refusing relief to either party, was influence by just views of the law an his uty.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of assumpsit by Hill, McLean & Co , against the appellee. The eclaration contains the common counts for goos sol an elivere, money pai, for interest an on account state. The only evience auce to sustain the action was the eposition of a witness, taken in New Orleans, who states, “that the account marke A, hereto annexe, showing a balance ue to Hill, McLean & Co., of five hunre an forty-seven ollars an fifty cents, by Emon P. Rucker is correct;” an he also annexe to his eposition the invoices marke B, an three hills of laing marke 1, 2 an 3. The same witness further state that it is customary for commission merchants to charge eight per cent, interest on open accounts. The ac count exhibite shows the total amount of ebits, as state by the witness, but there are no creits appearing, so as to make that amount a balance, or from which any recognition of the correctness of the account by the efenant coul be inferre. The exhibit B consists of bills of goos, some of which appear to have been consigne to A. Hays, Napoleon, for account of E. P. Ruck-er, Rucker’s Laning, Arkansas river; an another portion to J. A. McAlister & Co., Nashville, for account of E. P. Rucker. The copies exhibite of the bills of laing, show that certain goos were shippe by Hill, McLean & Co., at New Orleans, some of them on the Cotton Plant, marke “E. P. Rucker,” an consigne to Hays, at Napoleon, an another portion on the Harry Hill, marke “M. L. Rucker, Murphreesboro, Tennessee,” consigne to McAlister & Co., at Nashville. In the account, the items are charge uring the month of July 1847, the invoices are without ate, an the bills of laing are ate in November an December, 1847. The plaintiffs also prove, by another witness, that the efenant, Rucker, was a planter on the Arkansas river in the year 1847. This being all the evience in the case, the court instructe the jury, that they shoul fin for the efenant, unless the plaintiffs have proven either that the efenant orere the goos, or that he receive them, an that the shipment of the goos an taking bills of laing therefor, in the manner shown by the eposition referre to, is not sufficient evience of a receipt of them by the efenant, but there must be proof of an actual receipt of the goos by him, if they were not orere.
Such, in substance, was the instruction given, the propriety of which is not questione; but it appears that the court, in response to an- enquiry from the jury, tol them, that the eposition was evience, but not sufficient for them to fin a verict for the plaintiffs, who shoul have prove that the efenant ha either orere or receive the goos: an it is argue, for the appellants that such- charge, in- the terms given,, was- an invasion by the court below of the province of the jury.
Accoring to the settle practice in this State, the court has no power to orer a peremptory non-suit, Martin & Van Horne vs. Webb, 5 Ark. 72. Ringo vs. Fiel, 1 Eng. 48, but the practice has prevaile for the court, sitting as a jury, or the jury uner instructions from the court, to fin as in case of non-suit, which is a etermination of the case upon the merits as presente by the evience, a bar to any future action for the same cause, an to which error lies, Fagan vs. Faulkner, 5 Ark. 161. Cocke vs. Brogan, ib. 694. Palmer & Southmay vs. Ashley & Ringo, 3 ib. 75, though the correctness of it was oubte in Goorich vs. Fritz, 4 Ark. 525, an in Carr vs. Crain, 2 Eng. 249, repeate in The State use &c., vs. Roper, 3 ib. 493, the court sai, “ The correct motion is to instruct the jury that if the evience has not prove a matter necessary to be proven, they must fin for the efenant,” though in the two last cases mentione, the istinction oes not appear to be notice, that to orer a non-suit is to say the jury shall not pass on the evience, while the letter authority is that the court has not this power, an that the plaintiff has the right to have the jury pass on his case, an to be conclue if he will by the jugment, which being final entitles him to a revision in the appellate court. But to instruct the jury to fin as in, case of non-suit, is only the opinion of the court.that the plaintiff has faile to make out his case in evience, an so far from taking the case from the jury is every way favorable to the plaintiff, because it is analogous to a emurrer to evience, where all-legitimate presumptions of fact are to be inulge in favor of the evience.
There is therefore no real iscrepancy between the cases averte to, an they all ten to establish, that however angerous it may be for a efenant to ask the court to instruct the jury to' fin as in case of non-suit, or that the plaintiff has faile to make out his case in evience, it is no assumption of power for the court-to give such an instruction, the only question being whether it was properly given. In this case the real truth may be, that the efenant was resisting payment of a just eman, an that the apparent inconsistencies in the eposition coul have been reconcile an any efect of proof supplie by further testimony; but accoring to the case presente on the recor, the jury coul not-have been justifie by the evience in fining a verict for the plaintiffs, an consequently the expression of such an opinion by the court was erroneous. The statement of the witness who epose that the account exhibite showing a certain balance ue the plaintiffs from the efenant was correct, might have been honestly mae, as appearing to him from the books of the plaintiffs; but it cannot be stretche to mean that the witness was personally cognizant of the transactions about which he testifie, or to amount to proof that the efenant, not shown to have receive the goos, ha orere or bargaine for them, so as to be1come chargeable for their value by the elivery of them to a carrier.

The complainant by his bill alleges that the efenants an himself entere into an agreement of co-partnership for the purpose of erecting a am an saw mill, upon a certain tract- of lan then belongiug to the government, but which was to be entere by them in tKeir joint names, each partner avancing his equal portion of the purchase money, All the partners were to ai in constructing the mill, an an account was to be kept of the work one, materials furnishe, an money expene by each. The complainant being a mill-wright, was to o an superinten that portion of the work. That in case either partner shoul become issatisfie by the time the mill was put into operation, or before, he shoul not then be consiere a partner any longer, but shoul be pai what was ue him by the concern. That the parties proceee with the erection of the mill an am, in which the complainant was engage uring several months, when he iscovere that one of the efenants, with the privity of the other, ha gone to the istrict lan office, an claime an obtaine a pre-emption right to the tract of lan on which the mill was situate, thereby preventing for the term of one year, the entry of it, pursuant to their agreement, an the efenants then refuse to recognize him as a partner, an force him to abanon the work. That besies his labor bestowe in assisting to erect the mill, he ha expene various small sums of money of which an account was exhibite. That he was entitle as a partner, to one-thir share in the mill, an praye for iscovery, an an account an settlement of the partnership affairs, that the property might be sol an the procees ivie amongst the partners accoring as the amount ue to each might be ascertaine.
The efenants, in their answer, profess to annex an setforth by way of exhibit, an account of the labor an money expene by them in erecting the mill, an also an account of moneys owing to them by the complainant, but no such exhibits appear in the transcript before us. But in orer to reach what seems to be the only question presente in the case, it will be sufficient to state, that the answer an the epositions taken on both sies isclose substantially the following facts. That there was a verbal agreement to erect the mill an enter thelan in partnership, though iffering in several respects from that allege by the complainant. That the complainant i expen some money, an work at intervals an inifferently well uring several months. That the efenants loge in the lan office, a claim to a preemption right upon the tract in question, not with any esign to efrau the complainant, but to prevent any other person from entering it, an until such time as the partners coul spare the money to enter it, an that the transaction was so explaine to the complainant. • That the complainant quit work an abanone the partnership without any just cause for issatisfaction an against the wishes of the efenants,, who requeste him to continue. That the work one by the complainant was of some value to the efenants, who remaine in possession of the property, an when the complainant left the mill in an unfinishe state, hire another mill-wright an went on to complete it.
Upon the hearing, the court below ismisse the bill for want of equity, an upon the whole case, the appellant has no right to complain of the ecree, so far as it enies to him any right as a partner to an interest in the specific property. But it oes appear that something is ue to him from the efenants, or at least, that he is equitably entitle to have an account taken, an a ecree in his favor, for what may be foun to be justly ue, an upon the statement of such account, both parties will be at liberty to make proof of their emans.
The abanonment by the complainant of the unertaking worke a issolution of the copartnership, but there was nothingin his conuct from which any frauulent esign to obtain an unfair avantage of his copartners, which woul work a total forfeiture of his rights, can be inferre. He left them in possession of the partnership property, an the avails of his labor in an unfinishe, but not useless state. Unlike the efenant in Harvey vs. Howell, 5 Ark. 270, whose conuct the court then thought a fit subject for animaversion, the complainant here i not engage in any business hostile to the interests of the partnership, or o anything inconsistent with it beyon his capricious abanonment of the unertaking, which i not hiner them from prosecuting it to completion!
The cause will be remane with instructions to the court below to irect an account to be taken of the amount ue to the complainant for his work an services, materials furnishe or money expene about the erection of the am an mill, supposing him to have been employe by the efenants for that purpose, an after eucting therefrom in the way of compensation such amount as he may have receive from the efenants, to ecree that they pay him the resiue, if any, which he will take in lieu of any interest he might have ha in the partnership property, or the profits arising from it.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The efenant was inicte in the Yan Burén Circuit Court for an assault an battery, allege to have been committe on the person of one William York. At the foot of the inictment there ■is the following enorsement: “ This inictment is preferre upon the testimony of the party injure, who was summone on presentation an by orer of the gran jury.
JOHN H. BYERS, Pro. Atto.”
The question is, was this enorsement sufficient uner the 87th sec. Dig. ch. 52. That section provies that “ No inictment for any trespass on the person or property of another, not amounting to felony, shall be preferre, unless the name of the prosequtor be enorse thereon, except where the same is preferre on the information or knowlege of one or more of the gran jury, or on the information of some public officer in the necessary ischarge of his uty, or on the' testimony of some witness other than the party injure, in which case a statement of the fact shall be mae at the en of the inictment an signe by the attorney for the State.”
The enorsement in this case falls short of a compliance with the statute. The fact that the witness was summone to testify, was not sufficient to supersee the necessity of his enorsement as prosecutor. If the party assaulte was permitte thus to evae the statute, he woul rarely incur the responsibility of paying the costs of the prosecution, in the event of an acquittal, by enorsing himself as prosecutor, when by procuring himself to be summone, he coul by his testimony put on foot a prosecution intene to gratify his private resentment without incurring such responsibility.
It may sometimes be the case that the party injure is the only witness by whom the offence can be proven, an that, because of his refusal to become prosecutor, the offener may go unpunishe; but we apprehen that cases of this kin will be rare. The language of the enorsement is somewhat peculiar; it is that “the inictment is foun on .the testimony of the party injure, who was summone upon presentation, an by orer of the gran jury.” This language strongly implies that the gran jury were informe, or ha knowlege of the fact, an upon such information summone the witness. If such was the fact an their information was sufficient to satisfy them, that an inictment shoulabe preferre, the enorsement woul have been sufficient, if it ha simply state the fact that it was foun upon the information of one or more of the gran jurors. But in the case before us, it is expressly state that the inictment is foun upon the testimony of the party injure, an the resiue of the enorsement is intene to show how an uner what circumstances he was brought before the gran jury. The enorsement was clearly insufficient, an the motion to quash properly sustaine.

The appellant was inicte, trie, convicte an sentence to eath in the Inepenence Circuit Court for the murer of Hiram Payne, a white man. He appeale to this court, an his senténcé having been respite by the Circuit Court, uner the provisions of the statute, a sufficient time to allow him to make an application to a juge of this court for a suspension of his execution until his appeal coul be hear here, that orer was mae upon an inspection of a transcript of the recor an proceeings in accorance with his prayer.
From the bills of exceptions it appears that, on the ay before the killing, the appellant an his master, Benjamin Watson,ha a conversation, in which the slave talke improperly to his master,' an that at night when he returne from ploughing, he brought, a club in with him. That after supper he sat out upon the yar fence with the same in his han, an also picke up another stick, which he took to his quarters an set up at the oor, carrying the first name stick into the house. That in the course of the evening, an after supper, his master went into a room where the-school boys an hirelings were, whereupon the appellant left his own room an went to the chimney corner of the welling house. That about the mile of the night the appellant walke out into the yar carrying a fire torch, an the stick that he ha brought from the fiel, in his han. Upon returning to his quarters he tol his wife they were going to take him, but that he woul not be taken by bis master or any boy else, an that he woul knock the first man own that came into the room. ■ The next morning, the appellant went to mill an returne, an then bunle up his clothes an took them away. He then got some tubs, as he was orere to o, an went to the Woos for some hoop poles, as he was orere to o by a witness, who was oing some work for Watson, the master, an neee the hoop poles for the work in progress. It woul seem thats about this perio of time, Mrs. Watson, the wife of the master, ha sent a message to her husban, who was at the school house, to the effect that the appellant ha run away, an it appearing that while Watson, the master, was on the way from the school house to his welling, whither he was going in consequence of receiving such a message from his wife, he met the appellant coming from the woos with some hoop poles an an axe in his hans. It appears that then “Watson an others avance towars the (appellant) at the request of Watson, an for the purpose, as expresse by Mr. Watson of correcting” him. Who these others were an how they happene to be with Watson oes not appear. It appears, however, that when Watson an these others approache to the appellant, that he retreate, but that they overlook him in the roa an orere him to lay own his axe, an he refuse, an sai that he woul not be w’hippe by Watson, or any boy else, an that he woul kill the first man that attempte to take him, an that he then walke on, an Watson an the men after him. In a short time he stoppe again an was conversing with Watson, but what was sai oes not appear. At this point of time “Hiram Payne, the slain, walke rapily by the witness, from behin the witness, being behin the boy an the company, having in his hans a piece of pine plank. That Payne, the ecease, walke irectly up to Watson an Austin, the appellant, an rew his stick upon Austin. That Austin stoo with his axe rawn as Payne rew his stick upon Austin. That Austin ware off the blow of Payne with his left arm, an with his right struck Payne with the axe. That Payne was hit with the whole ege of the axe on his hea, the cut penetrating to the brain, an that Payne ie the Saturay afterwars.”
Upon the trial so much of the evience was objecte to as relate to matters that transpire the ay before the homipie, upon the groun of its isconnection with that principal fact, an irreleyan cy to the issue. It is certainly true as a general rule, both in civil an criminal cases, that the evience must be confine to the point in issue; an in criminal cases there is perhaps a greater necessity, if possible, than in civil proceeings to enforce the rule: but in neither class of cases oes this rule exclue all evience that oes not bear irectly upon the issue; on the contrary, all evience is amissible which tens to prove it, an no facts are forbien to be shown, except such as are incapable of afforing any reasonable presumption or inference in eluciation of the matters involve in the issue. In this case the line of efence taken, an which the State ha the right to anticipate, was that the homicie amounte to no more than manslaughter. The presen ce or absence of malice was therefore an essential matter of enquiry. To establish it the State was not boun to rely exclusively upon the malice that the law presumes from the killing, an the eviences of it which were otherwise shown by the circuriistances at the point of time when the killing occurre, but ha the right to a any other evience, as former gruges, former threats, previous lying in wait, cumulative of the former, an • thus effectually to repel any inferences that might be rawn in favor of the efence from the circumstances that transpire at the time of the killing. In like manner, anteceent facts an circumstances, from which any reasonable presumption coul arise, or inference be rawn, that the course of conuct pursue by the prisoner at the time of the killing ha been previously premeitate an resolve upon by him, in reference to a probable effort to bring him back into perfect suborination to the lawful authority of his master, although without any reference to the particular iniviual slain, tene at once, not only to eluciate the intention of the slave at the’time of striking the fatal blow, but the state an conition of his heart, both as to evil esign in general, an in being resolve, in pursuance of the ictates of such wicke, eprave an malignant evil esign in general, to o the particular, unlawful act of resisting the rightful authority of his master at all hazars, incluing that of taking human life in general, regarless of social uty an without respect to persons.
Such a resolye, prompte by the ictates of such a heart, coul not be otherwise, than essentially malicious, an if in being acte out, human life was taken, although uner circumstances which, isconnecte with such resolve, might lay grouns for presumptions that the slayer was actuate by a esign to save his own life, or was prompte by circumstances transpiring at the time strongly calculate to excite the passions of terror an resentment, it coul not be otherwise than a legitimate point of enquiry by the jury, whether or not the homicie ha been really superinuce by the former, although apparently by the latter, to the en that the presumption in favor of manslaughter might be legitimately overslaughe by these cumulative presumptions of malice.
. It is in this point of view that we think the jury in this case ha the right to consier an weigh the evience objecte to. They ivere sitting in jugment upon an act which, in point of law, was to be essentially characterize by the motive of the heart which prompte it. These in the orer of Provience are hien an beyon the reach of human law, until evelope by acts of commission, or of omission, which present them to its jugment in etermining the quality of the act brought in question. Every act then of either class, which in the range of probability coul cast a ray of light upon the motive, which prouce the homicie in question, was legitimately within the range of the investigation, although occurring at an anteceent time, or at another place unless forbien by the rule esigne to confine the investigation to the issue mae; an this rule, as we have seen, oes not exclue any evience that tens to prove or eluciate any of the matters involve in the issue. An regaring the evience objecte to in this case as of that character, we think the court below properly allowe it to go to the jury.
The secon bill of exceptions raises the question, whether or not the confessions of the accuse, being otherwise unexceptionable in point of law, can be allowe to be prouce in evience after the facts themselves have been proven by witnesses who were present when they transpire. We think it perfectly clear that they may, being both of the same grae of evience, although iffering in the weight to be given to them by the jury.
In the thir, it is amitte that it was shown that the confessions were obtaine without the prisoner having been promise or threatene in any way, an that there was no inucement ,or reason hel out to him to- answer the question propoune by one of his guars “what he ha against the ecease to inuce him to strike him,” or otherwise to talk upon the subject. But it is insiste, as the confessions were so mae in response to that question, which it is urge implie the guilty act of the prisoner, an was mae to one of his guar at a time when he was in chains an being brought to jail upon the charge in question, that they ought to have been exclue from the jury. In Mr. Greenleaf’s work on evience the law upon this subject is thus state: “Though it is necessary to the amissibility of a confession that it shoul have been voluntarily mae, that is, that it shoul have been mae, as before shown, without the appliances of hope or fear from persons having authority, yet it is not necessary that it shoul have been the prisoner’s own spontaneous act. It will be receivable though it were inuce by spiritual exhortations, whether of a clergyman or any other person; by solemn promise of secrecy, even confirme by an- oath, or by reason of the prisoner’s having been runk, or by some collateral benefit or boon-, no hope or favor having been hel out in respect to the criminal charge against him, or by any eception practice on the prisoner or false representation mae to him for that purpose, provie there is no reason to suppose that the inucement hel out was calculate to prouce any untrue confession, which is the main point to be consiere. So, a confession is amissible though it is elicite by questions, whether put to a prisoner by a magistrate, officer or private person, an the form of the question is immaterial to the amissibility, even though it assumes the prisoner’s guilt, In all these cases the evience may be lai before the jury, however little it may weigh uner the circumstances, an however reprehensible may be the moe in which, in some of them, it was obtaine.” (1 Greenl. Ev. part 2, ch. 12, sec. 229, p. 293, 5 eition.)
Although in some few of the cases state in this text, we woul look closely to the authorities, upon which they are base, before eclaring the law to the full extent that they are state to go, we can have no hesitancy, on the question before us now, in holing that the objection taken was not goo.
The fourth bill of exceptions presents a question of practice in this wise. The name of Benjamin Watson, the master of the prisoner, was enorse upon the inictment as a witness; he was summone as such for the State, was in attenance upon the trial, an with the other State’s witnesses was sworn in chief, but he was not interrogate or put upon the stan by the State as a witness. The prisoner claime the right to cross-examine him upon the whole case, an relie upon the English practice. The court overrule his motion. Upon an examination of the authorities, we think that the ecie preponerance in the American courts, is in favor of confining the right of cross-examination to those facts an circumstances only, connecte with the matters actually state in the irect examination of a witness; an that if the cross-examining party wishes to examine the witness as to other matters, he must o so by making the witness his own-, an calling him as such in the subsequent progress of the case (1 Greenl. Ev. part 3, ch. 3, sec. 445, p. 562.)
The fifth bill of exceptions presents the question whether the owner of a slave is a competent witness in a prosecution involving the life of the slave. In this case he was offere as a witness on the part of the prisoner; the State objecte because of his pecuniary interest as owner, an the court sustaine the objection. This question first was iscusse in North Carolina, in a case where a master refuse to testify against his slave, an on error his appeal was sustaine, but the court, in the iscussion lai great stress upon the fact of general incompetency,-because of the law of that State, which mae the master substantially a party to the recor, by reason of the provision for a jugment of ¡costs against him upon the conviction of his slave. (State vs. Charity, 2 Dev. Rep. 543). In that case, however, Chief Justice Henerson elivere a separate opinion from the majority of the court, an foreshaowe the principles which have since been recognize an aopte in some of the other slave States. He sai, “ My concurrence in the opinion of the court, in excluing the master on the groun of interest, is so feeble that it almost amounts to a issent. Where pecuniary interest only is at stake, to exclue a witness on the score of interest, however small, is applying a scale of morality to our nature sufficiently humiliating. But when the life or eath of a fellow being is to be the result of the trial, to exclue a witness because he may have a pecuniary interest, either in preserving or taking the life of the accuse, is attributing to us, frail as we know ourselves to be, more epravity than we are willing, I think, to amit. The rule, as lai own by the court, as I unerstan it, exclues the master on the same groun, that of interest, in becoming a witness for his slave; for the rule must be mutual. If he cannot be compelle to give evience against his slave, because of his interest, he cannot, even if he is willing, give evience for him on the same groun. I shoul rather suppose that the interest at stake, being so entirely ifferent from that which is orinarily brought forwar to protect a witness from giving evience, orto exclue him> if willing, that it is not to be weighe in the same balances with mere pecuniary interest. It is so transcenant in its nature that its weight is not to be ascertaine by mere money balances.”
The same question afterwars arose in Tennessee, in a case where, like in this before us, the master’s evience ha been rejecte by the Circuit Court, on the groun of interest. The court reverse the jugment for that error, an in elivering its opinion, by Reese, J., sai: “ But it is sai the Circuit Court erre in rejecting the master of the slave when offere as a witness in his favor, on the groun of his incompetency from pecuniary interest. An of this opinion are the court. A father has an interest, which may be valuable, in the services of his minor son, yet it is not questione that he can be a witness for or against him on a charge affecting his life. A master may have a pecuniary interest in the future labor an services of his apprentice, much exceeing, it may be in a few pursuits, the entire value of his slave: yet perhaps it has never occurre to any one that the master is incompetent to testify on behalf of the apprentice in a matter affecting his life. The relation of master an slave is inee ifferent; but in a case like this, the law, upon high grouns of public policy, pretermits for a moment that relation, takes the slave out of the hans of his master, forgets his claims an rights of property,” — as in the case, the juge might have ae, where the trespass for killing a slave is merge into the felony, an prohibits the recovery of the money value of the slave until the slayer has been first trie uner an inictment for the felony. (3 Porter Ala. Rep. 424)—“treats the slave as a rational an intelligent human being, responsible to moral, social an municipal uties an obligations an gives him the benefit of all the forms of trial which jealousy of power an love of liberty have inuce a freeman to throw aroun himself for his own protection. If thep the master knows any fact tening to save the life of the slave, shall society, who have taken from him the slave for the purpose of trial, say to him, not that you are master, an we will weigh your creit, but you are master an shall not speak at all! On grouns of public policy, of common humanity, of absolute necessity, the master must be hel to be competent as a witness for or against the slave. Society will not allow him to say, I have a pecuniary interest in the event of the trial, my testimony may subject me to a loss, an I will not testify against my slave. On the other han, humanity forbis that society shoul say, you have such an interest an shall not be hear to prove a fact in his favor. In cases where one slave may kill another, the master may often be the only person cognizant of his guilt, or the only person who can establish his innocence. Shall he refuse to speak in the one case, lest he incur a loss? Shall his lips be seale in the other, because he has an interest? Public policy an common humanity eclare the necessity of so treating this relation that the guilty shoul not escape punishment, or the ipnocent be mae to suffer.” (Elijah vs. The State, 1 Humph. R. 102.)
Afterwars, in the year 1841, a case raising the same question was brought before the High Court of Errors an Appeals in Mississippi. That also was a case where the master of the slave was offere as a witness for him in the Circuit Court, an that court refuse to allow him to testify, on the groun of interest; an for this error the Court of Errors reverse the jugment, an Chief Justice Sharkey, after approving the opinion of the court in Tennessee, which we have cite, as “base upon soun an humane principles” an recognizing the analogy to the case of master an apprentice, on the score of interest, then, in treating the question as one of public policy an common humanity, remarks as follows: “The master has the custoy of his slave an owes to him protection, an it woul be a rigorous rule inee if the master coul not be a witness in behalf of his slave 1 What woul be the conition of the slave, if the rule which bins him to perpetual servitue, shoul also create such an interest in the master as to eprive him of the testimony of that master? The harships of such a rule will illy comport with that humanitjr which shoul be extene to that race of people. In prosecutions for offences, negroes are to be treate as other persons: an although the master may have ha an interest in his servant, yet the servant ha such an interest in the testimony of his master as will outweigh mere pecuniary consierations, nor can he be eprive of the benefit of that testimony by the mere circumstance that in a civil point of view he was regare by the law as property.” Isham vs. The State, 6 How. (Miss.) R. 35.)
Recognizing these principles of law, public policy an common humanity, thus so aptly presente, as clearly soun, we aopt them without hesitancy, as the true exposition of the point of law in question, an therefore think it clear that the Circuit Court erre in refusing to allow Watson, the master, to testify when offere as a witness on the part of his slave, Austin, the appellant; holing that the matter of Watson’s pecuniary interest lay to his creibility only an not to his competency as a witness.
The remaining question relates to so much of the charge of the court as was objecte to an save in the sixth bill of exceptions. That was, “That if the jury shoul fin that the efenant was in rebellion to the authority of his master, Payne ha a right to take the efenant an to use such force as was necessary to take him, an that if the efenant then attacke Payne an slew him, he was guilty of murer, an his offence coul not be reuce to manslaughter, even although the striking of the efenant by Payne woul have been evience to show an extenuation of the killing of Payne by the efenant from murer to manslaughter, if the slave ha not been at fault in acting in rebellion to the authority of his master.”
From the face of this recor we cannot say that this charge is too latituinous an unqualifie, because the bills of exception neither purport to save all the evience prouce on the trial of the cause, nor all to which the charge was applicable, so as- to exclue any presumption in favor of the charge, that other evience in support of it might have been prouce. But without any regar to this consieration, we are free to say, that the tranquility of the public at large, the security of the master, the value of the slave as property, an the just protection an comfort of the slave himself, all epen so essentially upon his entire suborination to the lawful authority of his master, that we woul hesitate long before we woul eclare otherwise than that the principle, lai own in this charge, was any other than a soun general principle of the common law of slavery, as it exists in our slave States. In preserving this lawful suborination, upon which the best interests of the community, of the master, an of the slave, so raically epen, every citizen in common with the master, has an abiing interest. An when a slave is in rebellion to the lawful authority of his master, whatever force may be necessary to bring him within the pale of suborination, grauate upon principles of law an humanity, let it tcome from what quarter it may, invaes no right of the slave, an consequently oes him no such wrong as the law can recognize as a mitigation or excuse for crime. (Jacob vs. The State, 3 Humph. R. 493.)

This was an action of ebt upon a jugment. The plaintiff sue for the use of Freerick H. Cossitt, James M. Howar an Jno. H. Hill, partners, &c., uner the firm of “ Cossitt, Howar & Hill,” thé amount of ebt emane being $112 85. The writ of summons, which issue upon the filing of the eclaration, containe corresponing recitals. At the return term, the efenant appeare an emurre to the eclaration. The emurrer being sustaine, the plaintiff obtaine leave to file an amene eclaration, at the succeeing term, to which the cause was continue. By his amene eclaration, the plaintiff professe to sue for the use of the same persons composing the firm of “Cossitt, Howar & Hill,” except that the name of the latter was state as Ira H. Hill, an the aggregate ebt emane was $113 ■60. For these suppose variances between the writ an the amene eclaration, the efenant was allowe to file a plea in abatement of the writ. The plaintiff excepte to a ecision of the court overruling his motion-to strike out the plea, an he resting upon this exception, the efenant ha jugment.
In any view of the case, the plea ought to have been treate .as frivolous. The efenant being in court upon his emurrer, the writ of summons to bring him there ha fulfille its office. A variance between the writ an cause of action set forth in the eclaration, to which he ha appeare, was no longer available as a efence. Ole vs. Floy & Erwin, 5 Ark. 249. For aught that appears the amenments were proper to be allowe in the iscretion of the court for the furtherance of justice, of clerical misprisions in the first eclaration, an not operating to the surprise or injury of the efenant, who acquiesce in them. The amene eclaration set out the same cause of action as the former one, varying only as to an item of costs ajuge in the original suit. There being a plaintiff on the recor, having the legal title an right to sue, he was uner no obligation to isclose the name of the person for whose use the suit might have been brought. That was a precaution for the benefit of the cestui que trust, or equitable assignee of the claim, whose rights will be protecte by courts of law against any frauulent combination between the nominal plaintiff an the efenant. So, notwithstaning any misescription of the equitable assignee, the efenant might well have pleae an prove a payment to, or release by the real owner of the eman sue for; so that no substantial right of his coul be impaire by any such mistake or omission in the eclaration.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was action of replevin in the etinet. There was but one count, an in this it was allege in the usual form, that the efenant ha receive the plaintiff’s horse, an although often requeste ha not elivere him, but unlawfully etaine him. It was commence against Malay in his lifetime, who having been afterwars kille by Dalson, his aministrator, Phelan, interpose three pleas: first, non etinet', an in the other two, setting up property an the right of possession in ecease, Malay. Upon these pleas issues were joine, an submitte to a jury, who foun for Dalson, an jugment was renere accoringly. A new trial was move on the part of the aministrator, upon the groun of allege exclusion of competent testimony an of misirection of the jury. This motion was refuse an the cause was brought here by appeal upon a bill of exceptions.
From this, it appears that the line of efence relie upon an attempte to be establishe, was that the unqualifie ownership in the horse in question, of the ecease Malay in his lifetime, was in no egree affecte by the allege purchase of Dalson; because that originate in frau, an was consummate by the felonious act of knowingly paying the purchase money in counterfeit gol coin. To this en, the aministrator, after proving by a witness, that in February, 1852, Dalson came to the house of the ecease an offere him ninety ollars in gol for the horse; that he then left the house of the ecease, taking the horse along with him, accompanie by the ecease; that the ecease returne home after a short time, an forthwith hane over to the witness ninety ollars in gol pieces, which the witness then unerstoo from the ecease, that he ha receive from Dalson in payment for the horse, then offere to prove by the same witness the following aitional facts : That the ecease, Malay, ha no other money in his house at that time : that he owe two ebts in the neighborhoo, one of fifty ollars an the other of forty-five ollars ; that about that time he pai these two ebts with five ollar gol pieces : that the persons to whom these two several payments were mae, ascertaine that the gol pieces pai over to them by Malay were counterfeit gol coin, an immeiately returne them to Malay, then in life: that soon'after these facts transpire, Dalson left the country, an took with him the horse in question: that he was pursue an arreste on a charge of passing feloniously, ninety ollars of counterfeit gol coin on the ecease, Malay, was brought back to the county where the allege offence was committe, an there, after an examination by a competent court, was require to enter into a recognizance for his appearance before the Circuit Court of that county to answer that charge: that immeiately afterwars Dalsonkille Malay; an that certain eighteen pieces of counterfeit five ollar gol coin, then reay to be prouce to the jury, were the same that ha been pai over by Malay to the two persons before mentione, to whom he owe the ebts respectively. But the Circuit Court refuse to permit any of these facts to be proven to the jury, because, as is state in the bill of exceptions, “ that there was no proof nor offer on the part of the efenant to prove that the gol pieces allege to be counterfeit, were the same pai by Dalson to the ecease.”
It is true, that in this offer to prouce testimony to the jury there was no offer to prouce irect proof to establish the allege fact that the counterfeit gol coin prouce, were the same that were pai over by Dalson to Malay for the pui’chase money of the horse, but there was certainly an offer to prove a chain of facts an circumstances from which, although a conclusion to this effect woul not necessarily follow, it might have been arrive at by the jury within their just province. Even in criminal cases of the highest grae, that kin of circumstantial evience, classe by the elementary writers as uncertain, is amissible. But in such cases, “because of the more serious an irreparable nature of the consequences of a wrong ecision, the jurors are require to be satisfie beyon any reasonable oubt of the guilt of the accuse, or it is their uty to acquit him; the charge not being prove by that higher egree of evience which the law emans. In civil cases it is sufficient if the evience on the whole agrees with an supports the hypothesis which it is auce to prove; but in criminal cases it must exclue every other hypothesis, but that of the guilt of the party. In both cases a verict may be well foune on circumstances alone; an these often lea to a conclusion far more satisfactory than irect evience can prouce. (1 Greenl. Ev., 3 E. sec. 13, p. 74.
The court below therefore erre in refusing to permit proof of the facts, an circumstances offere to be shown in evience. Of their relevancy there coul be no question, as it is clear that where property has been, obtaine from the owner by a felonious act, his unqualifie ownership is not in the least change, an he may peaceably take it, in whose hans soever he may fin it. (Long on Sales, page 166, 7, 8, an cases there cite.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The plaintiffs in error being sue by the Bank, upon a note which they ha mae payable to her, interpose a plea, setting up certain matters in abatement. The plea, on motion of the plaintiff below, was stricken from the files, to which the efenants excepte, an suffere final jugment.
Inasmuch as the plea, re-instate upon the recor by the bill of exceptions, appears to be applicable to the action, an, for aught that appears, pleae in apt time, goo in form, signe by counsel an verifie by affiavit; in short, having all the formal requisites of a plea, our opinion is, that it ought to have been emurre to, if the plaintiff below woul question its legal sufficiency. This point was expressly rule in Sillivant vs. Rearon, 5 Ark. 140, followe by Wilson vs. Shannon, 1 Eng. 198. In Pope vs. Tunstall, 2 Ark. 209, the question of practice was waive, because the court thought the plea which ha been stricken out in that case, was goo in substance as well as form, an therefore felt at liberty to consier the case in the same light as if the pleaings ha come up on emurrer. But the case last referre to cannot be safely followe as a preceent, because the refusal of the court in any case that might come before it, to consier the legal,sufficiency of a plea, which ha been improperly stricken out on motion, woul be an implie ecision against its legal sufficiency; whereas, accoring to the establishe rules of pleaing, the proper moe of tenering an issue in law is by emurrer; an without breaking own those rules the emurrant cannot evae it by an informal motion, so as to eprive the efenant of all benefit of any question of law upon the legal sufficiency of the plea, unless he shall get it again upon the recor by bill of exceptions.
True, a plea, apparently goo on its face, might well be struck from the files, because frivolous or vexatious ; as for example, where the same matter is attempte to be pleae, which the court has once ajuge insufficient, an the pleaer coul only rest upon the ecision, or plea over. But nothing of the kin is shown here. An so, like many other legal istinctions, where the lines run into one another, it might sometimes be ifficult to etermine whether a party shoul move to strike from the files, or be put to his emurrer. But accoring as one or the other may be proper, the office of a emurrer cannot be subserve by a motion.
At an early ay, Means vs. Cromwell, 1 Ark. 247, this court foun it necessary to check the practice which ha grown up, of interposing by informal motions, not traversable or tenering any issue of fact, matters in abatement, or which properly belonge to that class of efences. An without any particular examination of that or the several subsequent cases to the same purport, there can be no oufitthat the general tenency of them to iscourage such innovations in pleaing was right.

1862611,Ellis vs. Dunham,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins
elivere the opinion of the Court.
Leaving out of view extraneous matters, the material facts, as amitte or proven, on the trial of this cause, appear to be as follows: One Malone mae his writing obligatory for the p&yment of money to Ellis, (the efenant below) ate October 20, 1846, anue six months after ate. On the 12th of June 1847, an after the obligation became ue, Ellis assigne it to one Hough, who, on the 10th of November, 1848, assigne it to Dunham (the plaintiff below). Hough an Dunham, respectively emane payment of Malone,' who i not pay, but when such emans were mae, oes not appear; nor oes it appear that any notice of the emans upon Malone, an his refusal to pay, was given to Ellis, until the ay before the suit was commence, when he was notifie in writing, by Dunham, of such eman an refusal, an that he woul be hel liable upon his assignment. The suit was commence on the 26th ay of April, 1849. The parties live in ajoining counties, the efenant about fifty miles, an Malone about fifteen miles from the plaintiff below. We take the fact, about which there was conflicting testimony, to be foun by the verict, that at the time of the assignment by the efenant to Hough, Malone the obligor was insolvent.
Among the various instructions aske for by both parties, the court, on the motion of the plaintiff, an against the objection of the efenant, charge the jury, to the effect, that if they believe from the evience that Malone, the maker of the bon, was insolvent at the time the assignment of it was mae by Ellis to Hough, the assignment was an original guaranty of the payment of the bon, an the efenant’s liability was fixe instantly, an the assignee was not boun to make eman of payment from Malone an give notice of non-payment, because he woul not be require to o a useless act. Also, that if Ellis assigne the bon after ue, such an enorsement was an original unertaking on his part, that the bon shoul be pai, an that no eman of payment of Malone, or notice of his refusal to pay, was necessary to fix the liability of Ellis."" Also, that the bon being assigne after ue, if they believe that both Hough an the plaintiff emane payment of Malone, an he refuse payment, an that the plaintiff gave the efenant notice of the eman upon the maker, an his refusal, at any time before the commencement of the suit, it was sufficient to fix the efenant’s liability. On the other han the court, at the request of the efenant, refuse to instruct the jury, to the effect that the efenant coul not be mae liable on his assignment, unless the plaintiff ha given him reasonable, or ue notice of non-payment by the obligor : also, that if the jury believe from the evience that the holer use no exertions to collect the note for several years, he thereby ischarge the enorser.
These instructions woul seem to have been given an refuse uner an entire misapprehension of the law. If the plaintiff sought to recover uner what may be calle the ol law of assignments — see Morse vs. Johnson, ecie at January term, 1853, he coul only o so against his immeiate assignor, upon the contract of assignment, by showing that he ha use ue iligence in suing the obligor or party primaiily liable, an in prosecuting him to insolvency, not repute but legal insolvency, evience by ischarge uner the insolvent acts from arrest upon ca. sa., or a return of nulla bona.
But the assignee in this case, in orer to recover against a remote assignor, between whom an himself, there was no privity of contract, must have availe himself of so much of the statute of assignments of 1837, Digest, Title, Assignments, sec. 9, as is introuctory of the law merchant an of its analogous rules.
The bon here being assigne after ue, the nature of the contract is that the enorsement is equivalent to the rawing of a new bill by the enorser upon the maker or obligor, who stans as acceptor of it, in favor of the enorsee, an payable on eman. An in orer to charge the enorser in such case, his contract being conitional upon receiving ue notice of non-payment, as at the law merchant, the assignee or enorsee (for uner this statute they seem to be convertible terms) must use reasonable iligence in presenting the bon or note, to the maker for payment. The time an manner of giving the notice woul be governe by the rules of the law merchant in similar cases. What woul be reasonable iligence in making the eman of payment, might often be a mixe question of law an fact for the jury to etermine, uner the instructions of the court, an accoring. as they may fin the facts proven. But, as hel in Jones vs. Robinson, 6 Eng. 511, the elay of presentment for so great a lapse of time in this case, not explaine or accounte for, amounte to gross negligence, an there being no question about this, as a matter of fact, the court below shoul have charge the jury what the legal conclusion was, viz : that the plaintiff ha faile to use ue iligence. No matter when the eman of payment was mae, it was nugatory an unavailing to charge the assign- or without notice to him of the non-payment, an the case here stans as if there ha been no presentment or eman of payment, until the ay before the suit was brought, nearly two years-after the assignment by the efenant to Hough.
Uner the statute, where the bon, bill or note, is transferre' before ue, the holer, by using ue iligence, may hol liable all or any of the prior parties. But where the transfer is after ue, we apprehen that it is each separate enorsement or assignment, that is equivalent to the rawing of a new bill, unless inee,, all the transfers are mae within the perio of iligence, which the law woul require at the hans of the first assignee; in. other wors, an over ue bon or note, cannot be transferre by various successive enorsements, at istant intervals of time, so as to subject all prior parties in one common liability to the last enorsee, as woul be the case when negotiable paper, payable at a fixe time, is enorse before ue. Supposing it to be law, that if Hough, the first assignee, by a seasonable eman upon the maker for payment, an notice of non-payment to the efenant, his immeiate assignor, ha thus fixe his liability upon the contract of assignment, any subsequent assignment of the bon or note by Hough, woul transfer that liability along with it as a chose in action to a remote assignee, yet it oes not follow that the first assignee of a note, past ue, having faile to fix the liability of his assignor by ue presentment an notice of non-payment, can by an assignment of his own, confer any authority upon a secon assignee, to revive or renew the conitional liability of the first assignor, which, by such neglect ha become ischarge. Uner these circumstances, the plaintifi below, by a prompt eman of payment of the original maker, an notice of non-payment to Hough, his immeiate assignor, might have hel him equally liable with the maker or obligor, an this, we think, woul be giving to the statute quite as liberal an beneficial construction as it is susceptible of: but without changing the whole character of the contract, the eman an notice to Hough woul not make the efenant liable, unless ue notice of eman an refusal ha been given to him. What is ue notice in such case woul be ascertaine by regaring him as the rawer of a sight raft upon the maker, an so any question of reasonable iligence on the part of the payee, or any holer of such raft, woul be etermine as at the law merchant!
It oes not seem necessary to notice any other errors, that might be consiere as appearing on this recor. The jugment will be reverse an the cause remane for trial anew.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of assumpsit, brought by Patrick against Holleville, an in which there was a trial by jury on the general issue, an a verict an jugment for Patrick, to review which this writ of error has been sue out by Holleville.
The eclaration contains two counts, similar to each other, but on two ifferent causes of action; an it may be remarke, that a eclaration coul harly be more inartificially rawn, an if we felt ispose to countenance technical objections, there woul be no ifficulty in fining them in it. The case stans in this court on the eclaration alone; because the bons an assignments therein escribe have not been mae a part of the recor by oyer, bill of exceptions or otherwise, an cannot be notice for any purpose whatever, although copie into the transcript.
The eclaration avers the writings obligatory to have been mae by William Strong an payable to Holleville on the 1st January, 1841; that they were before payment, assigne by him to Patrick, “to wit, on the 10th ay of July, 1841:” that when they became ue, they were presente fpr payment, an payment require “accoring to the tenor an effect thereof;” but that neither Strong nor Holleville pai the same; an it is then averre that “of all which sai premises the sai Holleville afterwars, to wit: on the 10th ay of July, 1841, ha notice.”
As a general rule, it is not to be enie, that a party is always boun by his own pleaings, an can make no proof in contravention of them. But it is equally as well establishe, as an exception, that it is not essential to state the real or precise time unless it constitutes a material part of the contract; nor in criminal proceeings, except where time forms an ingreient of the offence. An although a certain ay is state, yet neither in civil nor criminal cases, nee the ay be prove as lai, but an entirely ifferent ay may be prove, an it will be well enough. 1 Chitty's Pl. 288, 289. 1 Chitty's Cr. L. 224.
In assumpsit on a contract, whether express or implie, the plaintiff is at liberty to prove that it was mae at any other time than that allege. 2 Stra. 806. So, in an action against the acceptor of a bill payable after sight, an allegation that it was accepte on the ay of the ate will be prove, though it appear it was accepte on a subsequent ay. 1 Chitty's Pl. 288.
It was neither necessary nor usual to aver in the eclaration the precise time when the assignments were mae, or when payment was require, or notice of non-payment given. These were all matters of evience, which, for the sake of preserving brevity an perspicuity in pleaing, are never to be state. 1 Chitty's Pl. 258. Those ates were state uner a vielicet, an we are of opinion, might have been rejecte as surplusage, an which will not vitiate after verict. Chapman vs. Smith 13 John. 80. Hyslop vs. Jones, 3 McLean, 96. The case of Jackson vs. Henerson, 3 Leigh, 210, 217, is an express authority to the point, that if the eclaration avers that a bill was presente, an payment emane when the same became ue an payable, an then uner a scilicet, states a precise ay on which it was one, that ay is immaterial, nee not be prove, an may be rejecte as surplusage. To the same effect is the case of Bynner vs. Russell, 1 Bingham 23. S. C. 7 Moore 266, on the authority of which the case in Virginia was ecie.
It cannot amit of serious oubt, that it was competent for either party on the trial, to have prove that the assignments ha been mae, or that payment ha been emane, or notice of non-payment given at ifferent perios from those averre in the eclaration. Neitherparty was boun by those piecise ates, an might, as we have seen, have treate them as surplusage, an for aught we can know, such proof might have been actually-mae as above inicate.
This case was trie by a jury on the general issue. No exceptions were taken uring the trial, nor was any motion mae for a new trial, or in arrest of jugment. It stans on error, an consequently if the eclaration iscloses a cause of action the jugment must be affirme. The octrine on this subject is that when a eclaration or other pleaing sets forth a goo title or groun of action in a efective manner, the imperfection will be cure by verict, but a want of title is not aie. 1 Saun. 227, 2 Soun. 319, a, b. c. 10 Bac.

An this court in Sevier vs. Holliay, 2 Ark. 571, approve an lai own the same principle, namely, that “where there is any efect, imperfection or omission in any pleaing, whether in substance or in form, which woul have been a fatal objection on emurrer, yet if the issue joine be such as necessarily requires on the trial, proof of the faots so efectively or imperfectly state, or omitte, an without which it is not to be presume that either the juge woul irect the jury to give, or the jury woul have given the verict, such efect, imperfection or omission is cure by the verict at common law.” Now no one can rea the eclaration without perceiving that it iscloses a right or cause of action, although partially obscure by the want of technical skill an precision in the pleaer. The imperfections in it are precisely of that character which a verict was intene, uner the rule above lai own, to cure. An it is the more essential that it shoul be so, because, inepenent of the general presumption of correctness which attaches to jugments of inferior courts until the contrary is mae to appear, we may well suppose that on the trial, such facts were prove as establishe the liability of the plaintiff in error, holing it clear that this might have been one uner the eclaration, an on the issue that was forme.
The case of Ruston vs. Aspinall, Dougl. 653, relie on by th© counsel for the plaintiff in error, is not applicable, because, the eclaration faile to allege a eman an refusal by the acceptor; but in this eclaration, eman, refusal an notice are allege. Consiering that the eclaration in this case iscloses a cause of action, an that the imperfections in it'are cure by the verict, an we affirm the jugment.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
At the October term, 1852, of the county court of Pulaski county, certain proceeings, to which Couch was a party, touching a public roa, were finally ecie aversely to him. He took a bill of exceptions, file an affiavit, an praye an appeal to the Circuit Court, which the County Court grante. On the 6th of December following, a certifie transcript of the proceeings was file in the Circuit Court, an on the 20th of January, 185#; on motion of the attorney general, Couch being present an resisting, the Circuit Court ismisse the suppose cause, to which Couch, by his attorney, excepte, an sue out a writ of error to this court.
There was really no cause in the Circuit Court to ismiss. The prayer for an appeal,, an the action of the County Court upon it ha no legal effect to transfer the cause to the Circuit Court: nor i the filing of the transcript there, on the part of Couch, have any such effect. Not that the Circuit Court ha no appellate jurisiction of such a cause, but because no steps ha been taken to invoke that jurisiction. Such steps can be taken in the Circuit Court only in the absence of statutory regulations, touching such cases, of which we have none, beyon the act of the 21st December, 1846, (Dig. p. 313, sec. 12), investing the Circuit Court with intermeiate appellate power, but making no regulations for its exercise.
Until the Legislature shall think proper to make such regulations, the Circuit Courts, at the instance of parties, must use their common law an other means known to the law, to give effect to these intermeiate appellate powers thus investe in them as (Carnall vs. Crawfor county, 6 Eng. R. at p. 613), to matters properly cognizable in the County Courts, an not provie for by the act of the 4th January, 1849, (Pamph. Act p. 59). The case of Carnall vs. Crawfor county, was within the provisions of this latter act an was brought into the Circuit Court in accorance with its regulations, an it was hel that in such ca.ses the Legislature contemplate a qualifie trial e novo in the Circuit Court, as provie for appeals from the Probate Court. Cases like this at bar, however, being unprovie for by statute, remain, as at common law, an are subject to be quashe or affirme only in the Circuit Court, as the case may be. The process in the Circuit Court performing the functions of a writ of error, (ib. at p. 614).
Neither the constitution nor any statute of this State invests the county court with exclusive j urisiction in matters of public roas, close to superior review; on the contrary these courts are oubly open to the primary review of the Circuit Courts clothe, as they are, with constitutional power of superintening an statutory power of intermeiate appeal. Doubtless, therefore, when the party in this case shall properly present his case in the Circuit Court, he will be entitle to have it hear an have the oings in the County Court either quashe or affirme.
Fining no error in the action of the Circuit Court, its oings in this case must be affirme.

Cloyes,'' an his wife, ha conveye to another of sai plaintiffs, the sai Absalom Fowler an his heirs an assigns forever, previous to the commencement of this suit, one-fourth part of the entire right, title, interest an claim of the sai Nathan H., an his wife, in an to the north-west fractional quarter of section number two, of township number one north of range number twelve west, containing about thirty 88-100 acres, it being state in sai ee upon its face, that sai lan was hel by a pre-emption right; an at the same time of offering sai ee as evience, the plaintiffs state to the court that they were prepare to prove an woul prove, in connection therewith, that the lans an lots in controversy are on an embrace within sai fractional quarter section of lan, that the efenants were in possession of the same at an before the commencement of this suit: that the same are situate in the county of Pulaski; that uner the act of Congress of the 29th of May, A. D. 1830, granting pre-emption i-ights to settlers upon the public lans, the Register an Receiver of the proper lan office in Arkansas, upon evience prouce to their satisfaction, grante a pre-emption to the sai Nathan Cloyes, the eler, now ecease, in his lifetime, to the aforesai fractional quarter section of lan, on the 28th ay of May, A.

Pope, in selecting one thousan acres ajoining Little Rock, grante by Congress to raise a fun for builing a court house an jail for the territory of Arkansas, an that such enorsement was mae by the irection of the commissioner of the General Lan Office. An .the sai plaintiffs, at the same time, offere to prove that such location so mae by Governor Pope, was mae after the sai grant of the pre-emption, an was null an voi. An they offere no other evience, an state they ha no other to show .title in the sai plaintiff, Fowler. But the efenants objecte .to the sai ee being rea in evience, upon the single groun that such conveyance to the sai plaintiff, Absalom Fowler, gave him no title by which he coul, jointly with his co-plaintiffs or otherwise, maintain an action of ejectment; an this objeclion having been sustaine by the Circuit Court an sai ee rejecte an exclue upon that groun, the plaintiffs took their bill of exceptions, from which the foregoing facts appear. An final jugment having been renere against them, they brought their case here by writ of error.
The question presente to us is, whether or not this specific objection, no other having been mae to the testimony offere, was well taken.
Our statute authorizes the action of ejectment in all cases, where the plaintiff is legally entitle to the possession of the premises (Dig. ch. 60, p. 454; sec. 1), an in all cases where he “claims the possession uner or by virtue offirst, an entry mae with the Register an Receiver of the proper lan office of the Unite States; secon, a pre-emption right uner the laws of the Unite States; thir, where an improvement has been mae by him on any of the public lans of the Unite States, whether the lans have been surveye or not, an where any person, other than those to whom the right of action is given by the preceing clauses of this section, is in possession of such improvement” (i. sec. 2): an on the trial it will be sufficient for him to “show that, at the time of the commencement of the action, the efenant was in possession of the premises claime, an that the plaintiff ha title thereto, or ha the right to the possession thereof as is eclare by this act to be sufficient to maintain the action of ejectment.” (i. sec., 11.)
We think it clear, from the phraseology of this statute, when consiere in connection with its remeial nature an obvious general esign, that it was not the purpose of the Legislature to confine its benefits to the purchaser in the first instance an to the pre-emptor in the secon, but equally to exten them to all persons, who might lawfully succee to their rights. The language use is certainly sufficiently comprehensive for this; an the lawful successors to such rights are as clearly within the mischief as the original purchaser or pre-emptor. Inee, ’not only woul such a narrow construction of the statute be against its obvious spirit, an contract the generality of the expressions use, but it woul be to lose sight of so much of the every ay transactions of common life in this State as relate to the tranfer from han to han of these imperfect titles of lan, an to suppose they were unknown to the Legislature. In accorance with this view of the statute, this court hel in the case of McLarren vs. Wicker an others, (3 Eng. R. p. 122), that a patent certificate issue to the father was sufficient to enable his heir to maintain the action of ejectment. It is true that, in that case, the court reste the transfer of the title to the heir, not upon escent, but upon the act of Congress, which eclares that when a patent issue to one who is ea, in pursuance of a certificate of purchase issue in his lifetime, the title shall enure to his heirs. The result, however, is the same, whatever may work the transfer, because the action in that case was sustaine, not upon the patent but upon the certificate, although brought by the heirs.
There can be no goo reason why, if the successor to the original purchaser or to the pre-emptor, can maintain the action when he succees to the rights of the purchaser or pre-emptor, by irect operation of law, that he shoul not o so if he succees to those rights by lawful acts of the parties. In both cases he succees by operation of law; in the one case, irectly; an in the other, inirectly by its operation.
It is true that, at common law, if a man ha in him only the right of possession or property, he coul not convey it to another,' lest, in the language of the ancient law, “pretene titles might be grante to great men, whereby justice might be troen own an the weak oppresse.” But this was for the feual reason that possession was an inispensable element of alienation, of which the law was so tenacious, even after the statute of uses, that a pretence title itself, woul not prevent the seizin of the lan from passing from the bargainor to the bargainee by virtue of that statute, where he was actually seize, although his title was but pretene. At the same time reversions an veste remainers might be grante, because it was consiere that the possession of the particular tenant was the possession of him in reversion or in remainer, an was not averse. An upon the same principle the better an more recent authorities show that an equitable interest was always assignable; because after the sale, out of which an equitable interest grew, the venor an those uner him, woul hol as trustees for the venee an those uner him, an therefore there coul be no such averse possession as to make the title pretene. But every vestige of this feual octrine, which thus restraine the alienation of real estate, has been swept off by our statute, which enacts that, “ Any person claiming title to any real estate may, notwithstaning there may be an averse possession thereof, sell an convey his interest in the same manner an with like effect as if he was in the actual possession thereof.” (Dig. ch. 37, p. 265, sec. 6). The next section {i. 7), eclares that “ The term real estate, as use in this act, shall be construe as co-extensive in meaning with ‘lans tenements an hereitaments’ an as embracing chattels real.” An Sir Ewar Coke says, that of these three, “hereitaments” is by far the largest an most comprehensive expression, because it inclue not only lans an tenements, but whatever may be inherite, be it corporeal or incorporeal, real, personal or mixe. An thus it appears that, although at common law, there were certain rights to an interests in real estate, that for want of possession, either actual or constructive, coul not be alienate to a stranger, although they coul be release or evise by will, or woul pass to the heir or executor — as contingencies an mere possibilities — such is the comprehensiveness of our statute in embracing hereitaments in the term “real estate,” that that istinction is also annihilate, an therefore, in this State, whatever interest in real estate may be inherite, may be bargaine, sol an conveye,. An it is expressly eclare by our statute of Descents, that the “real estate” in that statute contemplate, is every “estate, interest an right, legal an equitable, in lans, tenements an hereitaments, except such as are eterminable, or are extinguishe by the eath of the intestater seize or possesse thereof, in any manner other than by lease for years an estate for the life of another person.” (Dig.ch. 56, secs. 18, 19).
The result is, that as at the common law, all persons in possession were, prima facie, capable both of conveying an purchasing, unless the law ha lai them uner some particular isability personally, or as to the subject matter, so uner the operation of our statutory regulations all persons having an inherita-' ble right, interest or title, in or to any real estate, are pl'ahe in the same conition as to alienation or purchase. An there being no pretence of personal isability as to these parties,* an none as to the subject matter in consequence of the operation of our statute in enlarging the right of alienation an purchase almost to an unlimite extent in this respect, we cannot oubt but that, uner the ee of conveyance offere in eyience, if regularly execute an vali in other respects, Fowler succeee lawfully to so much of the right, interest an estate of Nathan-H. Cloyes, as the ee purporte to convey, as fully as it came-to the latter from his ecease father by irect operation of law.. We therefore think it clear that Fowler was a proper party plaintiff, equally entitle with the heirs to maintain ejectment uner-our statute, an that the objection in question was not well taken,, an ought to have been overrule by the court below.
For this error the jugment must be reverse an the cause remane to be proceee with.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This is an action upon a collector’s bon, brought against the sheriff an ex-officio assessor an collector of taxes of Pope county, an his securities. After setting out the bon an conition the breach assigne is, “that the sai John W. Jones i not well an truly collect an pay over the sai sum of thirteen hunre an seventeen ollars an seventy-seven cents so orere to be levie for the purposes of revenue of the sai county of Pope,” whereby the sai writing became an is forfeite, &c.
The enorsement on the writ woul show a regular service on the efenants, but it oes not appear to be signe by the sheriff. For this apparent iminution a writ of certiorari woul be aware ex-officio, if necessary in orer to affirm. The entry of the jugment is quite inartificial, leaving it oubtful whether the efenants appeare, so far as-to waive the necessity of a jury to enquire into the truth'of the breaches, an assess the amages, an consent that they shoul be assesse by the court sitting as a jury, though that seems to be the purport of the entry. An so, presuming everything possible in favor of the court below, it might be gathere from the whole entry, that the court below ascertaining the efalcation of the collector to be $113 08, an the penalty accrue upon it, tobe $226, intene to give jugment for the penalty of the bon, an that execution be aware for the amount of the amages assesse, together with the accruing forfeiture of five per cent, per month upon the amount of the original efalcation from the renition of the j ugment until the same shoul be pai an satisfie with costs, &c.
But waiving the consieration of those matters assigne for error, the jugment will have to be reverse upon the thir assignment which questions the sufficiency of the eclaration. Upon the principle ajuge by this court in the case of Outlaw vs. The Governor, 5 Ark., 468, relating to the moe of ascertaining an fixing the liability of the principal an securities upon an aministration bon, it was necessary for the eclaration in this case to contain an averment, either that the collector ha settle with the county court an faile to pay over the amount ue, Dig. Title, Revenue or Counties, secs. 6 an 7, or that he faile to settle, an that the county court proceee to ajust his accounts, an finally proceee to rener jugment against him, for the amount ue, with the penalty ae thereto, an fifty per centum per annum thereon, ib. sec. 34, et seq. Carnall vs. Crawfor county, 6 Eng. 624. Trice vs. Crittenen co., 2 Eng. 159.
The county court is the forum where the liability of the collector, upon which that of his securities epens, is to be ascertaine an evience by its recors. An ajuication in that forum is conclusive evience against the securities, as well as the collector, in an action upon his bon in the Circuit Court. There can be no liability upon the collector’s bon without such ajucation unless the Circuit Court can, in an action upon the bon raw to itself, in a collateral way, a jurisiction to investigate an settle the accounts of elinquent officers for the collection of revenue, which appropriately belongs to the county courts.
The jugment will be reverse, an the cause remane to the court below, with leave to be further proceee in, if the plaintiff' shall file an amene eclaration within such time as may be allowe by rule of that court, the efenants being consiere as having ue notice of the penency of the suit.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of covenant, brought by Williams against Green, upon an article of agreement entere into between them on the 6th of October, 1852, for the sale of a tract of lan an improvements: the substance of the agreement, so far as necessary to be here state, being, that Williams trae an bargaine to Green a certain tract of lan, containing forty-five acres more or less, the price to be thirty ollars per acre for the lan, with the aition of the value of the improvements upon it, such valuation to be mae by two persons name in the article, an for which payment was to be mae in goos of Green, then in store, consisting of groceries, harware; &c., at the original cost, with the aition of freight on certain of the articles, an the balance of the payment for the lan to be mae in goo mules at cash valuation. The. agreement conclues as follows : “In wtness of the above trae we hereby set our hans an seals, an on forfeiture of complying with it on the part of either Green or Williams, we hereby bin ourselves, our heirs, &c., in the sum of five hunre ollars, to be well an truly pai. In testimony whereof, &c.
The eclaration, after setting out the execution of the agreement, procees to aver that Waters an Grayson, the persons name therein, value the improvements referre to, at a certain sum of money, of which the efenant ha notice, an that, on the 20th ay of the same month, Williams an wife mae an acknowlege their ee of conveyance in fee, of the lan an improvements to Green, expresse to be for the gross consieration of $1,636, with covenant of general warranty an relinquishment of ower, an tenere the same to Green, who refuse to-accept it, or to comply in any respect with the agreement on his part. Therefore, accoring to what seems to be the intention of the pleaer, though somewhat inartificially expresse, the plaintiff cl aims to recover the specifie sum of five hunre ollars agree to be pai by either party, on forfeiture of complying with the trae.
The case went off in the court below upon emurrer sustaine to the eclaration. One of the causes assigne for insufficiency, an again insiste upon here is, that the eclaration avers a tener of the ee by the plaintiff to the plaintiff. Supposing this allegation to be in any way material, the whole tenor an the immeiate context of the eclaration show it to have been a mere clerical misprision, the amenment of which, if any amenment was neee, coul occasion no surprise to the efenant; an the objection is only notice because it has been urge by counsel.
But uner the clause of general emurrer, an treating the action as being brought to recover the sum of five hunre ollars as stipulate amages, the question arises upon the construction of the instrument sue on, whether it was the intention of the parties to liquiate the amages consequent upon the failure of either party to comply with the agreement, or whether the clause quote was esigne as a mere penalty.
If there is any branch of the law, sometimes inveighe against for uncertainty, eserving of such a reproach, it is the subject we have here to consier. An though amonishe by the caution evince by other courts of the anger of attempting to lay own any general rule for cases of this escription, it seems to be necessary, in orer to explain the grouns of our ecision, to notice, albeit in a cursory an unsatisfactory manner, the principles which may affect the question to be ecie.
Anciently, at the common law, the penalty name in a bon was a security for the performance of the conition annexe to it. Upon forfeiture of the conition the obligee was entitle to recover the penalty, which was at the same time the utmost limit an beyon which the obligor’s liability coul not be extene. To obviate the harship an injustice often growing out of this stubborn rule, arose one of the early jurisictions of courts of equity, to relieve against penalties an forfeitures, by ecreeing that the jugment for the penal sum shoul stan as a security for the payment by the obligor of such amages as the obligee ha actually sustaine, of which an account woul be taken. The practical effect of .the English statute, re-enacte or tacitly aopte in this country, requiring the plaintiff suing upon a penal bon to suggest the breaches complaine of, an entering a formal jugment for the penalty, to have execution only for the amount of amages assesse, the penalty being in the meantime consiere as a security for any further breaches that might occur, was to enable courts of law to aminister the same relief before affore in chancery. There was no substantial ifference between this form of the remey an an action of covenant upon the conition an for some breach of it, isregaring the penalty; an it became reasonably apparent, that if the courts, for the protection of the obligor, looke to the actual amages sustaine by the obligee, they shoul equally isregar the penalty in favor of the obligee, where his amages for a breach of the conition expressing the real contract of the parties, happene to excee the penalty. While the law was unergoing this change in Englan, some curious illustrations may be foun in the reporte cases, of a halting between the ol an the new opinion. Sometimes the obligor was allowe to relieve himself from all further liability for amages, by paying into court the amount of the penalty; though an unsubstantial compliance with the contract, as unreal as it woul be to compel the obligee in all cases to accept such amages as might be aware to him, without the right in any case to have a specific performance. Wherever we amit that the enquiry now at law, as in equity, is, what amages the obligee has really sustaine by a breach of the conition, it woul seem to follow that, as the obligor cannot, in any case, become liable for the penalty isregaring the conition, so he can claim no protection from it. An it woul seem to be equally plain, that upon bons with a conition, an action of covenant may be maintaine for amages for a breach of the conition, whenever it contains an express or implie unertaking to o or not to o the particular act. The plaintiff in such case will recover amages commensurate with the injury he has sustaine. True, when the obligee brings ebt for the penalty, assigning breaches for the conition, he may not, owing to the technical form of the remey, be enable to recover amages to an amount exceeing the penalty; an upon official bons, an so far as the rights of securities are to be affecte, recoveries against them might not be enforce to an amount exceeing the penalty which is for their protection.
But while courts of equity affor relief against penalties, they will not relieve against liquiate amages. As penalties became unavailing, because the obligee, not entitle to or not seeking a specific performance, was require to accept a compensation in amages for such injury as he coul show he ha sustaine, a new reform of contract was resorte to, whereby the parties anticipate an agree in avance, for a certain amount of amages which woul be accepte as a full compensation for such injury as might be sustaine by a breach of the contract. Many cases may be suppose where it woul be altogether proper an expeient to allow the amages to be thus stipulate. Pruent men unerstaning their own affairs, might not be willing to run the risk of a failure of evience to prove their situation an inucements for entering into the contract, or trace the various sources from whence injury or inconvenience was expecte to result. The obligor an obligee, though for opposite reasons, might be equally unwilling to submit the question of uncertain amages to any arbitration or the precarious assessment of a jury. No court has been bol enough to eny to parties capable of contracting the right to make such contracts as they choose to enter into, in any moe authorize by law, provie they be not illegal, immoral, or against public policy.
But contracts for stipulate amages are narrowly watche, because of the facility they may affor of being use as a cover for penalties in isguise. One of the inflexible rules of law on this subject is, that whenever the sum agree to be pai, though expresse as stipulate amages, is in lieu of the non-payment of a lesser sum, certain or capable of being ascertaine from the terms of the contract, it is construe to be a penalty. Besies violating the usury laws, such a contract coul not be enforce, as stipulate amages, because it woul become a mere subterfuge an evasion of the equitable octrine of relieving against bons with a penalty, conitione for the payment of money. Germain to this is the rule, equally inflexible, that the mortgagor will not be allowe by any shift or evice; to cut himself off from the equity of reemption. Though the creitor, where a high stanar of commercial integrity prevails, may be ruine by his ebtor’s want of punctuality, the law has fixe a certain rate of interest as a compensation for the use of money. This principle istinctly state in Orr vs. Churchil, 1 Hen. Black., pervaes all the cases.
On the other han, where the amages are in their nature uncertain an ifficult of ascertainment, the amount to be pai may be stipulate by the terms of the contract; as for breach of agreement to marry a particular person. Lowe vs. Peers, 4 Burr. 2225. So of agreement not to cany on a rival trae or business, within certain limits, where the breach may consist in acts of frequent recurrence, an the amages are in some egree Conjectural. Crisee vs. Bolton, 3 Car. & Payne, 240, where Best, C. J. refuse to subscribe to the octrine attribute to L. Tentenen, in Ranall vs. Everett, 2 ib. 577, an avocate strongly the right of parties to stipulate for their amages. See also Green vs. Price, 13 Mes. & Welsby 695, S. C. 16 ib. 346. Pierce vs. Fuller, 8 Mass. 223. Nobles vs. Bates, 7 Cowen, 307. Smith vs. Smith, 4 Wen. 468. Dakin vs. Williams, 17 ib. 448. S. C. 22 ib. 201. So for emurrage or elay while work shall remain unfinishe, which is agree to be one by a certain time. Fletcher vs. Dycke, 2 T. R. 10, followe in this country by Curtis vs. Brewer, 17 Pick. 573. An a lanlor may stipulate for a particular course of husbanry, accoring to his suppose interest or caprice, an that if the tenant use the lan ifferently he shall pay an increase rate of rent. Rolfe vs. Peterson, 6 Brown's P. C. 470. So if he fail to resie on the estate. Ponsonby vs. Aams, ib. 417.
At the same time, the aversion of the law to the enforcement of penalties, has inuce the courts to lean in favor of the construction that the sum reserve shoul be hel to be a penalty in cases where, upon the whole contract, there was a oubt whether the parties intene it tobe pai as stipulate amages. We have seen that the insertion of a penalty has become of little or no practical utility, an in this State where specialty ebts have no preference over other ebts ue by simple contract, it coul harly be maintaine that a penalty ailors any security whatever: so that the reason fails, for the criterion sometimes lai own, that where the sum agree to be pai is to secure the performance of some collateral act, it will be construe as a penalty. Yet while the form of bons with a penalty continues to be kept up in public legislation, an men in their private ealings ahere to ancient forms, the mutual observance by the parties of such formality materially influences the construction to be given to the contract. There arc many cases, where on the question of intention the construction turne, to a greater or less egree, upon the aherence to the form of a penal bon with a conition, or the use of the wor penalty, or penal sum.

Stearnes vs. Barrett, 1 Pick. 443. Brown vs. Bellows, 4 ib. 178. Robeson vs. Whitesies, 16 Serg. & Rawle 320. Abrams vs. Counts, 4 Ham. 214. So Buller, J., sai in Fletcher vs. Dyche, that where there is a penalty in a bon, it woul be strange for the sum mentione .in the conition to be calle a penalty. While the case of Sloman vs. Walter, 1 Brown Chy. Cases, asserts the unoubte jurisiction of courts of equity, to relieve against penalties, it might be questione if that, occurring at this ay, woul not be consiere a proper case for liquiate amages, an woul have to be uphel as a penalty upon the groun state by L. Elon, in Astley vs. Welon, (infra,) that there, by the form of the instrument, the sum appeare to be a penalty. But the inications given by the form of the contract, or the expressions use, of an intention to stipulate the amages, or to reserve a penalty merely, are not conclusive, an may be controlle by a contrary intention manifestly appearing from the tenor of the instrument, an the object the parties must have ha in view.
It woul seem to be clear that the acceptance of stipulate amages, which have been agree upon as an aequate compensation for the breach of a covenant to o or not to o any particular act, is an extinguishment of all claim to aitional amages, or for further breaches, an is an implie license to the efenant to o or not to o the act, because, if the obligee ha any right in such case, to have a specific performance, he has waive it by electing to procee for the amages. In some of the cases it appears to be taken for grante, that in orer to constitute liquiate amages, the covenantor must have the option of complying with the contract, or paying the alternative compensation agree upon. White vs Dingly, 4 Mass. 433. Glosson vs. Beale, 7 John. 72. Hasbrook vs. Tappan, 15 i. 200. Gray vs. Crosby, 18 ib. 219. Pearson vs. Williams, 24 Wen. 244. S. C. 26 ib. 630. The covenantee has the right to insist upon entire performance, or the stipulate amages in lieu of it; but where there is a part performance, or acceptance of a benefit uner the contract, the agreement for stipulate amages is broken up. As a compensation, it woul have to be apportione accoring to the extent of the performance. The cases to this effect epen upon the analogous principle, that the venee in possession cannot i:esist the payment of the purchase money, or if allowe to set up a partial failure of consieration, a proportionate share of it, because he i not get all he contracte for. Sprite vs. Taylor, 5 Metcalf 61. Ayres vs. Pease, 12 Wen. 393. Skinner vs. White, 17 Johnson, 357. Dyer vs. Dorsey, 1 Gill & John. 440. Watts vs. Shepher, [2] Ala. 425. Gower vs. Saltmarsh, 11 Missouri 271. An in Bright vs. Rowlan, 3 Howar Miss. 398, the ecision against stipulate amages was influence by the supposition that, in the event of partial performance of an entire contract, the efenant woul remain subject to pay the entire amount stipulate, an which woul then become in the nature of a penalty.
The expression of Heath, J., in Astley vs. Welon, 2 Bos. & Pnl. 346, that “where articles contain covenants for the perform anee of several things, an then one large sum is state at the en, to be pai upon breach of performance, that must be consiere as a penalty,” though often quote, furnishes a rule of very limite application to such contracts. It is emonstrate by the subsequent cases in Englan that it is no objection to an agreement for stipulate amages, where there are several acts to be one or abstaine from, because they appear to vary in importance. Unless the right of parties so to contract is enie, the only effect of such a rule woul be to require parties to be more specific in making the stipulation apply to the breach of each separate unertaking. In Kemble vs. Farren, 6 Bingham 141, the agreement provie for mutual acts to be one, of ifferent egrees of importance, some of them being the payment of small sums of money by way of salary, with a clause, “that if either of the parties shoul neglect or refuse to fulfill the sai agreement, or any part thereof, or any stipulation therein containe, such party shoul pay to the other, the sum of 1000 L., to which sum it was thereby agree that the amages sustaine by such omission, neglect or refusal shoul amount: an which sum was thereby eclare by the sai parties to be liquiate an ascertaine amages, an not as a penalty, or penal sum, or in the nature of one.” The raughtsman of this instrument certainly ha eneavore to take the istinction averte to by L. Tenteren in Davis vs. Renton, between a penalty an liquiate amages, an though it was likene to Astley vs. Welon, C. J. Tinall, put the case upon the groun, equally applicable to Astley vs. Welon, that by it a large sum of money might become payable in consequence of the non-payment of a smaller sum. So that, however clear the intention of the parties might be, as expresse, it was not allowable for them to contract in that way. The ecision in Boys vs. Ancel, 5 Bing. N. C. 390, really turne upon the same istinction, because either party might have become liable to pay the sum of 500 L., as stipulate amages, in efault of paying a trifling amount, being his part of the expense of having the papers prepare. To the same effect is Horner vs. Flintoff, 9 Mees. & Welsby 678. In Atkyns vs. Kennear, 4 Exch. 776, the efenant was boun by the covenant to o an abstain from various things, an of varying importance, for any infringement of which he was to pay the plaintiff 1000?. as liquiate amages. The breach allege was, that the efenant, contrary to the agreement, ha resie within a prescribe istance. Parke B. thought that the covenant against mere resience within the prohibite limits, woul be goo, an it was immaterial whether the plaintiff ha sustaine any amage fi-om the breach of it or not, because the non-performance imports amage; an, he with the rest of the court, wholly isregare the circumstance that, in that case, some of the covenants seeme to be of minor importance, provie the amages resulting from any breach of them woul be uncertain, an the parties ha chosen to attach consequence to a breach of them, even to the extent of 10,000?.; because, as sai by Aeerson B., “We cannot say they are wrong inasmuch as the amages are uncertain.” While this case, on the whole, concees the authority of Kemble vs. Farren, by referring it to the principle that amages cannot be stipulate for the non-payment of a lesser sum; an upon the question of intention, that where the amount stipulate for the breach of several covenants is a penalty as to any one, it is to be construe as a penalty for all, it is a istinct, an strong affirmation of the untrammelle right of parties to stipulate for amages in all cases where it is lawful to o so.
There are some cases, an it woul be strange if there were none in a epartment of the law unergoing so many'transitions, which it woul be ifficult to reconcile or approve as preceents, upon any settle principle. Thus, of the case of Perrit vs. Wallis, 2 Dallas 252, it is to be inferre that the plaintiff claime an prove actual amages to an amount exceeing the penalty an isregaring it. In Hoag vs. McGinnis, 22 Wen. 163, an Spear vs. Smith, 1 Denio 464, stipulate amages, in the event of failure to abie an awar, were hel to be penalties, partly because it seeme an innovation upon the usual course of such submission, which the parties were presume to have intene to follow an partly because the sole object of the submission was to ascertain how much was ue from either party to the other, an so liquiate the amages in that moe, an which might prove to be a less sum than the amages stipulate. In Bair vs. Tollion, 6 Humph. 186, the efenants receive of the plaintiff four five per cent. State bons, to be returne within twelve months, orpay him $4,000. On a suspicion of usury, which was not pleae, the court appear to have treate the alternative sum as a penalty, though in the absence of any proof showing that the transaction was a cover for usury, it woul be questionable if it ought to have been presume, because, whether the receipt of the four thousan ollars, in State bons, was a loan or sale of them, on time, the transaction might be a fair one, as an exchange of securities, where the plaintiff lost the interest, an the efenant ’took upon himself the risk of appreciation of the State bons.Accoring to the authority of that case there were lurking penalties in Gregory vs. Bewley, 5 Ark. 318, Hoys vs. Tuttle, 3 Eng. 125, an Bizzell vs. Blevins, ib. 138, where the substance of the contract was to pay a certain amount of Arkansas Bank notes, • by a given time, an in efault of oing so; to pay a like sum in. money, an they were hel to be unertakings in the alternative-to eliver property or pay money.
The ebatable groun is, whether parties will be allowe to1 stipulate for amages, where from the nature of the act to be one or omitte, the amages are uncertain, though not in their nature wholly uncertain or even ifficult of ascertainment or approximation; such as executory contracts for the sale or lease of realty, or to eliver chattels. The ifficulty arises out of those cases where the courts have unertaken to juge of the contract, whether the sum stipulate be reasonable or unreasonable for the parties to have agree to, an presume their intention to have been accoringly. Dennis vs. Cummins, 3 John. cases 297, Curry vs. Larer, 3 Barr. 340, Spencer vs. Tilen, 5 Cowen 144, aopte in Watts vs. Shepher, an Perkins vs. Lyman, are of that character. In Spencer vs. Tilen, although the contract was not usurious, the extraneous facts ha been brought before the-court, uner a plea of usury, an no oubt influence the ecision. In Perkins vs. Lyman it is intimate that in the construction of contracts, in orer to etermine between a penalty an liquiate amages, the court may be aie by circumstances extraneous to the writing. We apprehen there ought to be no ifference between this an any other species of contract, where the writing furnishes the rule of interpretation, subject to the explanation of latent ambiguities, or the meaning of the wors with reference to any local usage. If a efenant coul show a clear case of stipulate amages to be a penalty, he coul only o so on the principle that a party may go into equity to have a conitional sale establishe as a mortgage. When the execution of the contract is enie, or it is impeache for want of consieration, or for usury, for overreaching or frau in any of its protean shapes, all the attenant circumstances an inucements-are opene for proof, an then, any apparent inequality or gross unfairness on the face of the contract, woul ai the proof of extrinsic facts in orer to raise the presumption of frau.
The argument for the exercise of such a iscretion by the courts is, that the price agree to be pai for the property, an which also has a market value, furnishes a reay stanar accoring to which the purchaser can be compensate for the loss of his bargain. It woul be true that, where the amages stipulate to be pai to the venor excees the price agree upon for the property, it woul be voi as a compensation, an coul only stan as a penalty for the non-payment of a lesser sum. That was the case in Moore vs. Platt, 8 Missouri 467. But the case of Glosson vs. Beale, 7 John. 72, seems to go an extreme length 'the other way. There the efenant sol the plaintiff a tract of lan for $500, an agree to make him a goo title to it within a year, or in lieu thereof to pay him $800. There the contract ha been execute on the part of the plaintiff, by the payment of the purchase money, an the ecision that he was entitle to recover the $800 as liquiate amages, coul perhaps be uphel on the supposition that the venor meant to stipulate a certain amount of amages, in case the title faile, to cover improvements mae by the venee uring the year, instea of a return of the purchase money with interest, the orinary measure of a breach of warranty, an in that view it was a proper subject for stipulate amages.
The argument state coul only affect the stipulation for amages to be pai to the venor who ha agree to sell the property for its amitte value. But in Reilly vs. Jones, 1 Bing. 302. Tingley vs. Cutler, 7 Conn. 291, an Grammon vs. Howe, 14 Maine 250, upon agreements to lease or sell, the actions were brought by the party unertaking to lease or sell, an stipulate, amages recovere for failure to pay the purchase money, an without any enquiry whether the sum stipulate bore a reasonable proportion to the value of the property, although in stipulating the amages, the parties ha provie a moe for the cancellation of the agreement, an the plaintiff woul not only recover the amages, but keep his property. That the purchaser may recover stipulate amages for the non-compliance of the party unertaking to sell or lease, is well establishe. Knapp vs. Maltby, 13 Wen. 587. Chamberlain vs. Bagley, 11 N. Hamp. 234. Brewer vs. Egerly, 13 ib. 275. Mea vs. Wheeler, ib. 351. Hasbrook vs. Tappan, before cite. Jenkins vs. Yates, 2 J. J. Marsh. 49. Hamilton vs. Overton, 6 Black. 206.
An there is no goo reason why the like rule shoul not apply to agreements for the sale or elivery of chattels of any particular escription by a ay certain! If for example, the contractor to buil a ship may subject himself to the payment of stipulate amages, by way of emurrage, for failing to have it complete by the time specifie, he ought to have the power to stipulate in like manner with those who may unertake to furnish the materials, that are to enter into its construction.
Our impression is, that wherever the act to be one or abstaine from, is other than the payment of money, the circumstance that the actual amages may be more or less easily susceptible of ascertainment, ought not to influence the construction of an •agreement to be one way .or the other, a stipulation for amages or merely by way of penalty, Where the amages are at all uncertain or unliquiate, the parties ought to be allowe to anticipate an stipulate them if they choose to o so. Whenever courts attempt to take a istinction among contracts of this class, where no uniform or intelligible rule can be lai own to govern the istinction, they not only assume a most vexatious jurisiction to reform the contracts of weak or sanguine men, but it tens to impair the confience which all men ought to have in the obligation of contracts.
The strong esire of mankin to be permitte to act as free agents rebelle against the course of ecision which isarme a penalty of its terror, an as it cease to affor a security for the performance of a contract, they resorte to agreements for stipulate amages, which uner the iea of a compensation, grew up •to be recognize as legitimate. The truth is, the real object of every stipulation for consequential amages, is to secure the performance of the contract itself, an but for the confusion of terms, it woul be proper to say, that covenants to pay a certain amount of amages for the breach of any unertaking have, to the extent that they are allowable, taken the place of penalties; the only broa istinction being, an which prevails in chancery as .at law, between penalties or forfeitures for the non-payment of money, an those which are incurre by the failure to perform any other collateral act.
Upon the case presente by the recor here for ajuication, our conclusion, but with some hesitation, is, that accoring to any fair construction of the instrument sue upon, an in view of the rules of interpretation furnishe by the ecisions to which we have averte, the plaintiff is entitle to recover the sum of five hunre ollars as stipulate amages. The wor “forfeiture,” in the connection where it is use, obviously means a failure to comply with the agreement. It is true the parties have not use the term, stipulate or liquiate amages, expressive of a clear intention to negative the iea of a penalty; but on the other han, the instrument hasnottheform of apenalbon, where the sum specifie woul excee, being usually ouble the amount or value of the subject to which the contract relate; an on the whole, we think these parties intene that the sum of five hunre ollars was to be pai by either party to the other, as an agree compensation for such amages as woul result from a refusal to comply with the trae. The price of the lan was not to be pai in money, but in merchanize, some of it at the original cost, an in mules at a cash valuation. The plaintiif coul not be expecte to show by evience what profits he might have mae by the resale of the goos an the mules, or what other losses he may have sustaine by so entire a isappointment in his contemplate arrangements. The series of acts to be one by either party, mae up but one entire whole, which was the consumnjation of the trae. If at liberty to o so, we coul not unertake to say that the sum here specifie is unreasonable or isproportionate to the value of the property which, by the terms of the contract, was to be exchange.
The jugment will be reverse, an the cause remane with instructions that the emurrer be overrule, an the cause further proceee in accoring to law, an not inconsistent with this opinion.",legal_case
1862711,Allen vs. Allen,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker,
elivere the opinion of the Court.
Louisa H. Allen, by her next frien, file her bill for a ivorce an for alimony against her husban, Abraham Allen; to which he file his answer enying the allegations therein, an set forth by way of cross bill, a complaint, in which he allege a breach of the marriage contract, on the part of the complainant, which she was calle upon to answer, an for a ecree in his favor.
For all substantial purposes the answer is a cross bill, an uner our practice in chancery, must be so consiere. It appears that at the instance of the complainant, the court ha orere the efenant to pay the next frien, for the temporary support of the complainant, a sum of money at state perios, which orer the efenant, for several grouns set forth in his motion, move the court to set asie; one of the reasons for setting asie the orer was, that the next frien was insolvent. The court refuse to vacate the orer, but orere that the next frien give security for costs on or before the secon ay of the next term of the court, or that the suit shoul be ismisse. At the next term of the court, the next frien file his written statement, in which he ecline to comply with the orer of court, an expresse a willingness that the suit shoul be ismisse. To this the efenant objecte an offere to waive the necessity for giving security in obeience to the orer of court. But the court isregare his objection an ismisse both the original an the cross bill, to which the efenant excepte an appeale to this court.
There can be no oubt uner the state of case, but that the court erre in ismissing the suit. The efenant i not move the court to ismiss the suit; nor i he consent that it shoul be one; an uner the circumstances ofthe case, even if the complainant ha formally move the court to o so, the statute expressly eclares that, after a cross bill is file, the complainant shall not, without the consent of the efenant, ismiss the suit. Dig. ch. 28, sec. 41. But in this case the suit was not ismisse at the instance of either party, but by orer of court. We will not say that a state of case might not arise, where, by the acts of the parties in the prosecution of a suit, or in failing or refusing to comply with the orers of the court, that the court might not orer the suit to be ismisse; but uner the state of casé here presente, we are satisfie that the court erre in ismissing the suit against the objection of the efenant.
The orer an ecision of the court ismissing the suit must be reverse an set asie, an the cause remane with instructions to reinstate the case upon the ocket, that the same may be hear upon its merits.",legal_case
1862613,Price vs. The State Bank,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins
elivere the opinion of the court.
The case here is, that the Bank exhibite her petition, uner .the statute, against the appellant, alleging, that he, being inebte to her by note, in orer to secure the payment of the same, execute his ee of mortgage to her of certain horses, an also of a tract of lan, that the mortgage was uly acknowlege an recore, an that consistently with its stipulations, the efenant Price, ha continue in possession of the mortgage property real an personal; that the ebt remaine wholly unpai, an the conition of the ee ha become forfeit: an praying jugment for the amount of the ebt, with interest specifie in the note an secure by the mortgage; that the efenant’s equity of reemption in the mortgage property might be foreclose, an the property ecree to be sol, an the procees applie to the payment of the ebt.
Price answere, amitting the inebteness, an that he execute the mortgage, as allege, in goo faith, to secure the same; but that since its execution, the horses in question ha ie from isease while in his possession, without any fault or neglect of his; an that previous to the execution of the mortgage, one Charles Lewis ha obtaine a jugment against him, in the Circuit Court of the Unite States, for the Arkansas District, which was a lien upon the real estate escribe in the mortgage, an of which he was not aware at the time he execute it; that since then one Louis Refel ha become the purchaser, an was in possession of the lan uner execution ha of the jugment in the Feeral Court, an submitting that Refel was a necessary party to the suit.
The complainant then exhibite an amenment to her bill, against Price an Refel, alleging that Refel’s purchase was a sham, an collusive; that Refel ha bought the lan with the money of Price, or hel it by some secret agreement in trust for him. To this, the efenants answere, enying the frau an combination charge; averring that the purchase by Refel was in all respects fair an not colorable. Refel set out his title uner the Marshal’s sale, by virtue of which he ha obtaine control of the lan, an relie on his title as a efence to the bill.
At the hearing, upon bill, answer, replication an exhibits, it appearing that Refel hel the lan by title superior to the mortgage, the bill was ismisse as to him; an because of the estruction of the personal property, no ecree of foreclosure coul be renere; but the court ecree against the efenant, Price, that the complainant recover of him the amount of the ebt an interest intene to be secure by the mortgage, an which remaine unpai.
Upon the appeal of Price from this ecree, it is contene for him, that the statutory remey for foreclosure, if aopte, must be strictly pursue; an that whenever it appeare uring the progress of the suit, that foreclosure coul not be ecree because of the estruction of the personal property, an the failure of the mortgagor’s title to the realty, the bill shoul have been ismisse for want of jurisiction, the complainant for the mere recovery of her ebt having a plain an aequate remey at law.
Upon the reaing of the statute, Digest, Title, Mortgages, it woul seem ifficult to etermine whether the framers of it intene the proceeing to foreclose mortgages shoul be ha in a court of law or a court of chancery. Yet we think, as hel in McLain & Bagett vs. Smith, 4 Ark. 246, that it is essentially a chancery proceeing, because, as now constitute, a court of chancery can, an a court of law cannot give effect to all the remeies contemplate by it. Without making any question whether the legislature, uner the constitution, can eprive chancery of any of its peculiar jurisiction, see Hempstea an Conway vs. Watkins, 1 Eng. 357, or may not invest courts of law with chan-/ eery powers, the present statute oes not inten to o either, but rather to enlarge the jurisiction of chancery.
The substantial provisions of the statute are, that mortgagees of real or personal estate, may procee by petition in the Circuit Court, against the mortgagor, an the actual occupiers of any of the real estate, setting out the mortgage, praying that jugment may be renere for the ebt, an that the equity of reemption may be foreclose, an that the mortgage property may be sol to satisfy the amount ue. All persons claiming an interest in the mortgage property may be mae efenants, an may plea any lawful matter in avoiance of the ee or ebt. If upon trial, the mortgage money appears to be unpai, the court is to rener jugment for the ebt, interest an costs, an make an orer that the specific mortgage property be sol, or so much as will be sufficient to satisfy the amount ue. Upon this jugment or ecree, a special writ of fieri facias issues escribing the property, an commaning that it be sol to satisfy the mortgage ebtso ajuge. The mortgagor has, in all cases, until the ay of sale uner the execution to reeem the mortgage premises, by paying the amount ue. The jugment or ecree, as in other cases, is a general lien from its renition upon the real estate of the mortgagor. If, upon the return of the special fieri facias, it appears that the mortgage property faile to prouce satisfaction of the ebt, an execution may issue for the resiue as on orinary jugments.
This statute, so far from afforing a harsh remey an to be strictly construe, as one in erogation of the common law, ought to be favore an liberally construe: because it affors a remey at once simple an comprehensive, efficacious for the mortgagee, an equitable for the mortgagor.
The statute oes not take away, but its policy is to iscourage, in practice, the common law right of the mortgagee to bring his action at law for the ebt. Because, if the mortgagee obtains an inepenent jugment at law, the result might be exceeingly harsh an oppressive, if he be allowe to subject the estate of the ebtor to the “sweeping esolation of an execution at law,” without exhausting the mortgage property, which the one ha given an the other accepte as security for the ebt. So, if the execution be levie on the mortgage property, the question woul arise whether the sale bars the equity of reemption, or whether the purchaser acquires the property ischarge from or subject to the-mortgage; either way, the property is sol uner the clou of the subsisting mortgage, an a oor is open for the commission of fraus to evae a sacrifice of property. Although the common law octrine of strict foreclosure is unknown to our law, or never resorte to in practice, yet the effect might be the same if the mortgagee can become the purchaser of the equity of reemption, uner his jugment at law for the mortgage ebt, an so unite in himself the equitable an the legal estate.
But the statute carries out all the liberal notions of the law oí mortgages entertaine at the present ay. The mortgagor has the benefit of a fair public sale of the mortgage premises, with assurance to the purchaser of a clear title, all the parties in interest having been before the court. The mortgagee has the benefit of the general lien of his jugment or ecree for tbe ebt, an, if this be not satisfie by the sale of the mortgage property, he can at once sue out an orinary execution for the resiue, without being remitte to a court of law, to complete his remey by obtaining a jugment in personam against the mortgagor for such resiue.
In McLain & Bagett vs. Smith, the matter ecie was, thatii it be mae to appear that there is a tenant in possession, not a party, the court will require him to be mae a efenant, an or. failure of the complainant to comply with the orer, will ismiss the bill. Apart from the statute, the same rule of ecision will apply to all other persons intereste in the subject of the litigation, if susceptible of being mae parties.
The report of the case of Jett vs. Cave & Schaffer, 5 Ark. 244, is, that a ecree was entere up for the amount of the ebt an costs, an that the mortgage property be sol to satisfy it; an this court reverse the ecree, because it i not foreclose or bar the equity of reemption as praye for in the petition, an which was thought to be an inispensable requisite of the statute. We must conclue that the opinion in that case was not well consiere. It may be oubte whether the statute contemplates any formal ecree of foreclosure, in orer to bar the equity of reemption, (see sec. 13,) an if it oes, whether the ecree for the ebt, an for the sale of the property to satisfy it, is not a substantial compliance with the law. This point is much iscusse, though without reference to any such statutory provision in the case of Lansing vs. Goelet, 9 Cowen 347. An if the omission to enter a formal ecree of foreclosure be not a compliance with the statute,, it is ifficult to see how the mortgagor coul complain of it as erroneous. The ecision there eviently procees on the groun that the statute affors a remey to be strictly pursue. Our views of the statute are altogether ifferent. It is the only statute regulating the law of mortgages in this State. It is to be' apprehene that many unfortunate consequences woul follow, if without such a controling statute, we shoul have to fall back upon the common law an the statutes of Englan, prior to the fourth year of James the First, to etermine the rights growing, out of such contracts.
Conceing the general proposition contene for by the appellant, that the efenant in chancery may object for the want of jurisiction, because the complainant ha an aequate remey at law, by answer as well as by emurrer, an that the complainant may be turne out of court if the want of jurisiction appear from the proofs at the hearing, else the submission of the parties to the forum might operate as a frau upon the jurisiction; yet, it shoul be borne in min, that the evil to be guare against is not so much the resort to chancery in the first instance, for relief, which a court of law can as well an more expeitiously affor; but it is the increase of litigation, the vexation an elay of a resort to chancery, to be relieve against jugments at law, where the complainant might have availe himself of the same groun of efence.
But the objection taken by the appellant is not tenable upon what we conceive to be the proper construction of the statute,the esign of which is to confer upon chancery a jurisiction it ha not before, viz : that of renering a jugment in personam for the mortgage ebt, an of enforcing it as an orinary jugment at law, if not satisfie after exhausting the mortgage property by sale uner the ecree of foreclosure. True, the mortgagee connot go into chancery, an ask merely for a ecree or jugment for his ebt. But on the face of this bill an exhibits the court of chancery ha jurisiction to ecree foreclosure as well as to rener jugment for the ebt. Upon the suggestion of the appellant, the averse rights of a thir party were brought before the court, thus calling into exercise one of the peculiar powers of equity jurisiction. In orer to etermine that the complainant was not entitle to a ecree of foreclosure an sale of the realty as against Refel, it necessarily took cognizance of the cause an i ajuicate it.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was a bill in chancery, file by Lovette an wife, to enjoin the sale of certain slaves taken in execution to satisfy a jugment obtaine by Longmire against Lovette. The slaves are claime by the wife as her separate property, uner the provisions of the Statute, Digest, chapter 104, which, in certain cases exempts slaves an other property owne by the wife at the time of her marriage, or which comes to her uring coverture, from sale, for the payment of the husban’s ebts.
It appears from the facts isclose that on the 13th of May, 1846, Longmire obtaine jugment in the Union Circuit Court, against Lovette, in ebt for $522 50, besies interest an costs. On the first ay of December, 1847, the slaves taken in execution came to the possession of Lovette an wife by inheritance, from Elizabeth Jamieson, the mother of Mrs. Lovette. On the 7th of November, 1848, uner the provisions of the 7th section of the act approve December 8th, 1846, above referre to, a scheule of the property so inherite, incluing the slaves levie upon, was file in the Recorer’s office, of the county of Union, it being the county in which Lovette an wife live an hel the property. On the 22 of March, 1850, the slaves were taken in execution,, to enjoin the sale ‘of which this suit was brought.
There is no oubt but that the slaves were inherite by the wife, an- hel by her uner the provisions of the act of 1846, uner a substantial compliance with the provisions of that statute. u
But the question is, whether the statute exempts them from, liability for the payment of this ebt, which was contracte before the estate veste in Mrs. Lovette, an before the scheule-was file in the Recorer’s office.
The first section of the act permits the wife to hol property,, real or personal, by bequest, evise, gift or istribution in her own right an for her own use, except such as may come from the husban after coverture. The secon section continues the title of slaves in the wife which she hel at the time of her marriage, notwithstaning her coverture, an allows her to hol an possess the same as her separate property, exempt from any liability for the ebts or contracts of the husban. The thir section confers a like right to property thus acquire before the passage of the act from the payment of ebts contracte after its passage. The 9th section provies that “before any marrie woman can avail herself of the privileges an benefits of this act she an her husban shall make out a scheule of the property erive through her, uner oath, which shall be verifie by the oath of some other reputable person, which scheule shall be file in the Recorer’s office, of the county within which the property is, as well as in which they live.” An then the 8th an last section provies that “the operation of this act shall not interfere with the collection of ebts alreay contracte by any marrie man, or which shall hereafter be contracte before the filing of the scheule referre to in the preceing section.” These are the material provisions of the statute, an although the secon section provies in general terms, that the wife shall hol such property exempt from any liability for the payment of the ebts or contracts of the husban, still the 8th an last section in express terms, eclares that this act shall not interfere with the collection of ebts alreay contracte by a marrie man, or which shall afterwars be contracte before the scheule provie for in the 7th section shall have been file, which filing is a pre-requisite to the enjoyment of the benefits of the act. In the case uner consieration tbe ebt was not only contracte before the passage of the act, an consequently the filing of the scheule uner it, but also before the inheritance escene to the wife, an therefore comes irectly within the provisions of the 8th section, unless we coul, as contene for by the appellants, construe this section so as to make it apply to contracts entere into upon the faith an creit of this property whilst in the joint possession of the husban an wife, an before the scheule ha been file, as require by the provisions of the 7th section. But the 6th an 8th sections were eviently intene as limitations upon the general terms of the secon section, particularly the 8th, which is clear an explicit in its terms, an is esigne to limit the operation of the preceing sections. There is nothing ambiguous or oubtful in the language use, an when such is the case there is no room for construction ifferent from the plain language use. It follows, therefore, from the conclusions at which we have arrive, that the slaves, although no oubt exempt from the payment of ebts contracte by the husban after the scheule of the slaves ha been file in the Recorer’s office, were nevertheless liable to the payment of this, it being a ebt contracte before the passage of the act of 1846, uner which the wife claims protection for the property.
Inepenant of this fatal objection to the relief praye for by the complainants, their bill was upon its face emurrable. Amit the slaves to have been theseparate property of complainant, (the wife), that they were family slaves, value on account of long an faithful servitue, above all reasonable compensation in amages, an that one of them was inhumanly separate from her infant chil, still the sale of them by the sheriff woul not eprive Mrs. Lovette of a full an aequate reress at law against the purchaser for possession of the slaves. It is not allege that by reason of the sale they woul be place beyon the reach of process at law, an as the question of the sufficiency of the bill to entitle the complainant to equitable relief, was specially re^ serve in the efenant’s answer; upon that groun, as well as the first, that the slaves were subject to the payment of Long-mire’s ebt, the court below shoul have ecree against the complainants.
As a matter of practice, the ecree of the Circuit Court shoul have been simply to issolve the injunction an ismiss the complainant’s bill, leaving the sheriff to execute his common law process of sale. Beyon this, from the state of the pleaings, the Cir j cuit Court ha no power to ecree relief. The ecree of the Union Circuit Court, so far as regars the issolution of the injunction an the ismissal of the complainant’s bill was certainly correct. But so far as regars the specific relief ecree, it was clearly erroneous an must, for that error, be set asie an reverse with costs; an a ecree renere in this court in accorance with the opinion herein elivere.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of replevin in the cepit for a slave. The* efenant pleae non cepit; property in himself in right of his-wife, in right of his wife jointly with plaintiff, in right of his wife jointly with a thir person, in right of his wife jointly with the-plaintiff an others, an also property in a thir person; in each-of them traversing the plaintiff’s title.
To each of these pleas the plaintiff file two replications. In-his secon replication-, without setting up an absolute title, or right of property, or possession in himself, he replie that he ha title to the slave as one of the heirs of Laura Ann Brashaw, an J. also, as one of the heirs of Sarah McGinnis, an also as legatee uner the will of Sarah McGinnis, an that before an at the time when, &c., he was in peaceable possession of the slave, with the assent of Wooruff, the executor of sai will.
To these replications the efenants emurre, an the court,, upon consieration, sustaine the emurrer, an this ecision is-assigne as error an will be first consiere.
The several pleas, except the sixth plea, set up title in the e-fenant, or in the efenant jointly with others, an each con-elues with a traverse of the plaintiff’s title to the property. The-injustice of the caption, which is the gist of the action, is by these-pleas avoie, b3r showing that the efenant ha a right to take the property. »
The material fact put in issue is property in the efenant, an consequently the replication must sustain the title, not the mere possessory title, but the absolute title. It is true that possession by the plaintiff an a wrongful taking by the efenant will entitle the plaintiff in the first instance to maintain his action, but when, as Baron Gilbert says, (Treatise on the law of Replevin 132) the efenant pleas property in himself, he avois the injustice of the caption, which is the gist of the action, by showing that he ha a right to take it. To such plea the plaintiff replies, not merely a possessory title, unless connecte with such facts as woul show a right of ominion an control, even against him who has the legal title; but he must reply such facts as show title in himself. The case of Rogers vs. Arnol, 12 Wen. Rep. 36, is very strongly in point. The action was replevin, for taking mill irons; pleas, non cepit, property in efenants an another; property in themselves as tenants in common with the plaintiff; property in themselves as tenants in common with the plaintiff an another; property in themselves; an property in one of them. When consiering the effect of these pleas, the court sai “ All these pleas are obviously foune upon the principle applicable to"" this action, that the plaintiff, as in trover, must recover upon the strength of his title to, or property in the goos in question.” An again, upon the same question, the court sai “ It is a goo plea in this action that the property is in the plaintiff an the efenant, or a stranger; an where there are two plaintiffs, it is in one of them. Here it is shown to be in the plaintiff an one of the efenants, which isproves the issues in the case, that the plaintiff is the exclusive owner. It is not material that the efenant shoul prove title to the property, as set forth in any one plea, as that is only inucement to the-traverse of the plaintiff’s title, as has been before shown, an nee not be, an was not enie in the replication. Upon the issue the plaintiff was boun to prove an maintain an exclusive right to the possession an control of the property.”
This ecision is well sustaine by numerous authorities, an from the principle lai own it follows, that as the plaintiff, uner such issue, is boun to prove an exclusive right to possession an control, which can only exist where he has the absolute title an exclusive title to the property, or hols uner one who has such title, he must, when he replies to such plea, set up matter which, if proven, woul uphol an sustain his right to an exclusive right of possession an control of the property. This, we think, the replications fail to o. They neither assert an exclusive right of possession in the plaintiff, nor in one uner whom he hel possession, but assert a joint property in the slave as heir of certain iniviuals, an uner the will of one of them as legatee, an that they ha possession, with the assent of the executor of the will of one of the two, uner whom plaintiff an efenants set up title. This clearly gave no right to an exclusive possession, because it only showe a joint tenancy, or a tenancy in common with others.
Littleton says, “ If two be possesse of chattels personal in common by ivers titles, as of a horse, or ox, or cow, if one takes the whole to himself, out of the possession of the other, the other hath no remey, but to take this from him, who hath one him the wrong to occupy in common, &c., when he can see his time, &c.” An Lor Coke, commenting thereon, says, “ If one tenant in common take all the chattels personal, the other hath no remey by action, but he may take them again. Co. Litt. 200 a. An to this effect is the ecision of the court in Rogers vs. Arnol, 12 Wen. 30, an McElerry vs. Flannagan, 1 Har. & Gill, 308. An this question was expressly ecie in Robinson vs. Calloway, 4 Ark. Rep. 95.
The replications to the several pleas setting up property in the efenant, or in the efenant with others, were insufficient, an the emurrer to them correctly sustaine.
As regars the 6th plea, which sets up title in Wooruff, as executor of the will of Sarah McGinnis — if the plaintiff ha replie a special property an right of possession uner Wooruff, we are not prepare to say that such replication woul not have been goo; but we cannot consier the replication as relying upon a hire, or right of possession erive through any contract for a limite estate in the slave, but as showinghow he acquire possession uner his title as heir an legatee; an consequently the replication to this plea was also insufficient, an the emui’rer to it properly sustaine.
The next question is as to the amissibility, as evience, of a paper purporting to be a bill of sale to Sarah Brashaw, for her chilren, Sarah an Laura, through whom the efenants claim title to the slave. The paper offere in evience purporte to be a copy of the recor of a bill of sale to Sarah Brashaw for her infant chilren, recore in the office of the Parish Juge, an is certifie by him as a true copy from the recors in his office ; to which is appene the certificate of the Governor of Louisiana, that James J. Weems, who certifie the copy, was, at the time of signing the same, Parish Juge, for the Parish of West Feliciana, in sai State : that his signature is genuine, an that faith an creit are ue to his official acts as such.
The bill of sale purports to have been taken before Joseph Bernar, a notary public for the Parish of Feliciana, in sai State, an was no otherwise proven or authenticate as the act of the parties. To the reaing of this paper the plaintiff objecte, an thereupon the efenant, as a founation for reaing sai paper writing in evience, an against the objection of the plaintiff, prouce a pamphlet entitle “ Acts passe at the first session of the 14th Legislature of the State of Louisiana, begun an hel in the city of New Orleans, January 7th, 3 839.” An for the same purpose, against the objection of the plaintiff, prouce a book with a title page, as follows : “Civil Coe of the State of Louisiana, with annotations by Wheelock S. Upton, L. L. D., an Neil R. Jennings. By authority. New Orleans. E. Johnson & Co. Stationers’Hall, 1838.” Upon the prouction of this act an civil coe, or that which purporte to be the Civil Coe of Louisiana, an uner authority of the contents thereof, the court overrule the objection, both to the reaing of the pamphlet acts an the civil coe, an also to the amissibility of the paper purporting to be a copy of the recor of sai Parish court, an permitte the same to be rea to the jury as evience.
By the 2 section, ch. 66, Dig. stat. p. 490, it is provie, “That the printe statute books of the several States an Territories of the Unite States, purporting to have been printe uner the authority of such State or Territory, shall be evience of the legislative acts of such States or Territories.” Uner this statute we perceive no objection to the introuction of the act passe at the session of 1839, on account of the eviences of its authenticity, as an act of the Louisiana legislature. But then it cannot be sai to be authority for making the paper offere in evience matter of recor; because the act is prospective, an was passe some fifteen years or more after the ate an recor entry of the paper offere in evience. Nor can the pamphlet offere as the civil coe come in ai of this act; because it i not purport to be a statute book of the State of Louisiana, printe uner the authority of that State, nor i it appear to have been aopte by any act of the Legislature of the State as a coe of laws of the State. The act touching this civil coe only authorize the Governor to purchase, for the use of the State, one thousan copies of a new eition of the civil coe of Louisiana, propose to be publishe by E. Johns & Go., provie that the Governor shoul be satisfie with the manner in which the Work shoul be one, an further, that sai eition shall be carefully collate with the original manuscript, &c. Now there is no evience whatever, that the pamphlet offere was one of Johns & Go’s», new eition of the civil coe, or that it ever was examine, compare, or approve by the Governor, or that he was satisfie with the manner in which it was one. An even if all this ha appeare, there is no provision in the act for aopting this as part of'the coe of laws of the State of Louisiana, or of the laws heretofore existing. It simply provies for the purchase of a thousan copies for the use of the State. The court below erre, therefore, in permitting the pamphlet; purporting to be the civil coe of Louisiana, to be rea.
Returning to the paper offere as a copy of the recor, It is evL ent that it was inamissible as evience, because it was neither shown to be acknowlege before any officer competent to take such acknowlegment, an was sprea upon the recor of the Parish court without authority of law. In the case of Wilson vs. Royston, 2 Ark. 328, the authentication of the ee by acknowlegement before a notary public, with certificate, as well as that of the Governor of the State, showing that the notary was uly commissione, &c.; was hel insufficient evience to authorize the reaing of the ee in evience in this State.
We think, uner the circuinstances of the case, that the court below erre in permitting the paper, purporting to be a bill of sale, an tening in connection with other evience to prove title in the efenant, or thir persons, to be rea in evience to the jury. An for this error the jugment an ecision of the Circuit Court must be reverse, an the cause remane for further proceeings therein, to be ha accoring to law, an not inconsistent with this opinion.
