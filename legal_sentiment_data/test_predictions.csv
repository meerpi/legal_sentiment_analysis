1862618,The State Bank vs. Fowler and Pike,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins
elivere the opinion of the court.
This suit was commence on the 6th ay of September, 1849, on a promissory note mae by the efenants, together with Thomas J. Lacy, an G. N. Causin, ate 24th February, 1843, an payable to the plain tiff one year after ate. It will be necessary to state only so much of the pleaings an evience as will show istinctly the questions presente on the recor.
The efenants severally, pleae that the cause of action ha not accrue within three years next before the commencement of the suit. The plaintiff replie that on the 23 ay of September, 1845, Lacy, the principal ebtor, mae a partial payment upon the note to the plaintiff, an on the 26th ay of February, 1848, an within three years from the time of such payment, the plaintiff commence suit in tlie Pulaski Circuit Court, upon the note, against all the makers, the alias summons, issue in which suit, was serve upon the present efenants, an not serve upon the other efenants, Lacy an Causin, who ha eparte this life; an in the progress of that suit, the efenant, Fowler, having file his plea in abatement of the alias writ of summons, the plaintiff emurre to the plea, an the emurrer being submitte the court, there, on the 23 ay of June, 1849, overrule the emurrer, an Hie plaintiff eclining to reply to sai plea, an electing to rest on her sai emurrer, the court then an there ajuge that the efenants go hence without ay, an recover of the plaintiff their costs in that behalf expene, as woul appear by the-recor, &c., an that afterwars, on the Cth ay of September, 1849, an within one year after the sai last mentione jugment, the plaintiff commence the present suit against these efenants.
To this replication the efenants severally emurre, because5 it i not appear that the plaintiff ha suffere a non suit in the5 former action, so as to bring her within the saving clause of the5 statute. These emurrers being overrule, the efenant, Pike,, reste; an Fowler rejoine, 1st, enying the fact of part payment by Lacy ; 2, that there was no such recor of the former suit as allege in the replication.
Upon the trial of the issues to Fowler’s rejoiners, it appeare; to the court that there was such a recor. But, in-orer to prove5 the fact of the part payment by Lacy, the Bank offerre in evience her books, kept at the time by A. E. Thornton, her Financial Receiver, or Cashier, in liquiation, proving in connection therewith, that Thornton was such receiver on the 2 of September, 1845, an ha the charge an custoy pf the books, recors,, accounts an notes of the Bank: that he ha left Arkansas after the institution of the present suit, an about a year previous to the trial; that he ha gone to parts unknown, an that since his eparture, he ha been an was beyon the process an jurisiction of this court. The books of the Bank showe the part payment by Lacy, at the time allege in the replication, the entry being as prove, in the han-writing of Thornton in the blotter, an poste by him into the leger. The court below exclue the Bank books an the proofs offere in connection therewith, as being incompetent evience.to prove the partial payment allege to have been mae by Lacy, an jugment went against the Bank, to reverse which she prosecutes this writ of error.
In the case of the State Bank vs. Magness, 6 Eng. 343, the plaintiff replie to the plea of the statute, that in a former action for the same cause, she was non-suit an sue again within the year; an the recor offere in support of this replication showe a jugment ismissing the suit, because the plaintiff, being-rule to file a bon for cost, faile to o so. The court there hel that the ismissal was, in effect a non-suit, an within the perview of the saving clause in the statute, an we are satisfie of the correctness of the ecision upon the facts of that case. But the opinion there woul seem to go to the length of holing, that wherever the plaintiff is not preclue by a ecision upon the merits from bringing another action, he comes within the meaning of the exception in the statute for limiting actions, an may bring a new suit within a year.
It is universally true, wherever it can be shown, accoring to the rules of law, that the merits of a suit have not been passe upon or etermine, the plaintiff is not estoppe by the ajuication, but may have a fresh action. This principle oes not etermine the plaintiff’s right to suspen or avoi the bar of the statute by suing again within the year, because that woul be giving an effect to the term “non-suit,” not warrante by any ajuge cases, an which the statute coul not have contemplate.
So, on the other han, it is true, that in orer for a plaintiff to have the benefit of this saving in the statute, it is not necessary that there shoul be a formal or technical jugment of non-suit. The plaintiff may iscontinue as to a part of the efenants, or he may suffer a iscontinuance of the action as to all, or he may ismiss, or submit to a ismissal of his suit. But in all such cases, wherever the proceeing of the court is equivalent to a non-suit, for the purpose of extening the time for bringing a fresh action, the iea is, that the plaintiff goes out of court voluntarily, or submits to the orer of the court requiring him to o so; an the court oes not ajuicate the cause, so that there is no final jugment to which a writ of error will lie, because the party cannot reverse a proceeing which he has sought or acquiesce in.
In this State, the non-suit, or a ismissal, or iscontinuance, ■ which is equivalent to it, must of necessity, be voluntary. It is settle here—see Martin an Van Horn vs Webb, 5 Ark. 72, ever since ahere to — that the plaintiff cannot, upon any avice or interposition of the court, be compelle to take a non-suit: but he has the right to insist that the court shall procee with his cause, an ajuicate it for or against him, an for no other conceivable object than to have final jugment given, to which he may prosecute his writ of error, if he choose to complain of the proceeings.
In the case now uner consieration, the plaintiff, when her emurrer to the plea in abatement of the writ in the former suit was overrule, ha the right to reply to the plea, if she thought proper to test the truth of it, or submitting to the emurrer to have sue out an alias writ, an so kept the same suit continuously on foot—see King vs. The State Bank, at January term, 1853 — or taken a non-suit, an accoring to the reason of the statute, a voluntary ismissal of the action woul have the same effect, in orer to enable her to sue again within the year. But when she electe to rest on her emurrer an procee no further, an so force the court to rener final jugment in favor of the efenants, it was an election on her part not to suffer a non-suit, but to take the chances of a reversal on error. A party thus situate, might not, inee, prosecute his writ of error, but rather choose to bring a new action, which he coul well o, because not preclue by any ajuication upon the merits. But the ajuication in question woul not, for that reason, be any the less final, an we coul not hol it to be a jugment of non-suit, without, at the same time, holing that a writ of error woul lie to a jugment of non-suit. Upon the principle contene for by the plaintiff in error, wherever a plaintiff eclines to amen, an final jugment goes upon emurrer sustaine to the eclaration, he woul come within the saving of the statute, as if having suffere a non-suit, because there was no such jugment as preclue another action, if rightly brought for the same cause.
We conclue therefore that there is no error in the jugment here, because the replication an the recor offere in proof of it, fail to show such a jugment of non-suit as woul avoi the bar set up in the plea.
It was, moreover, necessary for tbe plaintiff, in orer to avoi tbe bar, to couple the payment allege to have been mae by Lacy, with the former suit. Even if the court below erre in rejecting the evience offere to prove this payment, the jugment woul nevertheless, upon the whole recor, have to be affirme. But as to the proof of part payment no substantial ifference is perceive between this case an The State Bank vs. Barber et al. 7 Eng. 775, an no goo reason is shown why the ecision there ought not to he followe.

1862634,"Higgs, as admr. vs. Warner","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott
elivere the opinion of the Court.
Higgs, as aministrator, sue Warner, in assumpsit, for services renere by his intestate in his lifetime, as an attorney at law, an as an orinary agent, exhibiting a bill of particulars. Warner, besies the pleas of non-assumpsit an set-off, relie upon the plea of the statute of limitations. The replication to the latter plea, although taken in short on the recor by consent, we shall consier as a special one ; otherwise, the plaintiff’s case woul be at an en at once for want of appropriate allegations of the special facts, which he complains the court below refuse to allow him to prove by the evience he offere. The evience thus offere, an which the court refuse to permit the plaintiff to prouce to the jury, was, that of “ an account” file in the Probate Court, upon which Warner obtaine an allowance against the estate of the intestate, “ for ebts” ue by Hightower, the intestate, at the time of his eath, which bore ate an were charge within three years, next before the commencement of this suit. The object avowe by the plaintiff in offering this evience, was to prove by it that a mutual open account current, existe between Plightower, in his lifetime, an the efenant, Warner, this action having been brought, as the plaintiff alleges, to recover any balance that might be foun ue upon the-proper ajustment of such account, so as to bring his case within the provision of the 17th section of the statute of limitation (Dig.p. 698.) We have chosen to say that he offere to prove this fact of such a “ mutual open account current,” by this evience alone, because it is certifie to us by the court below, that the bill of exceptions in the recor, contains all the evience that was offere an rea to the jury on the trial of the cause, an we have examine the bill of exceptions closely, an fin in it no other, either offere an refuse, or actually prouce to the jury, which in the least conuces to prove any such “ a mutual open account current.” Uner such circumstances, then, i the court ¡below err in refusing to permit the plaintiff to rea the allege account in evience ?
To etermine this question we must ascertain the meaning of the section of the limitation act, just cite, in its connection with the other provisions of the statute'. Its own wors are its best exponent, that when an action shall be “ brought to recover any balance ue upon a mutual open account current, the cause of action shall be eeme to have accrue from the time of the last item prove in such account.” It was not to exempt open accounts current from the operation of the statute, not even when Such accounts were mutual, but to fix the point of time from which the statute woul begin to run on any such latter. Accoring to very common custom in this State, store accounts for goos sol, are ue the first ay of January following the year in which they are mae. From that time the statute orinarily begins to run upon them, the customer being suppose to have purchase with reference to this common custom, an therefore agreé to the maturity of the account at that time. Otherwise the general rule might apply, which is, in general, applicable to traesmen an artificers, &c., that the statute woul run from the ay of each article elivere, or piece of work one, an the continuation of the supply, or of the work one, woul not interrupt it; an iffering essentially from a uty which requires a continuation of services to complete the one act, as the uty of an attorney to commence an manage a suit. So the time for the closing of a mutual account current, might be stipulate for between the parties, either expressly or by implication, an the statute woul run on the balance from that ay, unless absorbe in a new mutual open account, in which the balance might form the first item. But if there be no stipulation between the parties, the statute enacts that the cause ofiaction shall be eeme to accrue from the ate of the last item. It is not, however, every open account current between parties, although they may severally have cross open accounts against each'other, that is a mutual one within the meaning of the statute. Such former woul of course be matter of set-off on either sie, an by agreement coul be converte into one inivisible open mutual account current; but unless by such agreement, either express or implie, they woul remain two several open accounts current, an not one entire inivisible mutual account, for which the balance only coul be proceee for, as contemplate by the section of the statute in question.
In the one mutual account current, contemplate by the statute, matters of set-off become converte eo instanti, into payment, an the balance only is recoverable. It is one consoliate transaction linke together, however numerous the items, by an alternative or correlative subsisting ebt on the one sie inucing the creit on the other. Agreement either express or implie, is of the very essence of such a mutual account current; because it is the act of the parties, an not the act of the law. The law but recognizes their act an carries out their intention as manifeste by their act. It oes not of its own force, convert cross ealings into one inivisible mutual account, but encourages gai’ties to o so, as it oes to use their cross emans as’set-off rather than institute an inepenent cross action upon them.
When, however, the parties elect to pursue the course of ealing contemplate by the statute, it necessarily results that any one item on either sie of the one mutual account woul raw to it every other item with which it was connecte by this chain of ealing, because in the view of the statutory provision-, we are consiering lire whole is one entire transaction. It coul not, however, possibly raw to it any item with which it was not so connecte for want of the essential element of the mutual agreement of the pai'ties. Analogous to a payment mae by a party who faile to exercise his right of appropriation, when making a payment to a creitor who hols two separate emans, one barre by the statute an the other not; an the creitor, in the exercise of his orinary right of appropriation, applies it in part liquiation of the stale eman, such woul not be a part payment within the statute, so as to revive the remey for want of the essential elements of appropriation by the ebtor.
Whether or not, then, in a case like this at bar, there was such a course of mutual ealings between the parties as is contemplate by the statute, is a material fact. An as such a course of ealings is foune upon the agreement of the parties, express or implie, an oes not necessarily follow', as the consequence of the fact, that each party may have an open account current against the other, there is no groun from which to presume such course of ealing, even prima facie from proof of the existence of a cross open account current, as there woul be to presume appropriation of a partial payment, mae generally to a creitor, who hel a subsisting eman ; because, in the latter case, in the absence of all repelling circumstances, the payment coul be referre to nothing else than to this subsisting eman, whereas, in the former case the creit given, which woul constitute the cross eman, might well enough, until the contrary shoul appear by facts or circumstances, be regare as a creit at large. In the usual course of ealings, men rarely pay money unless they owe it, whilst it is one of the most orinary circumstances in common life for a man to creit one he oes not owe.
If, therefore, the court ha permitte the evience in question to have gone to the jury,’unconnecte as it was with the proof of any other fact or circumstance, in any egree conucing to prove the existence of a mutual open account current, within the meaning of the statute, between the plaintiff’s intestate an the efenant, a verict foune upon it in favor of the plaintiff woul have been so utterly without evience to sustain it, that it coul not have been permitte to stan. So that even if we might think the evience in question competent as tening one step towars the establishment of the main fact, the burthen of which was upon the plaintiff to pr-ove, its exclusion uner the state of this case, as it appears upon the recor, in no way worke the prejuice of the plaintiff..
We .think, also, that there was no error in the court below to permit the reaing in evience, to prove the set-off, the “proceeings, recovery an recor,” as it appears by the bill of exceptions was allowe : an the jugment recovere in that court against the plaintiff, as aministrator, was, we think, a goo matter of set-off uner our statute. (Dig. ch. 150, sec. 2, 3.
We fin no error in the ruling of the court, either as to the instruction given, or those refuse. The ‘ruling as to these was substantially correct.
It was suggeste by the counsel for the appellee, that there was no question upon this recor for the consieration of this court, because, although the plaintiff below excepte to the ecision of the court overruling his motion for a new trial, he faile to have a bill of exceptions seale.
In the case of Berry vs. Singer, (5 Eng. R. at p. 490) we remarke that “ we woul not go the length that is apparently inicate in Sawyer vs. Lathrop (4 Eng. R. 67), of requiring that the evience shoul, in every case, be brought upon the recor, only after the overruling of a, motion for a new trial. On the contrary, we think that if it may have been brought regularly upon the recor before, an the recor shows istinctly that all the evience was so regularly of recor; as might well be one in exceptions that might be taken by bill to the giving or refusing to give instructions to the jury in orer to show the application or misapplication of the law to the facts, there woul be no more necessity in such case of reproucing such evience in the last bill of exceptions to the overruling of the motion for a new trial than there woul be to reconstruct any other part of the re-» cor. Because the waiver which is the result of a motion for a new trial, is no mutilation of the recor, proucing thereby any necessity for its reprouction in the last bill of exceptions, but simply a waiver of the right to insist upon exceptions taken uring the trial, as mere errors in law,” unless preserve by exceptions taken to the overruling of the motion for a new trial.
In the case at bar, all the evience prouce on the trial, an that which the court woul not allow to be prouce to the jury, as well as all the instructions given an refuse, are upon the recor regularly, an so is the motion for a new trial, an the exception of the appellant to the ecision of the court overruling his motion for a new trial. A bill of exceptions coul have therefore brought nothing more upon the recor than was alreay there; an that istinguishes this case from that of For vs. Clark, (7 Eng. R. 99), an several other cases.

1862647,Phelan ad. vs. Dalson,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott
elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was action of replevin in the etinet. There was but one count, an in this it was allege in the usual form, that the efenant ha receive the plaintiff’s horse, an although often requeste ha not elivere him, but unlawfully etaine him. It was commence against Malay in his lifetime, who having been afterwars kille by Dalson, his aministrator, Phelan, interpose three pleas: first, non etinet', an in the other two, setting up property an the right of possession in ecease, Malay. Upon these pleas issues were joine, an submitte to a jury, who foun for Dalson, an jugment was renere accoringly. A new trial was move on the part of the aministrator, upon the groun of allege exclusion of competent testimony an of misirection of the jury. This motion was refuse an the cause was brought here by appeal upon a bill of exceptions.
From this, it appears that the line of efence relie upon an attempte to be establishe, was that the unqualifie ownership in the horse in question, of the ecease Malay in his lifetime, was in no egree affecte by the allege purchase of Dalson; because that originate in frau, an was consummate by the felonious act of knowingly paying the purchase money in counterfeit gol coin. To this en, the aministrator, after proving by a witness, that in February, 1852, Dalson came to the house of the ecease an offere him ninety ollars in gol for the horse; that he then left the house of the ecease, taking the horse along with him, accompanie by the ecease; that the ecease returne home after a short time, an forthwith hane over to the witness ninety ollars in gol pieces, which the witness then unerstoo from the ecease, that he ha receive from Dalson in payment for the horse, then offere to prove by the same witness the following aitional facts : That the ecease, Malay, ha no other money in his house at that time : that he owe two ebts in the neighborhoo, one of fifty ollars an the other of forty-five ollars ; that about that time he pai these two ebts with five ollar gol pieces : that the persons to whom these two several payments were mae, ascertaine that the gol pieces pai over to them by Malay were counterfeit gol coin, an immeiately returne them to Malay, then in life: that soon'after these facts transpire, Dalson left the country, an took with him the horse in question: that he was pursue an arreste on a charge of passing feloniously, ninety ollars of counterfeit gol coin on the ecease, Malay, was brought back to the county where the allege offence was committe, an there, after an examination by a competent court, was require to enter into a recognizance for his appearance before the Circuit Court of that county to answer that charge: that immeiately afterwars Dalsonkille Malay; an that certain eighteen pieces of counterfeit five ollar gol coin, then reay to be prouce to the jury, were the same that ha been pai over by Malay to the two persons before mentione, to whom he owe the ebts respectively. But the Circuit Court refuse to permit any of these facts to be proven to the jury, because, as is state in the bill of exceptions, “ that there was no proof nor offer on the part of the efenant to prove that the gol pieces allege to be counterfeit, were the same pai by Dalson to the ecease.”
It is true, that in this offer to prouce testimony to the jury there was no offer to prouce irect proof to establish the allege fact that the counterfeit gol coin prouce, were the same that were pai over by Dalson to Malay for the pui’chase money of the horse, but there was certainly an offer to prove a chain of facts an circumstances from which, although a conclusion to this effect woul not necessarily follow, it might have been arrive at by the jury within their just province. Even in criminal cases of the highest grae, that kin of circumstantial evience, classe by the elementary writers as uncertain, is amissible. But in such cases, “because of the more serious an irreparable nature of the consequences of a wrong ecision, the jurors are require to be satisfie beyon any reasonable oubt of the guilt of the accuse, or it is their uty to acquit him; the charge not being prove by that higher egree of evience which the law emans. In civil cases it is sufficient if the evience on the whole agrees with an supports the hypothesis which it is auce to prove; but in criminal cases it must exclue every other hypothesis, but that of the guilt of the party. In both cases a verict may be well foune on circumstances alone; an these often lea to a conclusion far more satisfactory than irect evience can prouce. (1 Greenl. Ev., 3 E. sec. 13, p. 74.
The court below therefore erre in refusing to permit proof of the facts, an circumstances offere to be shown in evience. Of their relevancy there coul be no question, as it is clear that where property has been, obtaine from the owner by a felonious act, his unqualifie ownership is not in the least change, an he may peaceably take it, in whose hans soever he may fin it. (Long on Sales, page 166, 7, 8, an cases there cite.

1862710,Arnett vs. Arnett et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1852-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walkee
elivere the opinion of the Court.
The complainant file her bill against the heirs, an the aministrator of the estate of William Arnett, an against Ephraim Myrick an Sherian W. Williams, in which she alleges that she is the wiow of sai intestate, who ie seize an possesse of two slaves, Green an Ey, in whom she claims a ower interest! The heirs an aministrator o not contest the complainant’s right to ower; but Myrick an Williams, who have the slaves in possession, assert title to them as purchasers at juicial sale.
By an agree statement of the facts signe an entere of recor, it is amitte that the slaves were uly levie upon an taken into possession on the first of January, 1849, uner a vali execution against the intestate: that after the levy an before the return ay of the writ, on the 22 January, 1849, the intestate ie: that afterwars, at a regular sheriff’s sale, the efenants, Myrick an Williams, bought an pai for the slaves, an took them into possession. All other facts concee, the question of contest was whether the intestate was so seize an possesse of the slaves at the time of his eath as to entitle the wiow to ower. The court below ecie against her right to ower, an ismisse her bill. An in this she alleges there is error.
The statute, Dig. ch. 59, sec. 20, provies that, “ A wiow shall be entitle, as part of her ower, to one-thir part of the slaves, ■whereof her husban ie seize or possesse, uring her natural life, an one-thir part of the personal estate in her own right.” This section, unlike that which allows ower in real estate, limits the wife’s right to ower to the slaves of which the husban was, at the time of his eath, seize or possesse, an cuts off all claim to ower where the slaves have been ispose of prior to his eath, an this without her co-operation, or assent. The whole question then turns upon the effect of the levy, which, although insufficient to ivest the efenant in execution of title to the property levie upon, for that oes not pass until after sale, 'oes, when mae on personal estate, isseize the efenant an ispossess him of the property levie upon; for whether the officer takes the property into possession or not, it is, in contemplation of law, in his custoy; he is responsible for it, an has a right to hol it against the claims of the efenant in execution, an all others. It is taken in satisfaction of the ebt, an is hel an taken as such until sol, or the levy is otherwise ischarge. The levy, in this case, was not only a isseizin in law, but also in fact, for the property was not only actually taken out of his possession, but beyon the control of the efenant, or his power to reclaim or reuce it to possession by mere force of legal right.
The efenant in execution, therefore, ha not at the time of his eath, such seizin or possession as to entitle the complain ant to ower in the slaves, an consequently there was no error in the ecree of the court below.

elivere the opinion of the court.
This was a proceeing by petition for a manamus to compel the efenant, as sheriff, to acknowlege a ee for certain lans, which the petitioner claims as purchaser at a juicial sale.
The petition is very full, as are also the recitals in the alternative writof manamus. The substance of the groun for manamus, is, that the efenant, as sheriff, offere for sale certain lots of lan, as the property of the Bank : that Johnson, at the instance of the state, an for her benefit, bi off the lan: that the State has been, an is yet reay an willing to pay the sum bi an has tenere the same to the sheriff, who refuse to receive it: that the sheriff well knowing these facts, execute an elivere to Johnson a ee to the State for sai lan: that the sheriff refuses to acknowlege such ee. An prays that he be require to o so, or to show cause why he shoul not be compelle so to o.
The efenant ecline acknowleging the ee,an for cause shows, that the lan was bi off by Johnson, as the attorney for the Bank, an that the petitioner was wholly unknown to him as purchaser: that he applie to Johnson for the sum bi which he refuse to pay; that uner the statute, upon such refusal, it became his uty to re-offer the property for sale, an that he i at the time an place, re-offer sai lan for sale, an sol it to Thomas W. Newton, to whom he execute an acknowlege a ee. Pie positively enies that either Johnson or the State or any one for them, tenere or offere the sum bi, until long after the complete consummation of the secon sale to Newton, but amits a tener by the State after that time. That his eputy took lists of the sales an mae out ees for the purchasers; that he has no recollection of having either signe or elivere a ee for the lan either to Johnson or the State. He is positive that he never intene to o so: that ees were mae out an signe, reay to be elivere when the purchase money was pai. Such ees were usually kept in a box in the clerk’s esk, an may have been taken without his knowlege.
To this response the State mae two replications: first, that the responent i not again offer sai lots for sale, at the time an place at which the first sale was mae: secon, that he i execute such ee to the State for sai lots, an that the same is his act anee. The first of these replications conclues to the country the secon, with a verification. An issues being taken upon them, they were submitte for trial to the court sitting as a jury. After hearing the evience the court foun for the efenant an renere jugment accoringly.
No exception was taken to the opinion of the court on a question of law, except as to the amissibilit}r of a certain eposition. An as there was no motion for a new trial, the correctness of the ecision of the court in excluing such evience presents the only legitimate question to be etermine.
The objection to the eposition, was that the official character of the justice, before whom the same was taken in Kentucky, was not sufficiently authenticate, in this, that what purporte to be the seal of'the Jefferson Circuit Court, was an impression upon paper, without wax or other soft tenacious substance. The court hel this objection goo an exclue the eposition. In this the court erre. In the absence of evience to the contrary, the court shoul have presume in favor of the regularity of the proceeing from the sister State. There may have been a statute there like our own, eclaring that an impression upon paper shall be a sufficient sealing: an whether this be the case or not, the later ecisions of the courts go to iscourage the objection an hol it frivolous. Pillow vs. Roberts, 13 How. U. S. S. C. Rep. 472. 7 Eng. 822.
But then the question recurs, amitting the epositions to be in other respects, unexceptionable, were they amissible uner the issue forme by the parties?
Waiving the consieration of the question whether a writ of manamus is the appropriate remey in this case, which we think extremely oubtful, an conceing the power of the court to compel the officer to perform a legal uty, still the court woul not exercise such power until a clear legal uty was shown, an it was mae to appear that the officer ha faile or refuse to perform it.
In this case the sheriff is calle upon to acknowlege a ee, which purports to have been execute by him as such to the petitioner. It is concee that the bi was mae by Johnson, an it is not shown that the sheriff was aware that the State ha any interest in the bi uuless after the secon sale of the property; but so far from this, the sheriff, in his answer uner oath, positively e nies all knowlege of the fact until after the secon sale: An this answer must be taken as true, because it is not questione by replication, nor is it isproven by other evience. The sheriff thus is cut off from all knowlege of the acts of the State. He coul not request her to pay, because she was unknown to him; an for the same reason an ability or reainess to pay by the Bank, not having been brought home to the sheriff, amounte to nothing. Thus left with Johnson, as the only known bier, who refuse to pay the sum bi, the sheriff, in obeience to the statute, re-offere the property, an sol it to a secon bier, who pai the sum bi to the sheriff. This secon sale was a revocation, uner authority of the statute, of the first bi; an no act of Johnson’s after that time coul restore him to the rights which he ha lost by refusing to pay the sum bi when calle upon.
The first replication is intene to put in issue the time when the secon sale took place. This we have hel, if true, a mere erroneous exercise of power which i not affect the valiity of the sale. Newton vs. State Bank.
An concee that the State i tener the money bi by Johnson, an claim the benefit of his bi, after the resale of the property, this coul not coaler a right on her to eman a ee for the property; because the bi uner which she claime was abanone by the refusal of the only known bier to pay the sum bi, an because the secon bier ha succeee to all his rights.
The ee subsequently foun in the possession of Johnson, bears ate eight ays after the secon sale of the property, an, if the contents of the ee are to be receive as evience, it must be taken all together, an woul show prima facie a ee signe an elivere to Johnson at that ate. If so, it was an act not warrante by law, an of course woul not be consummate by acknowlegment, by the sanction of a court. Uner the circumstances of the case, after the sale to Newton, the first bier stoo in no better situation than any one else; his bi was forfeite; there was no bi; a mere stranger ha as much right to eman a ee as he ha. But the sheriff positively enies the execution of the ee, an there is no proof of its execution except that arising from presumption: but if there was proof upon this point, it woul not avail.
It is not true, as the counsel for the State seem to suppose that the sheriff may charge himself with the sum bi an ispense with the payment of the money. This question was iscusse at length in the case of Dickson vs. Gillilan, 1 Cow Rep. 498. In that case the sheriff receive a large amount of the money an mae a ee to the junior lien creitor uner the New York statute. The first purchaser, at the expiration of the time allowe him to reeem, claime a ee, an it was orere to be mae to him, upon the groun that the sheriff ha no right to make the ee until the whole of the purchase money was pai. The policy of the law forbis that sheriffs shoul be permitte to substitute themselves as ebtors to the creitor. But even if this was permitte, it is evient that no court woul compel the sheriff to o so. Nor will the reainess of the State to pay authorize a ee after the secon sale, because the sheriff has exhauste his power an authority by a sale, an the receipt of the purchase money uner it.'
Returning theivto. the only question of law raise by the assignment of errors, the amissibility of the eposition as evience, limite in its application to the issues forme upon the replication, to the return of the sheriff on the writ of manamus, we are of opinion that ha it been amitte an ha proven every fact put in issue by the replications, that still upon the whole case, the ecision of the court was right, because the execution of the ee shoul have been before the sale to Newton an upon payment of'the money.
Let the jugment of the Puluski Circuit Court be in all things affirme.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of ejectment, brought by Newton'against the Bank, for the recovery of certain lots of lan in the city of Little Rock.
Newton claime title to the lots as a purchaser at sheriff’s sale, an at the trial of the case prouce a recor showing a jugment against the Bank, an execution uly returne, showing a regular levy on the lots, their avertisement an sale accoring to law, an also, the sheriff’s ee, uly acknowlege an recore.
The Bank (the efenant in execution) then offere to prove by parol evience that the sale to the plaintiff was mae without notice, on a ay subsequent to that state in the sheriff’s return; to the introuction of which the plaintiff objecte, upon the grounhat such evience-was inamissible to contraict the return of the sheriff, an the recitals in the ee in that particular. But the Circuit Court overrule the objection, an permitte such evience to be given to the jury; to which the plaintiff excepte. An the amission of this evience over the objection of the plaintiff, presents the only important question to be etermine.
The act of the Legislature, which requires the sheriff to recite the names of the parties, the ate of the writ an of the jugment, together with a escription of the time, place,, an manner of the sale; an which makes such recitals evience of the facts so recite, was intene by the Legislature to supersee the necessity for proucing the recor, from which such recitals were mae, as a matter of convenience, an to furnish evience of the authority uner which the officer acte, as well as the manner in which he ha execute his authority in the ee itself. Not that the recitals shoul be conclusive evience of the facts recite; for that woul exclue all inquiry into the authority uner which the sheriff acte; but that it shoul be legal, competent evience, until falsifie by evience of a higher an more authentic character. The acts of an- officer one in obeience to the law, when require to be certifie an returne, form a part of the recors of the case in which they are ha; Lawson v. Main, 4 Ark. 186; an being part of the recors, the return, as well as the execution an the jugment, imports absolute verity, an is alike conclusive as the jugment, upon the rights of the parties to the recor. It is upon this principle that this court, in the case of Jamison v. May, 6 Eng. 374, hel parol evience inamissible to contraict a sheriff’s return upon a writ of summons. An this ecision of ours is fully sustaine by numerous authorities, an ajuge cases, in several of which the question arose uner circumstances strikingly similar to the case before us. Thus, in the case of Love & Williams v. Powell, 5 Ala. 58; in a suit to try title, where the plaintiff claime uner a sheriff’s ee, the court hel parol evience inamissible to contraict the sheriff’s return, an in conclusion the court sai, “ Our conviction is that the ee is conclusive an cannot be impeache on a collateral issue, except for frau in the execution of the ee, when*the process uner which the lan was sol is supporte by an existing unsatisfie jugment.”
In the case of Jackson vs. Roberts, 7 Wen. 86, the sheriff’s ee escribe the sale as having been mae uner execution in favor of Hill & Stubbins. The efenant sought to isprove the truth of this recital bypai’ol evience. The court sai, the question is “Can that part of the sheriff’s ee be contraicte by parol evience, which sets forth the writ uner which the sale was mae ?” The court then refers to, an approves its former ecisions in the cases of Jackson vs. Vanenhayen, 17, John. 167, an Jackson vs. Croy, 12 John. R. 427, in which parol evience was hel inamissible to contraict a sheriff’s ee, an after commenting upon the effects of a ifferent rule, the court conclue its opinion with the following remarks : “We see no formiable mischief likely to result from the operation0of such a principle. A party who may be injure by the mistake of a sheriff can have relief by a summary application to the courts uner whose authority the sheriff acts, or through the meium of a court of equity ; an it is much better that he shoul be confine to this moe of reress, than to rener all titles erive uner juicial sales oubtful, an subject to be efeate by allowing the written instruments, by which they are evience, to be attacke collaterally by parol evience.”
Chief Justice Sharkey says, in Minor vs. Select Men of Natchez, 4. S & Mar. 619. “The purchaser is not put upon enquiry as to the regularity of the jugment. In the official character of the sheriff an his general power erive from that character, purchasers have a guaranty that they will be protecte in their title.” Savage Ch. J., in the case of Jackson vs. Calwell, 1 Cow. Rep. 644, sai, “It may therefore be consiere as settle law, that a bona fie purchaser at a sheriff’s sale acquires a vali title as against the efenant in the execution, unless it is not only voiable but absolutely voi.”
The case of Trigg vs. Lewis, 3 Littell 131, lays own the general rule, an shows that it is peculiarly applicable to sheriff’s returns. The court says, “ It is a general rule that the acts of a ministerial officer, as far as the rights of the parties affecte thereby are concerne, must be taken as true, when brought into contest collaterally, an can only be impeache by a irect proceeing, such as makes the officer a party. This rule is peculiarly applicable to returns of sheriffs on process. Hence this court ecie in the case of Hornback vs. Smith, that the return of a sheriff on the writ of habere facias possessionem is conclusive. It is therefore clear that it was not competent for the efenant to aver an prove any thing against the return of the officer in this instance; such as the proof tenere by the replication, that the lan was not in fact sol, an that the proceeings relative thereto were not real.”
The ecisions are irectly in point, an may be consiere as conclusively settling the questions; First, that the return of the sheriff must be consiere an treate as part of the recors in the case; an seconly, that parol evience is inamissible to contraict it. The oor for re-investigation is close upon the parties to the recor. It is not to be questione by them; an this because they are parties to the recor, an have ay in court; an it is not only their interest but their uty to look to the regularity of the proceeings, an when passe without objection they may be sai in effect, to have receive the approval of the parties. An so with regar to the execution of final process. It is execute for their benefit by the officer of the law, an uring the whole time up to the sale an acknowlegment of the ee, they have ay in court, an it is their uty to see that the sale is conucte fairly; at least, if they shoul fail to o so, they have but little cause for complaint. The purchaser, a stranger, who ha no agency in proucing the irregularity, an no power to control or irect the action of the officer in any respect, who has bought in goo faith, an acquire a legal title, vali an regular upon the face of his ee, shoul be protecte in that title against those parties to the recor, who have stoo by an-without objection, suffere him to pay the purchase money, the benefit of which they receive, an receive a ee, sanctione an approve by the court without objection from,them. Uner such circumstances, as between the purchaser an the parties to the recor, it woul be wrong to suffer them, in a collateral proceeing, to introuce parol evience to contraict the recor evience of the purchaser’s title.
This question has been substantially settle by the ecision of this court in the case of The State Bank vs. Nolan an others; ecie at the last term of this court, where it is hel that after the purchaser has acquire title by sheriff’s ee approve an orere to be recore, at no subsequent time, after the lapse of that term, shall his title be questione for frau, accient, or mistake, or for any irregularity in the proceeings, which must as of necessity (in most instances) arise out of one or other of these causes, upon motion, or in a proceeing at common law. But where the proceeings were such as, in the first instance, to vest in him a legal title to the estate therein conveye, or, in the language of the court, when elivering its opinion in that case, “ When his legal title is perfect, an when the valiity of the title itself is assaile for frau, accient or mistake, arising out of the irregularity of the proceeings, or the acts of the parties, he has a right to be hear before a tribunal that can rightfully exercise jurisiction in such matters, with power an process to bring all the parties in interest before it, to put them upon their consciences to answer; to cancel the ee; to restore possession ; an to awar equitable compensation.”
How far, or uner what circumstances the return of the sheriff an the recitals in the ee may be questione in a irect proceeing in chancery, for that purpose, or where frau is allege in the execution of the ee, we are not now calle upon to ecie; because, in the case before us, no offer was mae to introuce evience to prove frau. It is true that proof that the sale was mae after the ay fixe by law, an without notice, might, when taken in connection with other evience, conuce to prove frau. An if the efenant ha propose this in connection with other evience, for that purpose, the question woul have arisen as to its amissibility in a common law court- upon a collateral issue. But the avowe object of the efenant was to falsify an isprove the return of the sheriff, as to the time of the sale an the notice given. This, we have sai, coul not be one. An upon examination of the authorities cite by counsel, in which parol evience was amitte to isprove the return of the officer, it will be foun that in Tennessee such evience was allowe to prove a want of notice, because the statute of that State eclare the sale voi, without notice. An so also in Kentucky, as to the quantity of lan to be sol. The statute forbi the sale of more lan than woul pay the ebt. This was a violation of a prohibitory, not a irectory statute. In the case in 5 Blackf. 260, the strongest, case referre to by counsel, the evience was amitte to prove a frau. An none of them are applicable to the state of case before us. , The counsel has, in an ingenious argument, eneavore to bring them to bear upon this case, by assuming that if the sale shoul be proven to be on a ay subsequent to the first ay of the return term, it woul be voi, because the execution was not then in force, an conferre no power on the sheriff to sell, an that parol evience was amissible to prove the sale voi, as hel in Tennessee, Kentucky an Iniana. This groun- was, we apprehen, taken uner a misapprehension of the statute. It is true that the statute irects the sale to be mae on the first ay of the return term, but makes the writ returnablé on the secon ay of the term, Dig. Ch. 67, sec. 9; anthis, as appears from the efenant’s own evience, was theay on which the sale was in fact mae, although returne by the sheriff as mae on the first ay of the term. A sale mae on the return ay of the writ is vali. Blaisall vs. Sheife, 5 New. 11, 201. Tayloe vs. Gaskins, 1 Dev. 295.
The sale then was not voi for want of power in the sheriff to sell, an as regars the irregularity in selling on a ay ifferent from that irecting sheriff’s sales an without notice, these are irregularities which arise in the exercise of power conferre. A eparture by the officer from the statutory irections, as to the manner of executing his power, oes not affect the title of a bona fie purchaser at sheriff’s sale. This has been so repeately ecie by this court that it may now be hel as settle law. Aamson et al. vs. Cummins a. 5 Eng. 541. Byers & McDonal, vs. Fowler,et al. 7 Eng. 218. Whiting & Slark, vs. Beebe, et al. 7 Eng. 421.
But even if a oubt coul arise as to the correctness of these ecisions in orinary cases, it is very questionable whether this case woul come uner the rule as lai own by the authorities most favorable to the efenant’s case; for the statute in regar to sales mae after the property has been regularly avertise an bi off, an where the purchaser refuses to pay the sum bi, irects a re-sale, but is silent both as to the time an manner of sale. No oubt the officer may, on the same ay, re-offer the property for sale, an then there woul be no necessity for notice, but suppose, as is no oubt the case in most instances, in counties where there is much litigation, that the sheriff shoul not fin time after selling, to hunt up the purchaser an make his settlement with him, or upon a refusal of the purchaser to pay the sum bi, to re-sell the property at once. It is evient that in many instances a large number of sales woul be postpone by sham bis, procure to be mae by irresponsible biers, an if the sheriff is not allowe to sell the property on another ay, it woul result in incalculable elay an mischief. When, however, he comes to fix the ay, the law is silent both as to time, place an notice. Shoul he refer to the statute he coul erive no ai from it as a preceent, for it was certainly not intene to wait until the first ay of the next succeeing term ; nor as regars notice, that thirty ays shoul be allowe ; but on the contrary of this the statute is silent, an by its other provisions seems to contemplate a summary sale, by which, however, the efenant an the plaintiff are both protecte against ultimate loss, by holing the first bier responsible over for any loss which may arise, in case the property shoul not sell for as much at the secon as it i at the first sale. Thus the first purchaser is mae to stan between the efenant an loss occasione by his refusal to pay the price for which the property sol at the appointe time by law an upon regular notice.
In the case uner consieration the efenant, by her attorney, was the first bier, to whom the property was struck off, at a sale amitte to be in all respects regular. Upon a refusal of the attorney to pay the sum bi, the property, as appears by the sheriff’s return, was thereupon at once re-sól, an as the efenant contens, it was sol the next ay after. The secon sale then was the result of the act of the efenant, who became, uner the statute, responsible for any loss that might accrue by reason of the secon sale. If loss, then ha accrue, it woul have been his own fault, an upon his own responsibility. Bnt in truth no loss in this instance accrue; for the property sol for as much at the secon, as it i at the first sale, an consequently no injury resulte from the secon sale.
If the officer, uninfluence by the conuct of the purchaser, ha abuse his official power to the prejuice of the rights of the Bank, he is responsible to her for amages, or if, by the combine action of the officer an the purchaser a frau has been perpetrate to the inj ury of the Bank, she must apply to a court competent to affor relief; but in a common law court the valiity of a sheriff’s ee cannot be questione by parol evience touching irregularities, not affecting the power an authority in the officer to sell an execute such ee.
There is no oubt but that the Circuit Court erre in permitting parol evience to be given to the jury to contraict the return of the sheriff an the recitals in the ee. An for this error the jugment of the Pulaski Circuit Court must be set asie an reverse, an the cause remane for further proceeings to be ha accoring to law, an not inconsistent with this opinion.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The appellant was inicte, trie, convicte an sentence to eath in the Inepenence Circuit Court for the murer of Hiram Payne, a white man. He appeale to this court, an his senténcé having been respite by the Circuit Court, uner the provisions of the statute, a sufficient time to allow him to make an application to a juge of this court for a suspension of his execution until his appeal coul be hear here, that orer was mae upon an inspection of a transcript of the recor an proceeings in accorance with his prayer.
From the bills of exceptions it appears that, on the ay before the killing, the appellant an his master, Benjamin Watson,ha a conversation, in which the slave talke improperly to his master,' an that at night when he returne from ploughing, he brought, a club in with him. That after supper he sat out upon the yar fence with the same in his han, an also picke up another stick, which he took to his quarters an set up at the oor, carrying the first name stick into the house. That in the course of the evening, an after supper, his master went into a room where the-school boys an hirelings were, whereupon the appellant left his own room an went to the chimney corner of the welling house. That about the mile of the night the appellant walke out into the yar carrying a fire torch, an the stick that he ha brought from the fiel, in his han. Upon returning to his quarters he tol his wife they were going to take him, but that he woul not be taken by bis master or any boy else, an that he woul knock the first man own that came into the room. ■ The next morning, the appellant went to mill an returne, an then bunle up his clothes an took them away. He then got some tubs, as he was orere to o, an went to the Woos for some hoop poles, as he was orere to o by a witness, who was oing some work for Watson, the master, an neee the hoop poles for the work in progress. It woul seem thats about this perio of time, Mrs. Watson, the wife of the master, ha sent a message to her husban, who was at the school house, to the effect that the appellant ha run away, an it appearing that while Watson, the master, was on the way from the school house to his welling, whither he was going in consequence of receiving such a message from his wife, he met the appellant coming from the woos with some hoop poles an an axe in his hans. It appears that then “Watson an others avance towars the (appellant) at the request of Watson, an for the purpose, as expresse by Mr. Watson of correcting” him. Who these others were an how they happene to be with Watson oes not appear. It appears, however, that when Watson an these others approache to the appellant, that he retreate, but that they overlook him in the roa an orere him to lay own his axe, an he refuse, an sai that he woul not be w’hippe by Watson, or any boy else, an that he woul kill the first man that attempte to take him, an that he then walke on, an Watson an the men after him. In a short time he stoppe again an was conversing with Watson, but what was sai oes not appear. At this point of time “Hiram Payne, the slain, walke rapily by the witness, from behin the witness, being behin the boy an the company, having in his hans a piece of pine plank. That Payne, the ecease, walke irectly up to Watson an Austin, the appellant, an rew his stick upon Austin. That Austin stoo with his axe rawn as Payne rew his stick upon Austin. That Austin ware off the blow of Payne with his left arm, an with his right struck Payne with the axe. That Payne was hit with the whole ege of the axe on his hea, the cut penetrating to the brain, an that Payne ie the Saturay afterwars.”
Upon the trial so much of the evience was objecte to as relate to matters that transpire the ay before the homipie, upon the groun of its isconnection with that principal fact, an irreleyan cy to the issue. It is certainly true as a general rule, both in civil an criminal cases, that the evience must be confine to the point in issue; an in criminal cases there is perhaps a greater necessity, if possible, than in civil proceeings to enforce the rule: but in neither class of cases oes this rule exclue all evience that oes not bear irectly upon the issue; on the contrary, all evience is amissible which tens to prove it, an no facts are forbien to be shown, except such as are incapable of afforing any reasonable presumption or inference in eluciation of the matters involve in the issue. In this case the line of efence taken, an which the State ha the right to anticipate, was that the homicie amounte to no more than manslaughter. The presen ce or absence of malice was therefore an essential matter of enquiry. To establish it the State was not boun to rely exclusively upon the malice that the law presumes from the killing, an the eviences of it which were otherwise shown by the circuriistances at the point of time when the killing occurre, but ha the right to a any other evience, as former gruges, former threats, previous lying in wait, cumulative of the former, an • thus effectually to repel any inferences that might be rawn in favor of the efence from the circumstances that transpire at the time of the killing. In like manner, anteceent facts an circumstances, from which any reasonable presumption coul arise, or inference be rawn, that the course of conuct pursue by the prisoner at the time of the killing ha been previously premeitate an resolve upon by him, in reference to a probable effort to bring him back into perfect suborination to the lawful authority of his master, although without any reference to the particular iniviual slain, tene at once, not only to eluciate the intention of the slave at the’time of striking the fatal blow, but the state an conition of his heart, both as to evil esign in general, an in being resolve, in pursuance of the ictates of such wicke, eprave an malignant evil esign in general, to o the particular, unlawful act of resisting the rightful authority of his master at all hazars, incluing that of taking human life in general, regarless of social uty an without respect to persons.
Such a resolye, prompte by the ictates of such a heart, coul not be otherwise, than essentially malicious, an if in being acte out, human life was taken, although uner circumstances which, isconnecte with such resolve, might lay grouns for presumptions that the slayer was actuate by a esign to save his own life, or was prompte by circumstances transpiring at the time strongly calculate to excite the passions of terror an resentment, it coul not be otherwise than a legitimate point of enquiry by the jury, whether or not the homicie ha been really superinuce by the former, although apparently by the latter, to the en that the presumption in favor of manslaughter might be legitimately overslaughe by these cumulative presumptions of malice.
. It is in this point of view that we think the jury in this case ha the right to consier an weigh the evience objecte to. They ivere sitting in jugment upon an act which, in point of law, was to be essentially characterize by the motive of the heart which prompte it. These in the orer of Provience are hien an beyon the reach of human law, until evelope by acts of commission, or of omission, which present them to its jugment in etermining the quality of the act brought in question. Every act then of either class, which in the range of probability coul cast a ray of light upon the motive, which prouce the homicie in question, was legitimately within the range of the investigation, although occurring at an anteceent time, or at another place unless forbien by the rule esigne to confine the investigation to the issue mae; an this rule, as we have seen, oes not exclue any evience that tens to prove or eluciate any of the matters involve in the issue. An regaring the evience objecte to in this case as of that character, we think the court below properly allowe it to go to the jury.
The secon bill of exceptions raises the question, whether or not the confessions of the accuse, being otherwise unexceptionable in point of law, can be allowe to be prouce in evience after the facts themselves have been proven by witnesses who were present when they transpire. We think it perfectly clear that they may, being both of the same grae of evience, although iffering in the weight to be given to them by the jury.
In the thir, it is amitte that it was shown that the confessions were obtaine without the prisoner having been promise or threatene in any way, an that there was no inucement ,or reason hel out to him to- answer the question propoune by one of his guars “what he ha against the ecease to inuce him to strike him,” or otherwise to talk upon the subject. But it is insiste, as the confessions were so mae in response to that question, which it is urge implie the guilty act of the prisoner, an was mae to one of his guar at a time when he was in chains an being brought to jail upon the charge in question, that they ought to have been exclue from the jury. In Mr. Greenleaf’s work on evience the law upon this subject is thus state: “Though it is necessary to the amissibility of a confession that it shoul have been voluntarily mae, that is, that it shoul have been mae, as before shown, without the appliances of hope or fear from persons having authority, yet it is not necessary that it shoul have been the prisoner’s own spontaneous act. It will be receivable though it were inuce by spiritual exhortations, whether of a clergyman or any other person; by solemn promise of secrecy, even confirme by an- oath, or by reason of the prisoner’s having been runk, or by some collateral benefit or boon-, no hope or favor having been hel out in respect to the criminal charge against him, or by any eception practice on the prisoner or false representation mae to him for that purpose, provie there is no reason to suppose that the inucement hel out was calculate to prouce any untrue confession, which is the main point to be consiere. So, a confession is amissible though it is elicite by questions, whether put to a prisoner by a magistrate, officer or private person, an the form of the question is immaterial to the amissibility, even though it assumes the prisoner’s guilt, In all these cases the evience may be lai before the jury, however little it may weigh uner the circumstances, an however reprehensible may be the moe in which, in some of them, it was obtaine.” (1 Greenl. Ev. part 2, ch. 12, sec. 229, p. 293, 5 eition.)
Although in some few of the cases state in this text, we woul look closely to the authorities, upon which they are base, before eclaring the law to the full extent that they are state to go, we can have no hesitancy, on the question before us now, in holing that the objection taken was not goo.
The fourth bill of exceptions presents a question of practice in this wise. The name of Benjamin Watson, the master of the prisoner, was enorse upon the inictment as a witness; he was summone as such for the State, was in attenance upon the trial, an with the other State’s witnesses was sworn in chief, but he was not interrogate or put upon the stan by the State as a witness. The prisoner claime the right to cross-examine him upon the whole case, an relie upon the English practice. The court overrule his motion. Upon an examination of the authorities, we think that the ecie preponerance in the American courts, is in favor of confining the right of cross-examination to those facts an circumstances only, connecte with the matters actually state in the irect examination of a witness; an that if the cross-examining party wishes to examine the witness as to other matters, he must o so by making the witness his own-, an calling him as such in the subsequent progress of the case (1 Greenl. Ev. part 3, ch. 3, sec. 445, p. 562.)
The fifth bill of exceptions presents the question whether the owner of a slave is a competent witness in a prosecution involving the life of the slave. In this case he was offere as a witness on the part of the prisoner; the State objecte because of his pecuniary interest as owner, an the court sustaine the objection. This question first was iscusse in North Carolina, in a case where a master refuse to testify against his slave, an on error his appeal was sustaine, but the court, in the iscussion lai great stress upon the fact of general incompetency,-because of the law of that State, which mae the master substantially a party to the recor, by reason of the provision for a jugment of ¡costs against him upon the conviction of his slave. (State vs. Charity, 2 Dev. Rep. 543). In that case, however, Chief Justice Henerson elivere a separate opinion from the majority of the court, an foreshaowe the principles which have since been recognize an aopte in some of the other slave States. He sai, “ My concurrence in the opinion of the court, in excluing the master on the groun of interest, is so feeble that it almost amounts to a issent. Where pecuniary interest only is at stake, to exclue a witness on the score of interest, however small, is applying a scale of morality to our nature sufficiently humiliating. But when the life or eath of a fellow being is to be the result of the trial, to exclue a witness because he may have a pecuniary interest, either in preserving or taking the life of the accuse, is attributing to us, frail as we know ourselves to be, more epravity than we are willing, I think, to amit. The rule, as lai own by the court, as I unerstan it, exclues the master on the same groun, that of interest, in becoming a witness for his slave; for the rule must be mutual. If he cannot be compelle to give evience against his slave, because of his interest, he cannot, even if he is willing, give evience for him on the same groun. I shoul rather suppose that the interest at stake, being so entirely ifferent from that which is orinarily brought forwar to protect a witness from giving evience, orto exclue him> if willing, that it is not to be weighe in the same balances with mere pecuniary interest. It is so transcenant in its nature that its weight is not to be ascertaine by mere money balances.”
The same question afterwars arose in Tennessee, in a case where, like in this before us, the master’s evience ha been rejecte by the Circuit Court, on the groun of interest. The court reverse the jugment for that error, an in elivering its opinion, by Reese, J., sai: “ But it is sai the Circuit Court erre in rejecting the master of the slave when offere as a witness in his favor, on the groun of his incompetency from pecuniary interest. An of this opinion are the court. A father has an interest, which may be valuable, in the services of his minor son, yet it is not questione that he can be a witness for or against him on a charge affecting his life. A master may have a pecuniary interest in the future labor an services of his apprentice, much exceeing, it may be in a few pursuits, the entire value of his slave: yet perhaps it has never occurre to any one that the master is incompetent to testify on behalf of the apprentice in a matter affecting his life. The relation of master an slave is inee ifferent; but in a case like this, the law, upon high grouns of public policy, pretermits for a moment that relation, takes the slave out of the hans of his master, forgets his claims an rights of property,” — as in the case, the juge might have ae, where the trespass for killing a slave is merge into the felony, an prohibits the recovery of the money value of the slave until the slayer has been first trie uner an inictment for the felony. (3 Porter Ala. Rep. 424)—“treats the slave as a rational an intelligent human being, responsible to moral, social an municipal uties an obligations an gives him the benefit of all the forms of trial which jealousy of power an love of liberty have inuce a freeman to throw aroun himself for his own protection. If thep the master knows any fact tening to save the life of the slave, shall society, who have taken from him the slave for the purpose of trial, say to him, not that you are master, an we will weigh your creit, but you are master an shall not speak at all! On grouns of public policy, of common humanity, of absolute necessity, the master must be hel to be competent as a witness for or against the slave. Society will not allow him to say, I have a pecuniary interest in the event of the trial, my testimony may subject me to a loss, an I will not testify against my slave. On the other han, humanity forbis that society shoul say, you have such an interest an shall not be hear to prove a fact in his favor. In cases where one slave may kill another, the master may often be the only person cognizant of his guilt, or the only person who can establish his innocence. Shall he refuse to speak in the one case, lest he incur a loss? Shall his lips be seale in the other, because he has an interest? Public policy an common humanity eclare the necessity of so treating this relation that the guilty shoul not escape punishment, or the ipnocent be mae to suffer.” (Elijah vs. The State, 1 Humph. R. 102.)
Afterwars, in the year 1841, a case raising the same question was brought before the High Court of Errors an Appeals in Mississippi. That also was a case where the master of the slave was offere as a witness for him in the Circuit Court, an that court refuse to allow him to testify, on the groun of interest; an for this error the Court of Errors reverse the jugment, an Chief Justice Sharkey, after approving the opinion of the court in Tennessee, which we have cite, as “base upon soun an humane principles” an recognizing the analogy to the case of master an apprentice, on the score of interest, then, in treating the question as one of public policy an common humanity, remarks as follows: “The master has the custoy of his slave an owes to him protection, an it woul be a rigorous rule inee if the master coul not be a witness in behalf of his slave 1 What woul be the conition of the slave, if the rule which bins him to perpetual servitue, shoul also create such an interest in the master as to eprive him of the testimony of that master? The harships of such a rule will illy comport with that humanitjr which shoul be extene to that race of people. In prosecutions for offences, negroes are to be treate as other persons: an although the master may have ha an interest in his servant, yet the servant ha such an interest in the testimony of his master as will outweigh mere pecuniary consierations, nor can he be eprive of the benefit of that testimony by the mere circumstance that in a civil point of view he was regare by the law as property.” Isham vs. The State, 6 How. (Miss.) R. 35.)
Recognizing these principles of law, public policy an common humanity, thus so aptly presente, as clearly soun, we aopt them without hesitancy, as the true exposition of the point of law in question, an therefore think it clear that the Circuit Court erre in refusing to allow Watson, the master, to testify when offere as a witness on the part of his slave, Austin, the appellant; holing that the matter of Watson’s pecuniary interest lay to his creibility only an not to his competency as a witness.
The remaining question relates to so much of the charge of the court as was objecte to an save in the sixth bill of exceptions. That was, “That if the jury shoul fin that the efenant was in rebellion to the authority of his master, Payne ha a right to take the efenant an to use such force as was necessary to take him, an that if the efenant then attacke Payne an slew him, he was guilty of murer, an his offence coul not be reuce to manslaughter, even although the striking of the efenant by Payne woul have been evience to show an extenuation of the killing of Payne by the efenant from murer to manslaughter, if the slave ha not been at fault in acting in rebellion to the authority of his master.”
From the face of this recor we cannot say that this charge is too latituinous an unqualifie, because the bills of exception neither purport to save all the evience prouce on the trial of the cause, nor all to which the charge was applicable, so as- to exclue any presumption in favor of the charge, that other evience in support of it might have been prouce. But without any regar to this consieration, we are free to say, that the tranquility of the public at large, the security of the master, the value of the slave as property, an the just protection an comfort of the slave himself, all epen so essentially upon his entire suborination to the lawful authority of his master, that we woul hesitate long before we woul eclare otherwise than that the principle, lai own in this charge, was any other than a soun general principle of the common law of slavery, as it exists in our slave States. In preserving this lawful suborination, upon which the best interests of the community, of the master, an of the slave, so raically epen, every citizen in common with the master, has an abiing interest. An when a slave is in rebellion to the lawful authority of his master, whatever force may be necessary to bring him within the pale of suborination, grauate upon principles of law an humanity, let it tcome from what quarter it may, invaes no right of the slave, an consequently oes him no such wrong as the law can recognize as a mitigation or excuse for crime. (Jacob vs. The State, 3 Humph. R. 493.)

By an act for the relief of the securities of John Hickey, sheriff of Pope county, approve January 11th, 1851, they were allowe until the first ay of November, thereafter, to pay the amount pf his efalcation as collector of the State an county revenue, for the year 1850, an release from all forfeitures an penalties incurre, provie, they woul give bon with security, to be approve by the county juge, in vacation, for the payment of the same an with interest upon the revenue ue the State. Availing themselves of this act, they execute the bon upon which this suit was brought. The bon is mae payable to the State for the penal sum of $3,933. An, after reciting that the principals ha become security for Ilickey, as collector, that he ha mae efault, &c., that there remaine ue an unpai, from him, on account of State revenue the sum of $1042 75, an for county revenue,the sum of $'925 73, an the act passe for their relief, it was conitione to be voi, if the principals shoul well an truly pay into the State treasury, an into .the county treasury, respectively, the sums above specifie, with interest, on or before the first ay of November thereafter.
No oubt exists as to the liability of these parties, an no useful en woul be attaine by a statement of the efence sought to be interpose by one of them.

Digest, title, Practice at Law, sec. 81.
It is argue for the plaintiff in error, that this proceeing is erroneous, an we are cite to the cases of Phillips vs. The Governor, 2 Ark. 382. Aams vs. The State, 1 Eng. 490. Outlaw vs. The Governor, 3 ib. 353. Nelson vs. Hubbar, ib. 477. an McLain vs. Taylor, 4 ib. 363. In all these cases the bons sue upon were conitione for the performance of some act other than the payment of money, being either upon elivery bons or official l)ons; an tho.ugh we think, that in some of those cases the court, have ahere to the language of the statute, perhaps with unnecessary strictness, for reasons which might be given, yet we are not require now to go into an examination of them.
The statute, Digest, title, Penal Bons, provies for three istinct classes of cases, an the moe of proceeing in each is ifferently regulate. The first four sections relate to actions foune on bons conitione for the payment of a less sum of money. The sections from five to fifteen, apply to suits on bons for the breach of any conition other than for the payment of money. Sections fifteen et seq. regulate the moe of proceeing in suits on official bons ; incluing those of aministrators, guarians, &c. It is only in the last two classes of cases, where the jugment is by efault, or on emurrer, that a jury must be calle, unless waive, to enquire into the truth of the breaches assigne, an assess the amages, an when, as ecie by the cases referre to, such shoul be the form of the oath aministere to the jury, in compliance with the statute. But upon the reaing of the statute those provisions have no application to actions on bons, conitione for the payment of a less sum, an where the amount ue is ascertaine, or ascertainable by computation from the face of the instrument itself, as is the case here. In all such cases the penalty is inserte rather as an aherence to ancient form, an not because it is an essential part of the contract; an while no goo reason can be imagine for the intervention of a jury to assess the amages, the statute is not so unreasonable as to require it.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The efenant was inicte in the Yan Burén Circuit Court for an assault an battery, allege to have been committe on the person of one William York. At the foot of the inictment there ■is the following enorsement: “ This inictment is preferre upon the testimony of the party injure, who was summone on presentation an by orer of the gran jury.
JOHN H. BYERS, Pro. Atto.”
The question is, was this enorsement sufficient uner the 87th sec. Dig. ch. 52. That section provies that “ No inictment for any trespass on the person or property of another, not amounting to felony, shall be preferre, unless the name of the prosequtor be enorse thereon, except where the same is preferre on the information or knowlege of one or more of the gran jury, or on the information of some public officer in the necessary ischarge of his uty, or on the' testimony of some witness other than the party injure, in which case a statement of the fact shall be mae at the en of the inictment an signe by the attorney for the State.”
The enorsement in this case falls short of a compliance with the statute. The fact that the witness was summone to testify, was not sufficient to supersee the necessity of his enorsement as prosecutor. If the party assaulte was permitte thus to evae the statute, he woul rarely incur the responsibility of paying the costs of the prosecution, in the event of an acquittal, by enorsing himself as prosecutor, when by procuring himself to be summone, he coul by his testimony put on foot a prosecution intene to gratify his private resentment without incurring such responsibility.
It may sometimes be the case that the party injure is the only witness by whom the offence can be proven, an that, because of his refusal to become prosecutor, the offener may go unpunishe; but we apprehen that cases of this kin will be rare. The language of the enorsement is somewhat peculiar; it is that “the inictment is foun on .the testimony of the party injure, who was summone upon presentation, an by orer of the gran jury.” This language strongly implies that the gran jury were informe, or ha knowlege of the fact, an upon such information summone the witness. If such was the fact an their information was sufficient to satisfy them, that an inictment shoulabe preferre, the enorsement woul have been sufficient, if it ha simply state the fact that it was foun upon the information of one or more of the gran jurors. But in the case before us, it is expressly state that the inictment is foun upon the testimony of the party injure, an the resiue of the enorsement is intene to show how an uner what circumstances he was brought before the gran jury. The enorsement was clearly insufficient, an the motion to quash properly sustaine.

This suit was institute by attachment, in the Ranolph Circuit Court. The writ was irecte to the constable of Demeen Township, in Ranolph county, to be by him execute an returne. At the return term the plaintiff move to have the writ amene, so as to show accoring to the facts, that the reason why it was so irecte, was that the offices both of sheriff an' coroner of that county, were vacant at the time of its issuance; an at the same time, upon the groun of the omission of any such reason, the efenant move to quash the writ. The court overrule the motion to amen, an sustaine .the motion to quash.
The act of December 21st, 1846, provies that where the offices of sheriff an coroner of any county are both vacant, an so where there is no coroner, an the sheriff is intereste in the suit, it shall be the uty of any constable of the county, to whom process may be irecte, to execute an return it in the same manner as sheriffs an coroners are require by law to o.
This statute was esigne to facilitate the remey, by substituting another class of executive officers in the place of the sheriff or coroner, whose appropriate uty it is to execute process of the Circuit Courts, in particular cases when those offices are vacant, or the officers themselves are isqualifie; seeing that such vacancies or contingencies may happen, against which the laws cannot provie. The statute is not objectionable as tening to ispense with the office of sheriff or coroner, which the legislature coul not o, but is rather to be commene as an effort on the part of the legislature to guar against any possible failure of justice, for want of the means appointe by law to attain that en.
On the other han, the averse party to be affecte by process issuing from the Circuit Court in civil cases, has the right to insist that such process shall be execute by its proper officer; because he is presume to be a man of substance, personally responsible for his tortious acts, is uner the immeiate control of the court, an whose official bon, in cases where the securities are liable for his acts of commission or omission, furnishes ample inemnity against any abuse of the powers confie to him. An as the authority of the constable to act in the stea of the sheriff, is a special one an limite to the particular case, resting solely on the groun that there is no sheriff or coroner in commission, or none qualifie to act, the fact of such vacancy, or isqualification ought to be suggeste an recite in the writ, which then becomes the officer’s warrant, an a notification to the efenant of his authorityJ;o execute it; an it may well be pleae in abatement of the process that such suggestion or recital is untrue in fact.
But the omission of such recital oes not make voi the writ, which is, in legal contemplation, issue out of the court, presume to know who are its officers; an whenever the power to issue such special process is concee, no goo reason is perceive why it oes not come within the beneficial operation of the statute of amenments. We cannot suppose that the allowance of the amenment, propose to be mae in this case, accoring to the truth of the matter, coul operate to the surprise or injury of the efenant, or eprive him of any substantial right affecting the merits of the suit. On the contrary, its allowance woul conuce to the furtherance of justice. It is fair to presume that if the efenant is injure, it is by the want of authority in the constable to act, an not by means of the omission of the evience of that authority. Accoring to the opinion in Mitchell vs. Conley, at January term, 1853, we conclue that the iscretion of the court in refusing to allow the amenment was not rightly exercise, an for that reason the jugment ought to be reverse, an the cause remane for further proceeings, accoring to law an not inconsistent with this opinion.",legal_case,positive

elivere the opinion Of the Court-.
This is a suit in chancery, brought in the. Crawfor Circuit Court for the purpose of having correcte a mistake in the escription of certain lans to which the complainant sets up title. The substance of the complaint is, that John Dillar, who resie in the county of Crawfor, was the legal owner of several quarter an fractional quarter sections of lan; composing one tract of about 937 acres, on which he ha a farm an resie with his family in the year 1841, an continue there to resie until his eath. On the 14th ay of September of that year, jugment was renere against him in the Crawfor Circuit Court, in favor of Thomas E. an Heiro T. Wilson, for $3,800, upon which execution issue on the 3 of August, 1842, which at the instance of Dillar, was levie upon the tract of lan oil which he so resie, but that the sheriff, in recoring his levy upon the writ, misescribe several of the tracts of lan levie upon, by recoring other tracts, not the property of Dillar, instea of those actually levie upon; that afterwars, at the instance of Dillar, his lans were appraise, an because no one woul bi two-thirs of their value, they were returne not sol. On the 30th August, 1843, an alias fi. fa. issue, on the back of which was enorse the former levy, an that uner this writ the sheriff avertise an sol the lan on the 25th of September, "" 1843, at public sale, to George W. Paschal for $500, to whom he execute' a ee for the same. That the same mistake committe in recoring the return- of the levy upon the original writ was continue in the after proceeings incluing the avertisements of the lan, an the ee to Paschal; but that the actual levy an sale were of Dillar’s lan.
It appears that Dillar was in embarrasse circumstances, an that several other jugments ha been renere in sai court against him, all of which as well as that of the Wilsons’ were uner the control of Paschal for collection. That at the instance of Dillar, it was agree between himself an Paschal, that Paschal shoul buy the property, then recognize by Dillar as his homestea place, an give him (Dillar) twelve months to reeem the same by paying Wilson’s jugment, an part of one of the other jugments uner Paschal’s control as collector. That Dillar ie without having reeeme the property, an that Paschal afterwars, on the 14th ay of September, 1849, conveye the lan to Joseph H. Bailey, by quit claim ee, for $3,000, an that Bailey on the same ay sol itto complainant for $1,000, payable in twelve months, an took from complainant a bon lor the payment of the purchase money, an execute to him a covenant, by which he boun himself to convey to complainant the lan upon the payment of the bon for $1,000. That both Paschal an Bailey in goo faith sol, an intene to convey the Dillar homestea place, but were le into a mistake in the escription of the lan by following that in the sheriff’s ee. Soon after the purchase óf complainant the mistake was iscovere, to correct which this suit is brought.
The plaintiff in execution, the aministrator an heirs of Dillar, Paschal an Bailey are mae efenants, an with the exception of the aministrator an one of Dillar’s chilren, an infant, the answers may be consiere as a full an circumstantial amission of the material- facts in issue.
The- aministrator enies all knowlege or information with regar to the levy, or sale of the property, or of any knowlege, unerstaning or agreement of his intestate, except that which he erive from the complainant’s bill, an touching these points oes not answer. The other allegations are from information an belief amitte. The infant efenant answers by guarian, an his rights are as fully protecte as if he ha by answer enie each allegation in the bill.
The main fact put in issue by the answer, is the fact of the allege mistake; an preliminary to an examination of the evience, is the question presente upon the exception to the amission of the eposition of Ogen. The objection to his evience is, that he is the security of the complainant to efenant Bailey for the purchase money of the lan in suit. It seems that Bailey at the outset was content to take the complainant’s bon, payable at twelve months, for the purchase money, an to hol the lan as secui’ity for the pa3'ment thereof. But when he ascertaine that there was a mistake in the numbers of the lan, whereby his security for the purchase money to the value of the lans not embrace in the ee ha faile, he became issatisfie an thereupon, by way of aitional security Ogen, Paschal, an others, execute to him a note for $1,000 payable at the same time the first note was to have been pai, with a memoranum enorse thereon by Bailey, that the payment of the bon first given shoul be a ischarge of the note,, whereby Ogen in effect became the security for the purchase money for the lan, part of which is now here in suit. This aitional security was taken in consequence of the iscovere mistake. There can be no question of Ogen’s immeiate interest in the suit; inee this is broaly amitte by counsel who notwithstaning argue that his interest is equally balance, because, let the suit be ecie for or against the complainant he must be ischarge. If for him, by requiring the $1,000 for which he is boun to- be pai before the ecree is renere, or if against him,, the court must necessarily rescin the contract, an cancel the note. As regars the first proportion, although the court might have ecree the payment ofthe purchase money at that time, it i not necessarily follow that such shoul be the ecree : an the ecree renere in this cause shows that such was not the case; so far from it, the express terms of the ecree are that the security shall not be ischarge. An, as respects the .other alternative, a rescisión of the contract is wholly inconsistent, as well with the allegations as the prayer for relief; au the answer of Bailey furnishes no groun for enlarging the issue. If the plaintiff ha oubts as to his title to the specific relief praye, he ■shoul have presente his case in a ouble, aspect, an praye relief accoringly. Story Equity Pl. 42. Moore vs. Maen, 2 Eng. 530.
Bailey no oubt was willing that the correction shoul be mae, his answer is alone responsive to that state of case, but it by no means follows that he woul assent to have his contract can-celle, an the eviences of ebt surrenere, upon a mere question of partial failure of consieration, nor can it be that a chancellor woul ecree that he shoul o so, unless upon an issue for that purpose an upon which he might be hear in efence, it be foun equitable that it shoul be one, so that the witness coul not -escape his liabilily upon either alternative; certainly not in the last, an it seems he i not in the first. He was clearly incompetent to testify, an his eposition shoul have been suppresse.
The remaining evience is by no means satisfactory upon the most important points in issue: the actual levy an sale of the lan not inclue in the sheriff’s return.
As regars the levy, the facts that the process was against Dillar, that there was returne upon the writ about the same quantity of lan really owne by him, that the valuation was taken at his instance, an that the appraisers i actually appraise the property known as Dillar’s homestea place, are all strong circumstances, an yet there is no positive proof that the sheriff ever intene to levy, or i levy upon these lans; but on the contrary, there are his official returns on several writs, his avertisement an ee, all his official acts which show affirmatively that he i not make such levy. As regars the sale, but one witness is foun to testify. He is strongly impresse with the belief that the sheriff announce to the by-staners that he offere the Dillar homestea place; of this he is not positive, an oes not remember the language use, nor can he say positively, that the sheriff i more than rea off the numbers from his levy, but thinks he i. This witness says that there were some forty persons present, an the fact that out of that number but one witness was examine as to the unerstaning at the time of the sale, in regar to the property sol, reners it improbable that if the property was offere as Dillar’s homestea, it was generally so unerstoo by the biers an by-staners.
The evience, upon which a written instrument or contract is altere or correcte, must be clear an free from oubt. In Henkle vs. The Royal Exchange Insurance Company, 1 Ves. 317, Lor Harwick sai the court ha jurisiction to relieve in re-. spect to a plain mistake in contracts in writing. In Ingram vs. Chil 1 Bro. 94, Lor Thurlow sai, “that a mistake creating an equity e hors the ee, shoul be proven as much to the satisfaction of the court as if amitte.” Juge Story in Unite States vs. Monroe, 5 Mason 577, sai “in cases of asserte mistakes in written instruments, it is not enie that a court of equity may reform the instrument, but such a court is very slow to exercise such an authority, an it requires the strongest an clearest evience to establish the mistake. It is not sufficient that there be some reason to presume a mistake, the evience must be clear, unequivocal an. ecisive.” An in Gillaspie vs. Moore, 2 Johns, Ch. Rep., Chancellor Kent reviews many of the English ecisions an fully recognizes the rule, that in all such cases the mistake must be clearly an fully proven.
So that this rule, when applie to contracts, may be consiere as well settle, an there certainly is no goo reason why the rule shoul not also be applie with equal force to the return ot a sworn officer, an to his ee eliberately mae an approve in court. Whilst therefore, corrections may be mae of mistakes when clearly an satisfactorily proven to be such, less than this strictness woul be attene with the most serious consequences, particularly where the instrument to be reforme or change is, as in this instance, the evience of title to real estate,
When teste by this rule, the evience before us, although it oes raise a strong presumption that the levy an sale were mae or intene to be mae of Dillar’s entire homestea tract, is not of that clear an conclusive character to entitle the complainant to relief.
We have not overlooke the groun taken by counsel, that the sale was mae uner a fi.fa., with a former levy enorse thereon, instea of a ven. ex. to sell the lans so levie upon, an that the whole tract was offere together instea of separate tracts, an also that the lans now sought to be recovere were (if sol at all) sol without having been previously avertise. These are all questions which may well be consiere in a suit like this, in the nature of a bill for specific performance, because courts of equity will not interfere to ecree specific execution of a contract, where manifest wrong or injustice woul result from it. To o so woul be giving ai to consummate a wrong commence, which is never one, 2 Story Equity 53.
It is true, that in this case the process an proceeings uner which the sale was mae, in connexion with the return, in which no formal levy appears to have been mae uner the secon writ, are of a oubtful character, (in regar to which, however, it is not necessary, uner the circumstances of this case, to express any opinion) an that the sale of the lans in ispute (if mae at all) was mae without notice an purchase by the attorney for the plaintiff in execution for $500, when, accoring to the appraise value mae some time before the sale took place, they were worth $7,900 or more, an by evience in this case, since the sale, $3000. §o that the lan was sol in all reasonable probability, for less than one-sixth of its actual value. All of these circumstances woul have been presente for consieration if the mistake as allege ha been satisfactorily proven.
.But as .such proof has not been auce, in view of the whole case .an the peculiar attitue in which the parties are presente upon the recor, an the facts connecte with their respective fights, we .think the ecree of the Circuit Court shoul be reverse an the bill ismisse.
Let the ecree be reverse, an the cause be remane with instructions to ismiss the bill with costs.

The eclaration was in ebt upon a writing obligatory, averring that it was mae by the efenant, Allis, payable to the plaintiff, Bener, “by the style of D. Bener, & Co.” At the return term, after oyer grante, Allis pleae that he i not make the writing obligatory, payable to the plaintiff, Bener, by the style of D. Bener & Co., as allege in the eclaration, but that he mae it payable to sai Bener an one James A. Henry, as partners, by the name, style, escription an firm of D. Bener & Co., an of which he put himself upon the country. A emurrer was interpose, an the causes assigne were : 1st, that the plea was not sworn to; 2, that it conclue to the country, an not with a verification; an 3, that it was frivolous. The emurrer was sustaine an final jugment was renere for the plaintiff below, an the cause brought here by writ of error.
Accoring to the course of ecisions in this court, the emurrer i not reach the first objection. To o this a motion to strike out was necessary. (Wilson & Turner vs. Shannon & wife, 1 Eng. R. 196. Harwick et al. vs. Campbell, &c., 2 Eng. R. 118. Mayor & Alermen of Little Rock vs. State Bank, 3 Eng. R. 227. State Bank vs. War, 3 Eng. R. 506. Knott vs. Clements a. 13 Ark. R. 335.)
The averment in the eclaration that the writing obligatory in question, was mae payable to the plaintiff, Bener, by the style of D. Bener ¿¡ Co., was a material an traversable one, accoring to the ecisions in the cases of Bower et al. vs. State Bank, 5 Ark. 236, an Nicholay et al. vs. Kay, 1 Eng. R. 70. An although, in general, it is the property of the plea of the “general issue,” in any form of action, to eny all the facts set forth in the eclaration, an to put the plaintiff on proof of every essential fact allege by him, it was expressly rule, in the last mentione case, that the plea of non est factum woul not traverse an allegation like this in question, an that that plea putting in issue only the sealing an elivery of the writing obligatory, amitte as true all the other material allegations in the eclaration. From this then it follows that the allegations in question coul only have been specially ha verse. This was the object contemplate by the plea in question; the legal sufficiency only of which, an not its form, or want of verification by affiavit, is brought in question by the emurrer.
As a special traverse, esigne for the enial of only one of the several facts allege in the eclaration, although it containe other matter, an was otherwise objectionable upon special emurrer, before that was abolishe, it properly conclue to the country. An it woul have been equally goo in substance, ha it conclue with a verification, (1 Sauners 103, a. b. n. (3,) tenering as it woul have one, a material issue an amitting; as the plea i, the truth of all the other allegations containe in the eclaration.
The plea was therefore not frivolous, but goo in substance, an the emurrer shoul have been overrule.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an appeal from the justice’s court to the Circuit Court, where, upon a trial e novo, the original efenant, after amitting the plaintiff’s eman, offere to prove an account ue from the plaintiff to him, as a matter of set-off, but upon the objection, that the efenant ha not given the plaintiff proper-notice of the propose set-off, while the case was in the justice’s court, the Circuit Court rule out the propose off-set. This action of the Circuit Court is the error assigne here.
It appears from the justice’s transcript, that upon the return ay of the summons, both parties appeare before the justice, an that the efenant then file a bill of the particulars of a set-off emane by him. This appears both by an entry upon the ocket an the justice’s enorsement of filing upon the bill of particulars. The efenant afterwars, the same ay, continue the cause for a month. At the next trial ay both parties were again present, an the cause was again continue by plaintiff. At the thir trial ay, both parties were again present, an, upon the hearing, the justice rule out the off-set upon the groun, as state in his transcript, of the “efenant’s failing to give the plaintiff notice of his off-set,” an thereupon gave jugment-for the plaintiff’s eman, an the efenant appeale.
Upon the trial in the Circuit Court, the efenant amitte the correctness of the plaintiff’s eman, but insiste upon the offset, that ha been rule out by the justice, an mae aitional proof by J. B. Lewis, who seems to have acte as his attorney, before the justice, that on the original trial ay before the justice at a time when the plaintiff was present in the house an before the cause was continue, the witness notifie the justice that he ha an off-set to file in the case, rea over the items in the hearing of the plaintiff, (but i not know whether the plaintiff actually i hear him,) an then hane it to the justice to file among the papers.
The statute provies that, upon the appeal, no other cause of action shall be trie in the Circuit Court than the same that was “trie before the justice, an no set-off shall be pleae that was not pleae before the justice, if the summons was serve on the person of the efenant, (Dig. p. 670, sec. 192.) It also provies that, “In orer to entitle a efenant to set-off any eman, he must give notice thereof to the plaintiff, either verbal or written, before the jury is sworn or the trial submitte to the justice,” (Dig. p. 652, se. 81, lut misprinte 71.) “An that when a set-off is foune upon an instrument in writing execute by the plaintiff, or his testator or intestate, or iipon an open account, he must, at the time of giving such notice, file with the justice such instrument, or a bill of the items of such account,” (Dig. p. 652, sec. 82.)
Consiering together these provisions of the statute we think the Legislature, without any intention to prescribe any particular moe of communicating notice, simply esigne to secure to the plaintiff notice in fact or its equivalent, as a pre-requisite for the efenant to set up an prove an off-set. This is strongly inicate by the inefinite provision,that notice maybe given either verbally or in writing, without any other regulation except that, as to time, it must be given before the jury is sworn or the trial is submitte to a justice. Hence it woul be as well communicate inirectly as irectly; either through the instrumentality of writing, or by wor of mouth, provie actual notice be in fact carrie home from the efenant to the plaintiff. Inee, so long as the cause remaine pening an unetermine before the justice, it-woul be in accorance with the spirit of the statute for the justice to receive a set-off at any time, an if the filing, whether before or on the ay of trial, be a surprise to. the plaintiff, he might claim a continuance, but being in court he is presume to have notice.
When the testimony of Lewis is consiere in connection with what is legitimately to be inferre from the justice’s transcript, the whole taken together are equivalent, in our opinion, to proof of actual notice. Whether or not the testimony of Lewis was prouce in the justice’s court, oes not in any manner appear, but this can in no way affect the existence of the fact of notice, upon which epene the right of the efenant to be hear as to his set-off, before the justice as well as upon his appeal before the Circuit Court, where the case is hear e novo absolutely, an hot e novo upon conition that some error of fact or law may be foun as in cases of appeal from the Probate Court.
Upon the establishment in the Circuit Court of this pre-requisite to his set-off, it woul be as unreasonable to refuse to hear him as to the whole of it, as it woul be to eny him a hearing, as to some one item only, in another case where, upon a regular trial upon the merits in the justice’s court, he ha faile to make proof as to this item only, although he ha prove all the others, an was now reay to prove this also.
We think, therefore, the court erre in ruling out the off-set, an for this error the jugment ought to be reverse, an the cause remane with instructions that the Circuit Court hear the case e novo, an allow the efenant below to establish his off* set on file by sufficient evience if he can.",legal_case,positive

On the 3 ay of October, 1851, the Bank eclare in ebt upon a promissory note mae by the efenant,- on the 22 ay of November, 1843, payable 12 months after ate. There was but one count in the eclaration. The efenant by plea interpose the statute of limitation.
The Bank replie, first; That on the ay of the execution of the note the efenants, together with their wives, execute a mortgage to her, upon certain real estate, to secure the ebt sue ' for; in which it was recite that by the rules an regulations of the Bank the note in question was payable in nine annual installments, the first payable twelve months after the ate thereof, at which time, in aition thereto, twelve months interest was to be pai in avance on the resiue of the ebt, an so on from year to year until the whole ebt shoul be pai, an proviing that in case the payments were so regularly mae, that the conveyance shoul be voi, but on failure in all or either of sai payments, the sheriff of Pulaski county shoul sell an convey the mortgage premises an apply the procees to the payment of the ebt; an averring that on the 1st March, A. D. 1848, the ebt being then wholly in arrears, neither the first nor any sub1 sequent instalment or any interest having been pai, the sheriff, in pursuance of the request of the Bank an of the provisions of the mortgage, avertise a sale of the mortgage premises, to take place in September following; whereupon Trapnali, claiming to be the owner of the mortgage premises, file a bill against the Bank, an procure an injunction restraining the Bank an the sheriff from proceeing any further with the sale, an that the bill is still pening an unetermine, an the injunction remains in force, by means whereof, as is allege, the Bank was prevente from pursuing her remey on the note aforesai.
The secon replication avers that the mortgage was mae cotemporaneously with the note eclare upon, as part an parcel of the same transaction, to secure the payment of the ebt, an that in the mortgage ee it was stipulate an eclare that sai note was payable in nine annual instalments, the first payable the 22 November, A- D. 1844, with interest, in avance on the resiue of the ebt, an yearly thereafter as set out in the first replication, an that the Bank accepte the mortgage, an that the same is still in force an in no way satisfie.
After oyer of the mortgage ee ha been crave an grante, the efenant emurre to both replications, in which the plaintiff joine; an the law having been foun for the efenant an the plaintiff electing to rest, jugment was renere for the efenant, an the Bank brought her case here by writ of error.
The Bank seems to rely in this court exclusively upon her first replication, an cites in support of it the twenty-seventh section-of the limitation statute, {Dig, ch. 99, p. 700), which provies that-“whenever the commencement of any suit shall be staye by an-injunction of any court of equity, the time uring which such in-junction shall be in force, shall not be eeme any portion of the-time in this act limite for the commencement of such suit.” ‘ If the Bank was proceeing to foreclose her mortgage, an the sta-tute of limitations ha been interpose, this provision of the sta-tute might, with more plausibility have been relie upon; but we think it clear that it cannot avail her, to isplace the bar in this case, where she is preceing at law to recover the ebt that was intene to be secure by the mortgage. The replication oes not set.up that the Bank was enjoine from commencing any action to recover the ebt, but from any “further proceeings in the matter of sai- sale,” an “restraining the sai Bank an the sai sheriff from- selling sai lots.” For aught that appears to the contrary in the replication, the Bank might have commence a suit at law, to recover the ebt for which the mortgage was but a security, at any time for near seven years, next before this action was commence; an inee this suit was commence an is still prosecute, as appears by this replication, pening the very injunction pleae in avoiance of the statute bar. It was the remey in rem only, that was enjoiue, not the inepenent remey in personam, now sought in vain by reason of the statute bar, which lapse of time has enable the efenants effectually to interpose against it.
The secon replication is equally ba,-because it oes not set up any matter in support of the promise eclare-upon, but a ifferent contract, which, if effectual for the purpose- for which it is-set up, woul be equally effectual to show that the Bank ha no right to maintain an action of ebt at all, when this one was commence.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The first groun of exception in this case is as to the correctness of the ecision of the Circuit Court in sustaining the plaintiffs emurrei'jto the efenants plea in abatement. The matter pleae in abatement was a varíen ce between the writ of summons an a copy of the summons serve upon the efenant. This was no groun for abating the action; at most it was an inirect attack upon the sheriff’s return. If the sheriff ha not, in fact, serve the efenant with a true copy of the writ, an ha falsely returne a vali service, it might become the subject of inquiry upon a irect proceeing against him for a false return, but was no groun whatever for abating the writ. Hughes vs. Martin, 1 Ark. Rep. 386. The plea shoul have been stricken out! There was no necessity for emurring to it, but the objection by emurrer was also goo. An issue-upon it, if tenere, woul, in fact, have settle nothing beyon a question of service.
The secon groun is that after a jugment by efault an upon inquiry of amages before the jury, the efenant was ene the privilege of cross-examining the witnesses introuce to establish the amount of amages sustaine.
In this we think there was error. By failing to appear an. efen, or after having appeare an pleae in abatement, the failure of the efenant to plea in bar, was a confession of the plaintiff’s right to recover amages, an although after such efault or failure to plea, the efenant coul not be hear to eny that some amages were recoverable, still, it was not an amission of any particular amount of amages. If so, there woul be no necessity for a writ of inquiry of amages; an although we have not foun any ajuicate case settling the practice in such cases, we can see no goo reason why the efenant shoul be eprive of his right to cross-examine the witnesses introuce by the plaintiff upon the trial of the inquiry of amages, in orer to show truly what amages ha been sustaine.
In this case we o not know what the question intene to be aske was, nor o we know the range of enquiry inulge upon the examination in chief. The opinion of the court woul seem to eny all cross-examination, irrespective of the nature or extent of the enquiry. Without, therefore, knowing what the particular state of case was, or intening to be unerstoo as eciing that any an all evience, which, uner proper issues forme, woul ten to lessen the amount of amages, may be offere by the efenant upon an inquiry of amages, uner the state of case pre sente we think the Circuit Court erre in refusing the efenant permission to cross-examine the plaintiff’s witnesses. An for this error the jugment of the Circuit Court must be reverse, an the cause remane.",legal_case,negative

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The plaintiffs in error being sue by the Bank, upon a note which they ha mae payable to her, interpose a plea, setting up certain matters in abatement. The plea, on motion of the plaintiff below, was stricken from the files, to which the efenants excepte, an suffere final jugment.
Inasmuch as the plea, re-instate upon the recor by the bill of exceptions, appears to be applicable to the action, an, for aught that appears, pleae in apt time, goo in form, signe by counsel an verifie by affiavit; in short, having all the formal requisites of a plea, our opinion is, that it ought to have been emurre to, if the plaintiff below woul question its legal sufficiency. This point was expressly rule in Sillivant vs. Rearon, 5 Ark. 140, followe by Wilson vs. Shannon, 1 Eng. 198. In Pope vs. Tunstall, 2 Ark. 209, the question of practice was waive, because the court thought the plea which ha been stricken out in that case, was goo in substance as well as form, an therefore felt at liberty to consier the case in the same light as if the pleaings ha come up on emurrer. But the case last referre to cannot be safely followe as a preceent, because the refusal of the court in any case that might come before it, to consier the legal,sufficiency of a plea, which ha been improperly stricken out on motion, woul be an implie ecision against its legal sufficiency; whereas, accoring to the establishe rules of pleaing, the proper moe of tenering an issue in law is by emurrer; an without breaking own those rules the emurrant cannot evae it by an informal motion, so as to eprive the efenant of all benefit of any question of law upon the legal sufficiency of the plea, unless he shall get it again upon the recor by bill of exceptions.
True, a plea, apparently goo on its face, might well be struck from the files, because frivolous or vexatious ; as for example, where the same matter is attempte to be pleae, which the court has once ajuge insufficient, an the pleaer coul only rest upon the ecision, or plea over. But nothing of the kin is shown here. An so, like many other legal istinctions, where the lines run into one another, it might sometimes be ifficult to etermine whether a party shoul move to strike from the files, or be put to his emurrer. But accoring as one or the other may be proper, the office of a emurrer cannot be subserve by a motion.
At an early ay, Means vs. Cromwell, 1 Ark. 247, this court foun it necessary to check the practice which ha grown up, of interposing by informal motions, not traversable or tenering any issue of fact, matters in abatement, or which properly belonge to that class of efences. An without any particular examination of that or the several subsequent cases to the same purport, there can be no oufitthat the general tenency of them to iscourage such innovations in pleaing was right.
