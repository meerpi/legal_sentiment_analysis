1862633,Newton vs. The State Bank,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1848-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker
elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of ejectment, brought by Newton'against the Bank, for the recovery of certain lots of lan in the city of Little Rock.
Newton claime title to the lots as a purchaser at sheriff’s sale, an at the trial of the case prouce a recor showing a jugment against the Bank, an execution uly returne, showing a regular levy on the lots, their avertisement an sale accoring to law, an also, the sheriff’s ee, uly acknowlege an recore.
The Bank (the efenant in execution) then offere to prove by parol evience that the sale to the plaintiff was mae without notice, on a ay subsequent to that state in the sheriff’s return; to the introuction of which the plaintiff objecte, upon the grounhat such evience-was inamissible to contraict the return of the sheriff, an the recitals in the ee in that particular. But the Circuit Court overrule the objection, an permitte such evience to be given to the jury; to which the plaintiff excepte. An the amission of this evience over the objection of the plaintiff, presents the only important question to be etermine.
The act of the Legislature, which requires the sheriff to recite the names of the parties, the ate of the writ an of the jugment, together with a escription of the time, place,, an manner of the sale; an which makes such recitals evience of the facts so recite, was intene by the Legislature to supersee the necessity for proucing the recor, from which such recitals were mae, as a matter of convenience, an to furnish evience of the authority uner which the officer acte, as well as the manner in which he ha execute his authority in the ee itself. Not that the recitals shoul be conclusive evience of the facts recite; for that woul exclue all inquiry into the authority uner which the sheriff acte; but that it shoul be legal, competent evience, until falsifie by evience of a higher an more authentic character. The acts of an- officer one in obeience to the law, when require to be certifie an returne, form a part of the recors of the case in which they are ha; Lawson v. Main, 4 Ark. 186; an being part of the recors, the return, as well as the execution an the jugment, imports absolute verity, an is alike conclusive as the jugment, upon the rights of the parties to the recor. It is upon this principle that this court, in the case of Jamison v. May, 6 Eng. 374, hel parol evience inamissible to contraict a sheriff’s return upon a writ of summons. An this ecision of ours is fully sustaine by numerous authorities, an ajuge cases, in several of which the question arose uner circumstances strikingly similar to the case before us. Thus, in the case of Love & Williams v. Powell, 5 Ala. 58; in a suit to try title, where the plaintiff claime uner a sheriff’s ee, the court hel parol evience inamissible to contraict the sheriff’s return, an in conclusion the court sai, “ Our conviction is that the ee is conclusive an cannot be impeache on a collateral issue, except for frau in the execution of the ee, when*the process uner which the lan was sol is supporte by an existing unsatisfie jugment.”
In the case of Jackson vs. Roberts, 7 Wen. 86, the sheriff’s ee escribe the sale as having been mae uner execution in favor of Hill & Stubbins. The efenant sought to isprove the truth of this recital bypai’ol evience. The court sai, the question is “Can that part of the sheriff’s ee be contraicte by parol evience, which sets forth the writ uner which the sale was mae ?” The court then refers to, an approves its former ecisions in the cases of Jackson vs. Vanenhayen, 17, John. 167, an Jackson vs. Croy, 12 John. R. 427, in which parol evience was hel inamissible to contraict a sheriff’s ee, an after commenting upon the effects of a ifferent rule, the court conclue its opinion with the following remarks : “We see no formiable mischief likely to result from the operation0of such a principle. A party who may be injure by the mistake of a sheriff can have relief by a summary application to the courts uner whose authority the sheriff acts, or through the meium of a court of equity ; an it is much better that he shoul be confine to this moe of reress, than to rener all titles erive uner juicial sales oubtful, an subject to be efeate by allowing the written instruments, by which they are evience, to be attacke collaterally by parol evience.”
Chief Justice Sharkey says, in Minor vs. Select Men of Natchez, 4. S & Mar. 619. “The purchaser is not put upon enquiry as to the regularity of the jugment. In the official character of the sheriff an his general power erive from that character, purchasers have a guaranty that they will be protecte in their title.” Savage Ch. J., in the case of Jackson vs. Calwell, 1 Cow. Rep. 644, sai, “It may therefore be consiere as settle law, that a bona fie purchaser at a sheriff’s sale acquires a vali title as against the efenant in the execution, unless it is not only voiable but absolutely voi.”
The case of Trigg vs. Lewis, 3 Littell 131, lays own the general rule, an shows that it is peculiarly applicable to sheriff’s returns. The court says, “ It is a general rule that the acts of a ministerial officer, as far as the rights of the parties affecte thereby are concerne, must be taken as true, when brought into contest collaterally, an can only be impeache by a irect proceeing, such as makes the officer a party. This rule is peculiarly applicable to returns of sheriffs on process. Hence this court ecie in the case of Hornback vs. Smith, that the return of a sheriff on the writ of habere facias possessionem is conclusive. It is therefore clear that it was not competent for the efenant to aver an prove any thing against the return of the officer in this instance; such as the proof tenere by the replication, that the lan was not in fact sol, an that the proceeings relative thereto were not real.”
The ecisions are irectly in point, an may be consiere as conclusively settling the questions; First, that the return of the sheriff must be consiere an treate as part of the recors in the case; an seconly, that parol evience is inamissible to contraict it. The oor for re-investigation is close upon the parties to the recor. It is not to be questione by them; an this because they are parties to the recor, an have ay in court; an it is not only their interest but their uty to look to the regularity of the proceeings, an when passe without objection they may be sai in effect, to have receive the approval of the parties. An so with regar to the execution of final process. It is execute for their benefit by the officer of the law, an uring the whole time up to the sale an acknowlegment of the ee, they have ay in court, an it is their uty to see that the sale is conucte fairly; at least, if they shoul fail to o so, they have but little cause for complaint. The purchaser, a stranger, who ha no agency in proucing the irregularity, an no power to control or irect the action of the officer in any respect, who has bought in goo faith, an acquire a legal title, vali an regular upon the face of his ee, shoul be protecte in that title against those parties to the recor, who have stoo by an-without objection, suffere him to pay the purchase money, the benefit of which they receive, an receive a ee, sanctione an approve by the court without objection from,them. Uner such circumstances, as between the purchaser an the parties to the recor, it woul be wrong to suffer them, in a collateral proceeing, to introuce parol evience to contraict the recor evience of the purchaser’s title.
This question has been substantially settle by the ecision of this court in the case of The State Bank vs. Nolan an others; ecie at the last term of this court, where it is hel that after the purchaser has acquire title by sheriff’s ee approve an orere to be recore, at no subsequent time, after the lapse of that term, shall his title be questione for frau, accient, or mistake, or for any irregularity in the proceeings, which must as of necessity (in most instances) arise out of one or other of these causes, upon motion, or in a proceeing at common law. But where the proceeings were such as, in the first instance, to vest in him a legal title to the estate therein conveye, or, in the language of the court, when elivering its opinion in that case, “ When his legal title is perfect, an when the valiity of the title itself is assaile for frau, accient or mistake, arising out of the irregularity of the proceeings, or the acts of the parties, he has a right to be hear before a tribunal that can rightfully exercise jurisiction in such matters, with power an process to bring all the parties in interest before it, to put them upon their consciences to answer; to cancel the ee; to restore possession ; an to awar equitable compensation.”
How far, or uner what circumstances the return of the sheriff an the recitals in the ee may be questione in a irect proceeing in chancery, for that purpose, or where frau is allege in the execution of the ee, we are not now calle upon to ecie; because, in the case before us, no offer was mae to introuce evience to prove frau. It is true that proof that the sale was mae after the ay fixe by law, an without notice, might, when taken in connection with other evience, conuce to prove frau. An if the efenant ha propose this in connection with other evience, for that purpose, the question woul have arisen as to its amissibility in a common law court- upon a collateral issue. But the avowe object of the efenant was to falsify an isprove the return of the sheriff, as to the time of the sale an the notice given. This, we have sai, coul not be one. An upon examination of the authorities cite by counsel, in which parol evience was amitte to isprove the return of the officer, it will be foun that in Tennessee such evience was allowe to prove a want of notice, because the statute of that State eclare the sale voi, without notice. An so also in Kentucky, as to the quantity of lan to be sol. The statute forbi the sale of more lan than woul pay the ebt. This was a violation of a prohibitory, not a irectory statute. In the case in 5 Blackf. 260, the strongest, case referre to by counsel, the evience was amitte to prove a frau. An none of them are applicable to the state of case before us. , The counsel has, in an ingenious argument, eneavore to bring them to bear upon this case, by assuming that if the sale shoul be proven to be on a ay subsequent to the first ay of the return term, it woul be voi, because the execution was not then in force, an conferre no power on the sheriff to sell, an that parol evience was amissible to prove the sale voi, as hel in Tennessee, Kentucky an Iniana. This groun- was, we apprehen, taken uner a misapprehension of the statute. It is true that the statute irects the sale to be mae on the first ay of the return term, but makes the writ returnablé on the secon ay of the term, Dig. Ch. 67, sec. 9; anthis, as appears from the efenant’s own evience, was theay on which the sale was in fact mae, although returne by the sheriff as mae on the first ay of the term. A sale mae on the return ay of the writ is vali. Blaisall vs. Sheife, 5 New. 11, 201. Tayloe vs. Gaskins, 1 Dev. 295.
The sale then was not voi for want of power in the sheriff to sell, an as regars the irregularity in selling on a ay ifferent from that irecting sheriff’s sales an without notice, these are irregularities which arise in the exercise of power conferre. A eparture by the officer from the statutory irections, as to the manner of executing his power, oes not affect the title of a bona fie purchaser at sheriff’s sale. This has been so repeately ecie by this court that it may now be hel as settle law. Aamson et al. vs. Cummins a. 5 Eng. 541. Byers & McDonal, vs. Fowler,et al. 7 Eng. 218. Whiting & Slark, vs. Beebe, et al. 7 Eng. 421.
But even if a oubt coul arise as to the correctness of these ecisions in orinary cases, it is very questionable whether this case woul come uner the rule as lai own by the authorities most favorable to the efenant’s case; for the statute in regar to sales mae after the property has been regularly avertise an bi off, an where the purchaser refuses to pay the sum bi, irects a re-sale, but is silent both as to the time an manner of sale. No oubt the officer may, on the same ay, re-offer the property for sale, an then there woul be no necessity for notice, but suppose, as is no oubt the case in most instances, in counties where there is much litigation, that the sheriff shoul not fin time after selling, to hunt up the purchaser an make his settlement with him, or upon a refusal of the purchaser to pay the sum bi, to re-sell the property at once. It is evient that in many instances a large number of sales woul be postpone by sham bis, procure to be mae by irresponsible biers, an if the sheriff is not allowe to sell the property on another ay, it woul result in incalculable elay an mischief. When, however, he comes to fix the ay, the law is silent both as to time, place an notice. Shoul he refer to the statute he coul erive no ai from it as a preceent, for it was certainly not intene to wait until the first ay of the next succeeing term ; nor as regars notice, that thirty ays shoul be allowe ; but on the contrary of this the statute is silent, an by its other provisions seems to contemplate a summary sale, by which, however, the efenant an the plaintiff are both protecte against ultimate loss, by holing the first bier responsible over for any loss which may arise, in case the property shoul not sell for as much at the secon as it i at the first sale. Thus the first purchaser is mae to stan between the efenant an loss occasione by his refusal to pay the price for which the property sol at the appointe time by law an upon regular notice.
In the case uner consieration the efenant, by her attorney, was the first bier, to whom the property was struck off, at a sale amitte to be in all respects regular. Upon a refusal of the attorney to pay the sum bi, the property, as appears by the sheriff’s return, was thereupon at once re-sól, an as the efenant contens, it was sol the next ay after. The secon sale then was the result of the act of the efenant, who became, uner the statute, responsible for any loss that might accrue by reason of the secon sale. If loss, then ha accrue, it woul have been his own fault, an upon his own responsibility. Bnt in truth no loss in this instance accrue; for the property sol for as much at the secon, as it i at the first sale, an consequently no injury resulte from the secon sale.
If the officer, uninfluence by the conuct of the purchaser, ha abuse his official power to the prejuice of the rights of the Bank, he is responsible to her for amages, or if, by the combine action of the officer an the purchaser a frau has been perpetrate to the inj ury of the Bank, she must apply to a court competent to affor relief; but in a common law court the valiity of a sheriff’s ee cannot be questione by parol evience touching irregularities, not affecting the power an authority in the officer to sell an execute such ee.
There is no oubt but that the Circuit Court erre in permitting parol evience to be given to the jury to contraict the return of the sheriff an the recitals in the ee. An for this error the jugment of the Pulaski Circuit Court must be set asie an reverse, an the cause remane for further proceeings to be ha accoring to law, an not inconsistent with this opinion.

This case, it seems, has been twice before this court heretofore; an now two questions only are presente by the recor, which it will be material to notice.
The first relates to the introuction of the original recor of the jugment in evience, uner the plea of nul tiel recor. The objection, however, is not seriously urge, an is consiere untenable, as the recor correspons in every respect with the allegations of the eclaration. The secon is, that the court below erre in permitting afi.fa. to be rea in evience on the trial of an issue, that there was no such writ as that escribe an set forth in the eclaration. Thefi. fa. as escribe in the eclaration, was sue out against Laban C. Howell, an William Moore, commaning the sheriff, that of the goos an chattels of Laban C. Howell, an William Moore, he cause to be mae “as well a certain ebt of six hunre an fifty-eight ollars an thirty-six cents, as the further sum of sixty-seven ollai’s an fifty cents amages, together with all costs of suitthat rea in evience commans the sheriff, that of the goos, &c., of Laban C. Howell, an ""William Moore, he cause to be mae the sum of seven hunre an twenty-five ollars an eighty-six cents, ebt an amages, together with the sum of nine ollars an thirty cents costs.” The recital of the writ of Ji. fa. in the eclaration was matter of inucement, an that permitte to be rea in evience was, in substance, the same as that escribe in the eclaration. The case of Rector vs. Taylor, Gariner & Co., ecie at the July Term, 1851, of this court; Webb vs. Jones & Prescott, 2 Ark. 33, State Bank vs. Magness et al. 6 Eng. Rep. 343, State Bank vs. Arnol et al, ib. 347, sustain this view, we think, fully.
The jugment of the court below must be affirme with costs.

elivere the opinion of the Court. This was an action on the case for eceit in the sale of a mare. The cause was before this court at July term, 1850, reporte in 6 Eng. 338. On the trial ha after the remaning of the cause, the plaintiff ha jugment for amages, foun by the jury. The efenants move for a new trial, which was refuse, an they excepte, setting out the evience an the instructions given.
The facts of the case appear to be that the efenants being inebte to the plaintiff in the sum of $215, for a tract of lan he ha sol them, he agree to receive payment in property, to be appraise at its cash value. The property consiste of a wagon, value by the appraisers selecte, at $115, an the mare in question, value at $100, which the plaintiff receive of the efenants in payment of their ebt to him. This was in April, 1849; soon afterwars, the plaintiff iscovere that the animal’s eyes were efective, an in the summer following, she w as totally blin, an of little or no value. The plaintiff offere to return her before suit. As usual, in cases of this escription, there was a clou of witnesses, an much conflicting testimony. But wherever there is any testimony to uphol a verict, we must consier as facts, so much of the evience as oes uphol it. All the parties, an several of the witnesses were present at the time of the sale. It is not positively proven that the mare’s eyes were efective at that time, an the weight of testimony seems to be the other way: the efect, if it existe, appears to have escape the observation of the witnesses, none of whom examine her eyes. Nor is it clear that the efenants knew of the efect, an purposely conceale it with the view of practicing a frau on the plaintiff; but there is evience of the eclarations of the efenants conucing to show that they i know it.
One Joseph Turner was amitte as a witness for the efenants, an his testimony appears to have been receive without objection, no oubt uner a mistaken view of the former ecision of this court. It was there hel that he swearing he ha no interest in the event of the suit, it was competent for him to prove that he, an not the efenants mae the sale to the plaintiff, an for the error in excluing the proof of that fact propose to be mae by him, the first jugment in the plaintiff’s favor was reverse. This witness, on the secon trial, state that the mare belonge to him, an never i belong to the efenants: that he bargaine with the efenants for part of the lan they ha bought of the plaintiff, an agree with them to pay $100 of their ebt to the plaintiff, an accoringly brought his mare to the place appointe, to be value, an at that time the mare’s eyes were soun, as far as he knew. It appears from evience of eclarations mae by the efenants an Joseph Turner, that he was liable to the efenants for the costs of the suit, an the amages that might be recovere against him, an that they ha not conveye him his part of the lan, an i not inten to o so, unless he pai the jugment, in case it went against them. The testimony of this witness, in effect, is not inconsistent with the other testimony that he, for a consieration as between him an the efenants, furnishe them with the mare to pay in part their ebt to the plaintiff, an it is ifficult to perceive why he was not intereste, an altogether incompetent. His creibility, however, was the only question before the jury, so far as his testimony is concerne; an accoring as the jury believe the witnesses, we cannot say they were not justifie in concluing that the parties in this transaction practice a cheat on the plaintiff, by means of a secret efect known to themselves, but not apparent on inspection!
Only two points are mae in argument for the appellant; an both of these are covere by the instructions given by the court, an are respone to by the jury. The first is, that the plaintiff’s eclaration alleges that the efenants sol him the mare in consieration of a hunre ollars lawful money, an the proof is, that the ebt of the efenants was payable in property; an that for this variance between the allegation an the proof, the plaintiff is not entitle to recover. Without going into the istinction, not clearly efine in the books, between actions upon contract where the statement of the special contract is matter of escription, material to be prove as state, an actions for tort, arising out of contract, where the statement of the contract is matter of substance, only an by way of inucement to the particular grievance complaine of, it is a sufficient answer, that there was also evience that this ebt was ue in money, although the plaintiff was willing it shoul be ischarge in property at its cash value, an on this point the court charge the jury, on the motion of the efenants, that if they believe the mare was elivere to the plaintiff in part payment of a pre-existing property ebt, it woul not be sufficient to satisfy the allegation in the eclaration, that the consieration pai by the plaintiff was one hunre ollars lawful money.
It is also argue that the court below ought to have grante a new trial, because the proof fails to show that the efenants frauulently conceale the efect in the eyes of the animal. This, as a question of fact, was peculiarly within the province of the jury, an if they ha foun it for the efenants, the court might well acquiesce in their verict. The efenants ha the full benefit of the instruction aske for them, an which the court gave in charge to the jury; that in orer to entitle the plaintiff to a verict it must appear; first, that the efenants sol the mare; secon, that they sol her for the consieration lai in the eclaration ; thir, that the mare was unsoun, that such unsounness was known to the efenants, an that they conceale the fact from the plaintiff, or faile to make it known to him.
So, in the instructions given on the plaintiff’s motion, the court put the enquiry to the jury, whether the efect in the mare’s eyes was known to the efenants, an whether it was of such a nature that the plaintiff coul not iscover it by orinary inspection.
Certainly it is the octrine of the common law, subject to some exceptions, which have no application to this case, that in the sale of a chattel for a soun price, there is no implie warranty of a soun article. The immorality of this rule is counterbalance by the tenency to vexatious litigation, which woul be encourage by the opposite rule of the civil law. The common law requires vigilance an pruence on the part of the purchaser, an he may protect himself by requiring an express warranty of sounness. Yet the common law requires goo faith an fair ealing between the parties to a contract; an it is well settle that the sale of a chattel may be avoie for a frauulent concealment of a efect known to the venor, an not iscoverable on orinary inspection by the venee. The venor is not boun to isclose efects which are open to the observation of both parties, but if he conceal such as are not thus visible, an which rest exclusively within his own knowlege, it is a eceit for which the venee may isaffirm the contract an recover amages commensurate with his injury. The common law is free from the reproach which a contrary octrine woul impute to it. In Dillar’s a. vs. Moore, 2 Eng. 171, the efence, that eceit ha been practice in the sale of a chattel allege to be unsoun, interpose to a suit to recover the purchase money was isallowe, because the efect, although known to the venor, was patent an visible, an therefore presume to have been known also by the venee; but there is nothing in the opinion which favors the iea that what the law conemns as a frau can be practice without reress to the innocent or unoffening party, who exercise orinary pruence an iligence in guaring against eception!

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was a scire facias issue the 30th ay of April 1850, to revive a jugment, which, accoring to the recital of the writ, was renere in the Pulaski Circuit Court, in favor of the plaintiff, against the efenant, on the 25th ay of October, 1835. The efenant, Lee, pleae nul tiel recor an payment upon which issues were joine. The efenant, Fowler, pleae in abatement; first: that at the time of suing out the writ of scire facias, there was no such person in being as the plaintiff, Bolinger: secon, that the scire facias was issue more than ten years after the renition of the jugment, without any leave of the court being obtaine for its issuance: thir, that it was so issue without any previous motion in court, supporte by affiavit that the jugment still remaine unsatisfie. A emurrer being sustaine to the plea in abatement, no further efence was interpose by Fowler. Upon the trial of the issue on the plea of nul tiel recor interpose by the efenant, Lee, the court rejecte the recor offere in evience by the plaintiff, to prove the recovery recite in the writ; an the recor so offere is set out in the bill of exceptions taken by the plaintiff.
The court below having rejecte the evience, we are boun to presume in favor of the correctness of its ecision, until the plaintiff in error will show to this court the particular wherein the court below erre. We cannot know what recor of the original recovery may have remaine in the court below, except so far as the bill of exceptions has mae it a part of the recor sent here. The only evience appearing in the bill of exceptions, is what purports to be the recor entry of a jugment entere nunc pro tunc, as of a previous term in favor of Bolinger v. Fowler an Lee, as his security in appeal, but no other proceeings are shown, nor oes it appear in what court, or at what time the jugment was renere. Conceing every thing in favor of the jurisiction of the court renering the jugment sought to be revive, both as-to the subject matter an the parties, the omission to prouce a recor of a recovery corresponing in ate with the jugment, as recite in the scire facias, amounte to such a variance as woul authorize the court below to reject the evience
Although if there be a jugment against two or more, no goo reason can be perceive, why the plaintiff may not bring his action of ebt, upon the jugment against any one of them separately, yet it seems the statutory proceeing to revive an continue the lien by scire facias, must be against all jointly, Greer vs. The State Bank, 5 Eng. 456, unless one of the efenants be ea, Finn vs. Crabtree, 7 Eng. 597. But being sue jointly, whether in any orinary action, or by scire facias is immaterial, if the efence be such as necessarily enures to the benefit of both efenants. So that, when Lee ha 'jugment in his favor, upon the plea of nul tiel recor, both efenants must have been ischarge from the action.
The last two pleas of the efenant, Fowler, were emurrable accoring to Alexaner vs. Steele, at January Term 1853; but the matter set up in his first plea was sufficient to abate the writ. See 1 Chitty Plea. 448, an cases cite. Any objection to the plea because not sworn to, was only available on motion to strike out or isregar it. If the facts be well pleae, the office of a emurrer, which amits them to be true, is to question their legal sufficiency.

elivere the opinion of the Court. The plaintiff in error has appeale from the jugment of the court below, ismissing his suit for the want of a sufficient bon for costs. The objections to the bon appear to be, that the ay of the month of its ate is left blank, an that it is given by a firm, signe by their firm name an style uner seal. The suit was commence on the 18th of September, 1851, an the bon for costs has the following enoi’sement, signe by the clerk: “The above bon approve by me, September 18,1851, an file before writ issue.” On the hearing before the court of the issue upon the efenant’s motion to ismiss, the plaintiff prouce the bon an enorsement referre to, an mae part of the recor, an the facts in evience were, that the bon in question ha been file before the commencement of the suit, an approve by the clerk of the court as sufficient: that it ha been signe, seale, an elivere by J. H. Patterson, one of the firm of Byers & Patterson; that he was a resient of this State an responsible for the costs which might accrue in the suit in question; an that the plaintiff was a non-resient;
The statute requires the non-resient plaintiff, about to commence a suit in any circuit court, to file in the office of the clerk, the obligation of some responsible person, being a resient of this State, for the payment of all costs which may accrue in such action'.
The question here is not whether one partner can bin his co-partner, by an instrument uner seal, so as to make the firm liable upon an obligation execute by one in their joint names, nor is there any question as to what authority or assent by the partner not signing will be sufficient to make such an obligation obligatory upon him. The bon was certainly execute by one of the firm, an as hel in Day vs. Lafferty, 4 Ark. 450, it is goo against him. Whenever it is amitte, as ecie in Ferguson vs. The State Bank, 6 Eng. 512, that the plea of non est factum goes onlyto thepersonal ischargeof the party pleaing it; anthatthe party, who execute the ee, continues liable, it follows that the statute in this case has been substantially complie with. Neither the efenant, nor any officer of the court, who may become intereste in the bon for costs, has any right to insist that there shall be more than one security for costs, if he be a solvent an responsible person. The case stans as if there were two securities, an one of them for any cause not liable on the bon or irresponsible.
The ate, though prima facie evience of the time of the execution is not necessary to the valiity of a ee, which takes effect from the time of its elivery.
If the Circuit Court thought the bon to be so informal or efective as likely to embarrass the efenant or the officers of the court, in the recovery upon it of their legal emans that woul accrue in the progress of the suit, it might, accoring to its iscretion, have rule the plaintiff to furnish a bon free from any such objection, as it woul, where there is a oubt of the continuing solvency of the security; but upon the facts state here, the ecision of the court absolutely ismissing the plaintiff’s suit is not, as we conceive, in accorance with strict law, or the reason of the statute.

elivere the opinion of the court; The bill of complaint of the appellant seeks to enjoin a jugment at law, obtaine against him in the Inepenence Circuit Court, by the efenant, Hynson. The bill sets out a history of the proceeings at law, which are, in substance, as follows: That on the 19th of September, 1842, Hynson commence suit against the complainant on a writing obligatory, execute by him to Hynson, at Dec. Term. 1842, he pleae to the action; 1st. payment; 2, that the plaintiff was inebte to him, in the sum of four thousan ollars, for a house an lot in the town of Bates-ville, sol an elivere to him, an for ivers moneys lent an avance, for merchanize sol, an for meical services renere by him to the plaintiff; 3, that after the writing obligatory ha become ue an payable, in pursuance of a mutual agreement between them, the efenant gave up to the plaintiff a house an lot then owne an possesse by the efenant, an which the plaintiff accepte in full satisfaction of the writing obligatory in question. Issues were forme upon the first two pleas, an the last one was ajuge ba on emurrer. .At Aug! term 1843, the efenant pleae, that since the commencement of the suit, the plaintiff ha been eclare a bankrupt, pursuant to the provisions of the act of Congress, whereby all his property an rights in action ha become veste in his assignee, who alone ha the right to recover the ebt then in suit, for the benefit of the creitors of such bankrupt. To this plea the plaintiff replie, that, on the 1st September, 1842, before he became bankrupt, an more than two months before the filing of his petition, he sol an elivere the writing obligatory in question, to James Pope an William Byers, for a valuable consieration, in goo faith, an without any notice on their part, of his intention to become a bankrupt; an that the suit upon the writing obligatory ha been brought, an was pening in his name for their use an benefit. Upon emurrer sustaine to this replication, jugment went against the plaintiff, from which, he appeale to this court, by whose ecision that jugment was reverse, an the cause remane: that such further proceeings were ha: that, at August term 1844, the plaintiff obtaine a rule against the efenant to file a bill of particulars of his set-off, an at February term, 1845, the efenant applie for leave to file an amene plea of accor an satisfaction, but there being no answer to the replication to the plea puis arrien continuance, on the plaintiff’s motion, the court entere final jugment against the efenant for want of a plea, that the plaintiff recover his ebt specifie in the writing obligatory with amages an costs of suit.
The complainant represents that when the plea puis arrien continuance was file, the attorney whom he ha originally retaine, was not in attenance upon the court, an he reluctantly yiele to the avice of the attorneys, then conucting his efence, to interpose such plea, whereby, as it turne out, he lost the benefit of his other efences, such plea being hel a'waiver of the previous pleas on file in the cause; whereas he alleges those pleas were true, an that he coul then an yet establish the same by proof; an procees to claim the benefit of such efences, which are again set up in the bill. He represents that the allege transfer of the writing obligatory, sue for at law, to Pope an Byers, was a mere pretence an without consieration. The bill prays for iscovery, an for an account of the ealings between the complainant an Hynson, an that he an the other efenants be enjoine from having execution of the jugment at lawi The bill is not sworn to, an no injunction was ever grante.
Hynson answere, enying all the material allegations in the bill; he exhibite the account current, in settlement of which the complainant ha execute the writing obligatory in question! As to- the house an lot, he represente the facts to the effect that the complainant ha bought the lot in the name of his son Philip, who gave his notes for the purchase money, an obtaine a bon for title. That complainant went on to improve the lot; but that he, the efenant, in fact mae the improvements an built the house referre to, an that with the exception of an inconsierable sum pai by the complainant, he ha avance all the money to pay for the work an materials, an for which he prouce the vouchers: that after a time, an with the consent of the complainant, he sol the house an lot, an of the procees a part was applie to the payment of the original purchase money of the lot, a part was receive by Philip Burton, an the resiue went to pay certain ebts of the efenant, but the amount receive by him was not more than sufficient to re-imburse -what he ha expene upon the builings, an the sale of the house an lot ha no connection with the writing obligatory in question, an was not any payment or extinguishment of it. He answere that he ha transferre the writing obligatory to. Pope an Byers in goo faith, an in payment of certain ebts which he owe them.
The answer of Byers set out the transaction attening the transfer by Hynson of the complainant’s obligation to Pope an himself, an avers that it was absolute an bonafie in payment of ebts which Hynson owe them.
Walker, the aministrator of Pope, answere, that he ha no personal knowlege of the matters in controversy, but claime the benefit of the jugment at law, upon his information that the writing obligatory sue upon ha been transferre to his intestate an William Byers.
The efenants, Byers an Hynson, insiste that the complainant was not entitle to relief in chancery, in respect of the matters set up in the bill, because he might have availe himself of the same matters in efence of the suit at law, an they relie on this objection by way of answer to the bill.
The cause was hear upon the pleaings an epositions on file, an a final ecree entere ismissing the bill.
We are clearly of opinion that the complainant, upon the allegations containe in the bill, is not entitle to be relieve in chancery against the jugment at law. In the case of Hempstea an Conway vs. Watkins, 1 Eng. 317, where this subject is much iscusse, the principle ecie is this: that wherever chancery anciently ha jurisiction, it is not ouste of it, because courts of law have assume jurisiction of any of those subjects, so as to affor relief in like cases ; an that in such cases the efenant is not boun to efen at law (as he woul be when the efence is purely legal) but he may elect not to efen at law, suffer jugment there an then make his efence in a court of chancery, to be relieve against the jugment. We are not calle upon now to question the correctness of that ecision, or to enquire what results it woul lea to, if the principle there asserte be carrie out in all its consequences. But that case concees an it is no where oubte, that if a efenant, sue at law, make efence there, though of an equitable character, if it be such as courts of law at this ay take cognizance of, he is consiere as electing to efen at law, is hel to that election, an cannot afterwars seek relief in chancery in respeet of the same matters; unless inee, he be prevente from making his efence by reason of some unavoiable accient, ignorance of fact, surprise or frau, an then he is amitte to obtain relief in chancery, sometimes in the shape of a bill for new trial, without regar to whether the efence, of which he was so eprive without any fault or neglect of his, be of a legal or equitable character.
Amitting therefore, that the plea of set-off comes within the case of Hempstea an Conway vs. Watkins, as being a efence of which courts of equity anciently ha cognizance, the complainant, by pleaing it at law, is preclue from availing himself of that efence in chancery, in orer to be relieve against the jugment at law, an the case then goes farther, holing that if the efenant make any efence at law, he is boun to make his whole efence there; that is, every matter of efence of which he coul have availe himself in a court of law.
Neither coul the complainant come into chancery upon the groun that the accor an satisfaction set up was not available to him at law. An this for several reasons. It is the same matter as that pleae by way of set off, an relie on as, in effect, a payment. Whether the plea was well or ill pleae, an whether the emurrer was properly sustaine, we will not en-quire. Enough appears on the face of the plea an the allegations of the bill, to show that the allege accor an satisfaction oes not come within the ecision in Levy vs. Very, 7 Eng. 148, which is not to be extene beyon the point actually ecie that at law an executory contract uner seal,is notsatisfie by the acceptance of an executory promise not uner seal, to perform the same ebt or uty, even though the consieration be the present payment of part of the ebt, an the shortening of the time, by the terms of the parol promise, for the payment of the resiue. The efence here was an accor fully execute by the acceptance of property in satisfaction of a ebt ue. The complainant oes not claim any right to relief in equity, because this efence was not cognizable at law, but claims to be relieve because he was eprive of the benefit of it by the effect of the plea puis arrien continuance.
The law of the case, as to the complainant’s legal rights, is settle by the ecisions of this court in Hynson vs. Burton, 5 Ark. 492, an Burton vs. Hynson, 1 Eng. 502. The excuse for coming into chancery is, that the complainant’s attorneys, who conucte his efence to the original suit at law in the Circuit Court, either through ignorance or esign, manage the case unskilfully. There woul be no en of litigation an no security in the ue enforcement of contracts, if the solemn jugment of a court of competent jurisiction coul be set asie, or the successful party restraine from executing it, upon grouns which o not imply any fault in the party obtaining the jugment, nor any error of the court in renering it.
But in truth the allegations of the bill as to the absence of the counsel on whom the complainant relie, an the want of skill in those who conucte his efence to the suit at law, are wholly unsustaine by proof. An so, although in our opinion, the bill was rightly ismisse at the hearing for want of jurisiction, we think there woul be no goo reason, upon a careful examination of the testimony, to oubt the correctness of the ecree upon the merits.
The ecree will be affirme.

1862610,Fenno vs. Coulter,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker
elivere the opinion of the Court.
George C. Watkins, as the assignee of Royster, obtaine jugment against James'an Richar Coulter, an sue out execution thereon, which was levie on property of the efenant, but which, for want of time, was not sol. Without having ispose of this levy, the plaintiff sue out an alias ji.fa. which was levie, as appears by the return on the writ, on the west half of the south-west quarter of section twenty-eight, an the south-west quarter of section twenty-nine, all in township two north, range eleven west; which were appraise uner the statute an offere for sale, but was not sol, because it faile to bring two-thirs of its appraise value. On the 2 of May, 1843, an after the eath of James Coulter, a writ of ven. ex., issue, escribing the lan irecte to be sol, accoring to the return of the sheriff on the ji. fa. Uner, an in obeience to this writ of ven. ex., the sheriff avertise an sol the lan therein escribe, to Fenno, who was the highest bier, for the price of $357 ; which sum he pai: an thereupon the sheriff execute to Fenno’ a ee, not for the south-west quarter, sec. 29, as escribe in the levy an writ of ven. ex., but the south-east quarter of sai section, which was the property of sai Coulter. The complainant claims title as sole heir of Coulter, alleges that the sale was voi, but that the ee being of recor, tens to cast suspicion on her title, an prays that the ee may be cancelle an given up. It appears from the evience that the sheriff knew where Coulter live; but i not know the numbers of the lan, an took them from his tax book without going upon the lan, or taking any steps to ascertain the lan, which in point of fact, belonge to Coulter. The numbers in the tax book, the return on the Ji. fa., the numbers in the ven, ex., an the avertisement, all escribe it as the south-west quarter. At the sale, the sheriff was informe that he ha mistaken the numbers of the lan, he replie that he ha not time then to examine, but that he was selling the Coulter place. Fenno was present at the time, an must be presume to have hear what was sai.
Fenno contens that in point of fact', the sheriff i levy on the Coulter lan, but by mistake, returne a ifferent tract as levie upon. This may, in some instances, be the case, as where the sheriff, after having ascertaine an set apart the property of the efenant, by mistake, returns a ifferent tract from that so ascertaine; or he may have suppose certain lans tobe the property of the efenant, an returne them as levie upon. In the first instance there woul be a levy on the property of the efenant, but a mistake in making the entry on his return. In the secon, there woul' be an intention to levy on the lan of the efenant, but by mistake, a levy on' other lans, not the efenant’s. In the first the mistake woul consist in the entry upon the writ; in the secon, in having mistaken the property of a thir person for that of the efenant.
One of the first steps towars a levy is to ascertain anientify the property of the efenant, so as to istinguish it from other property, an then to estimate in value, what will be sufficient to satisfy the execution. When this is one (where the property is lan) the levy is complete, an may be entere on his writ. It is not inispensably necessary to the valiity of a levy on lan that the sheriff shoul actually go upon it. He cannot take it into possession. But he must istinguish it as the property of the efenant, an in the exercise of a soun iscretion, set apart the property intene to be sol; he may then mistake in making his return of levy upon the writ, but until then, it is no mistake in recoring his return, but a mistake as to the lan that belonge to the efenant. There can be no mistake in oing what one intens to o. When we seek to ascertain the value of lan we must usally go upon it an examine it. But when we seek to ascertain the ownership, we usually look to the recor evience of title : the lan is there escribe most usually in the new States by numbers. We o not mean that it becomes the officer to trace out the title. The valiity of the title is not a matter for him to enquire into. It is true that possession may, an frequently oes ai in ientifying real estate, but a mere possessory title is not subject to sale ; inee, we o often all erive much benefit in ascertaining the ownership of lan by mere possession. In orer to convey lan, it must be escribe by its true numbers, or other efinite escription. The sale oes not take place upon the lan : it is not exhibite to the purchaser for inspection; he buys it by its escription, an takes his ee accoringly. If this was personal property, where possession is'the usual evience of title, less certainty in escription might be require, yet as far as the fact of an actual levy on the ientical property of the efenant is concerne, the principle is the same. If a sheriff shoul levy on one of several horses, in the efenant’s possession, an that levie upon shoul prove not to be his property, although the sheriff believe, at the time of the levy, that he was levying upon the property of the efenant, an shoul return accoringly, it coul not be sai that he levie on the efenant’s property, because he thought it his at the time. The fact that personal property; when levie upon, may be taken into possession by the officer, which is not the case in regar to lan, oes not affect the question of levy. It is not essential in either case to the valiity of the levy, that the property levie upon shoul be taken into possession. From all the circumstances of this case, we think there was no mistake in making an entry upon the writ of the property levie upon, but a mistake in levying upon the property of a thir person as the efenant’s..
But even if wrong in this, the south-west quarter, which was not the property of Coulter, was escribe in the ven. ex., an the sheriff commane to sell the lan therein escribe. A ven. ex. confers no power upon the officer to levy .upon lan, but simply to expose to sale the lans in the writ escribe. Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe et al. 7 Eng. 556. If the sheriff shoul be permitte to transcen his authority an power, so far as to sell the south-east quarter, uner a writ commaning him to sell the south-west quarter, where will be the limit to his power? Iiow many tracts may he sell ? The same rule which woul authorize the sale of an ajoining tract, woul justify a sale of one more istant, or any number as well as one. It may be sai that the sheriff knew that there was a mistake in the entry of his return, an that the south-east quarter was that, which in fact, was levie upon. Concee it to be true that such was the fact, an the sheriff knew it, shall we say that the sheriff may abanon the comman of his writ, an sell olher lan, because he knew of his personal knowlege that they were the lans really intene to be sol? But put it on a still stronger groun in his favor, an say the levy on the fi. fa., was correct, an that the mistake was alone in the ven. ex., shall he be permitte to isregar the comman of his writ, commaning him to expose certain-lans to sale, an expose other? We think not: an for a still stronger reason he coul not, in legal effect, amen a sheriff’s return. This coul only be one by leave of court; an .as Coulter ie before the writ of ven. ex., issue, an amenment coul not have been mae, even by the court, until new parties were brought before it. Uner this state of case, even amitting the first writ to have been levie, the sale uner the ven. ex., of the south-east quarter, was voi, for want of power in the officer to sell. But when taken in connection with the fact that there was no levy, no writ authorizing the sale, no avertisement of the property, an the whole proceeing ha after a levy ha been mae, an which remaine unischarge, it is rarely that a sale will be foun so utterly estitute of authority in the officer to sell. There is no contest between the parties as to the other tract ""sol.
The prayer of the complainant is, that the sheriff’s ee, uner which Fenno claime the lan, may be cancele an set asie, so far as it purports, or is intene to convey title to the southeast quarter of section 29, an for general relief. We are of opinion that this relief shoul be grante, but upon terms. It is a maxim, that he who seeks equity must o equity. Uner all the circumstances of the case, it woul not be right to set asie an vacate a part of the sale to Fenno, without renering some remuneration to him for the money which he pai to Coulter on a ebt which is amitte to be just; an whether the whole amount, or what amount shoul be refune, cannot, uner the present state of the pleaings, be ascertaine, for the amount to which he is entitle must epen on the proportion in value, which the lan, which he still hols uner his purchase, bears to the whole purchase with interest, against which it is but just that a like account of rents an profits shoul be taken against Fen-no, if (as appears from the evience) he has been in possession since his purchase. The complainant has not presente in his bill a state of case which woul allow proof upon these points, an we cannot oubt but that before the prayer of the complainant’s bill shoul be allowe, a just remuneration shoul be renere to Fenno for any sum of money he may have, in goo faith pai. The complainant was clearly not entitle to the relief sought, until it was shown that the money pai by the efenant for the lan, an which ha been applie to the liquiation of Coulter’s ebt ha been pai or tenere.
At the calling of the case for hearing, ha the complainant aske leave to amen her bill in this respect, it woul have been iscretionary with the court to have allowe, such amenment or not. No offer to amen was mae, an on the state of case presente the' court erre in ecreeing that the ee shoul have been given up, an cancele; but shoul have ecree against the prayer of the bill.
We must therefore set asie the ecree, an reman the case to the court below. In oing so a question of practice arises in regar to the instructions to be given to that court when the case is sent back for its farther action. Shall we allow the complainant to amen her bill, so as to allow an account to be taken as to the sum really ue to the efenant, an to which he is in goo faith equitably entitle, or shall we irect that the suit be ismisse without prejuice to the rights of the parties ? We have, in several instances, pursue the latter course, an as the .facts of this case are materially ifferent from those heretofore presente, we have again looke into the authorities, an upon examination of the cases, which we have heretofore ecie, we fin that in each of them an amenment woul, in effect, have been the institution of a new suit, upon a istinct an inepenant claim or right. For instance; in Cook vs. Bronaugh, 8 Eng. 188, the bill was for the specific execution of a contract, but it appeare that he might have asserte a claim for professional services, which were the consieration on which the special contract was base. The court refuse to sen the case back to the coui’t below, with leave to amen, because it woul have been no amenment of a cause of action efectively state, but the substitution of a new an ifferent cause of action. An so, also, in the case of Mauling vs. Scott et al. 8 Eng. 93. The bill set up title in the complainants to slaves, as heirs of the mother, who, it appeare upon the trial, ha no title, but that the complainants ha title as heirs of the father. The court refuse to irect an amenment, because it woul not be an amenment of a case efectively state, but the statement of a new an inepenent title.
The amenment, in the case before us, if allowe, woul not be the substitution of a new right or claim, but the amenment of the original right, or claim to relief by an aitional averment, so as to entitle her to relief upon her original cause of action.
When the case is sent back to the court below reverse, it stans' just as it i' before trial, an the action of that court is as full an unrestricte as it was before the case was trie, only so far as our ecision an irection may limit an restrain its action. Shall we limit that iscretion in this case by irecting the ismissal of the case, with leave to file a new bill, or shall we permit an amenment to be mae. The facts are now before us, an we may return the case for amenment, trial or ismissal ; or we may return it with iscretionary power in the court below, to allow an amenment upon terms. The ifference between this case an those heretofore ecie, to which we have referre, is that an amenment in this case woul, in effect, be a continuation of the ol suit. The allegations, as far as they go, the issue an the proofs may stan, an with aitional allegations, an proof may entitle the complainant to the specific relief sought. In the cases heretofore ecie, it woul have been the substitution of a new cause for equitable relief, with which such proofs an pleaings woul have no connection, an woul have been of no possible use.
Amenments are allowable in the iscretion of the courts, an usually upon terms of costs. If the complainant, as she has the parties an with allegations an proof, which may avail her in the further prosecution of the case, prefers to pay the costs which accrue in the case, up to an incluing the trial in the court below, an amen her bill, so as to entitle her to the relief sought, we think she shoul be permitte to o so, or shoul she ecline to o this, that her bill shoul be ismisse without prejuice.
Let the ecree of the Pulaski Court in Chancery, be set asie an reverse, an the cause remane to be proceee with accoring to law an not inconsistent with this opinion.

This case comes up by appeal from the Washington Circuit Court. The recor shows that Perkins, a citizen of the State of Missouri, file his bill of complaint, an sue out process of subpoena, an a writ of injunction without having first file in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court, the obligation of a responsible person resiing in the State, acknowleging himself boun to pay all costs that might accrue in the suit, an that at the return term of such process the efenants file their plea in abatement, alleging the omission, an “ that the sai complainant was at, an before the filing sai bill of complaint, an the suing out from before the Clerk of sai Circuit Court, the sai writs, a resient citizen of the State of Missouri, an from thence hitherto, hath been an still is a citizen of sai State,” an praying jugment of ismissal, &c. This plea was verifie by the affiavit of one of the efenants. Afterwars, an before any action was taken upon the plea, the complainant presente an aske leave to file the bon of a resient citizen of the State of Arkansas, conitione to pay all the costs that might accrue, &c.; which bon was shown to be fully sufficient for that purpose; but the court refuse to permit the same to be file, an the plea being unanswere, entere a ecree for the ismissal of complainant’s bill, &c. It is insiste that the court below erre in refusing the bon for costs, an ismissing the bill.
The provisions of our statute bearing on the subject are, that “ in all suits in law or equitj^, where the plaintiff, or person for whose use the action is commence, shall not be a resient of this State, the plaintiff"", or person for whose use the action is about to be brought, shall, before he institutes such suit, file in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court, in which the action is to be commence, the obligation of some responsible person, being a resient of this State, by which he shall acknowlege himself boun to pay all costs which may accrue in such action,” an further, “If any such action shall be commence without filing such obligation, the Circuit Court shall on motion ismiss the same,” &c. See Digest page 280, sec. 1 an 2.
Although the statute is in its phraseology, imperative, the exercise of a soun iscretion by the Circuit Court, in cases analogous to the one uner consieration, has heretofore been recognize in furtherance of justice, see Town vs. Evans, 6 Eng. 10. Ib. Moglin & wife vs. Slay, 696. The provision of the statute being express, an this court having heretofore gone no further than to recognize the exercise of a soun iscretion by the Circuit Court in such cases, we o not regar the present as an open question. Let the jugment of the court below below be affirme with costs.

The case here is, that the Bank exhibite her petition, uner .the statute, against the appellant, alleging, that he, being inebte to her by note, in orer to secure the payment of the same, execute his ee of mortgage to her of certain horses, an also of a tract of lan, that the mortgage was uly acknowlege an recore, an that consistently with its stipulations, the efenant Price, ha continue in possession of the mortgage property real an personal; that the ebt remaine wholly unpai, an the conition of the ee ha become forfeit: an praying jugment for the amount of the ebt, with interest specifie in the note an secure by the mortgage; that the efenant’s equity of reemption in the mortgage property might be foreclose, an the property ecree to be sol, an the procees applie to the payment of the ebt.
Price answere, amitting the inebteness, an that he execute the mortgage, as allege, in goo faith, to secure the same; but that since its execution, the horses in question ha ie from isease while in his possession, without any fault or neglect of his; an that previous to the execution of the mortgage, one Charles Lewis ha obtaine a jugment against him, in the Circuit Court of the Unite States, for the Arkansas District, which was a lien upon the real estate escribe in the mortgage, an of which he was not aware at the time he execute it; that since then one Louis Refel ha become the purchaser, an was in possession of the lan uner execution ha of the jugment in the Feeral Court, an submitting that Refel was a necessary party to the suit.
The complainant then exhibite an amenment to her bill, against Price an Refel, alleging that Refel’s purchase was a sham, an collusive; that Refel ha bought the lan with the money of Price, or hel it by some secret agreement in trust for him. To this, the efenants answere, enying the frau an combination charge; averring that the purchase by Refel was in all respects fair an not colorable. Refel set out his title uner the Marshal’s sale, by virtue of which he ha obtaine control of the lan, an relie on his title as a efence to the bill.
At the hearing, upon bill, answer, replication an exhibits, it appearing that Refel hel the lan by title superior to the mortgage, the bill was ismisse as to him; an because of the estruction of the personal property, no ecree of foreclosure coul be renere; but the court ecree against the efenant, Price, that the complainant recover of him the amount of the ebt an interest intene to be secure by the mortgage, an which remaine unpai.
Upon the appeal of Price from this ecree, it is contene for him, that the statutory remey for foreclosure, if aopte, must be strictly pursue; an that whenever it appeare uring the progress of the suit, that foreclosure coul not be ecree because of the estruction of the personal property, an the failure of the mortgagor’s title to the realty, the bill shoul have been ismisse for want of jurisiction, the complainant for the mere recovery of her ebt having a plain an aequate remey at law.
Upon the reaing of the statute, Digest, Title, Mortgages, it woul seem ifficult to etermine whether the framers of it intene the proceeing to foreclose mortgages shoul be ha in a court of law or a court of chancery. Yet we think, as hel in McLain & Bagett vs. Smith, 4 Ark. 246, that it is essentially a chancery proceeing, because, as now constitute, a court of chancery can, an a court of law cannot give effect to all the remeies contemplate by it. Without making any question whether the legislature, uner the constitution, can eprive chancery of any of its peculiar jurisiction, see Hempstea an Conway vs. Watkins, 1 Eng. 357, or may not invest courts of law with chan-/ eery powers, the present statute oes not inten to o either, but rather to enlarge the jurisiction of chancery.
The substantial provisions of the statute are, that mortgagees of real or personal estate, may procee by petition in the Circuit Court, against the mortgagor, an the actual occupiers of any of the real estate, setting out the mortgage, praying that jugment may be renere for the ebt, an that the equity of reemption may be foreclose, an that the mortgage property may be sol to satisfy the amount ue. All persons claiming an interest in the mortgage property may be mae efenants, an may plea any lawful matter in avoiance of the ee or ebt. If upon trial, the mortgage money appears to be unpai, the court is to rener jugment for the ebt, interest an costs, an make an orer that the specific mortgage property be sol, or so much as will be sufficient to satisfy the amount ue. Upon this jugment or ecree, a special writ of fieri facias issues escribing the property, an commaning that it be sol to satisfy the mortgage ebtso ajuge. The mortgagor has, in all cases, until the ay of sale uner the execution to reeem the mortgage premises, by paying the amount ue. The jugment or ecree, as in other cases, is a general lien from its renition upon the real estate of the mortgagor. If, upon the return of the special fieri facias, it appears that the mortgage property faile to prouce satisfaction of the ebt, an execution may issue for the resiue as on orinary jugments.
This statute, so far from afforing a harsh remey an to be strictly construe, as one in erogation of the common law, ought to be favore an liberally construe: because it affors a remey at once simple an comprehensive, efficacious for the mortgagee, an equitable for the mortgagor.
The statute oes not take away, but its policy is to iscourage, in practice, the common law right of the mortgagee to bring his action at law for the ebt. Because, if the mortgagee obtains an inepenent jugment at law, the result might be exceeingly harsh an oppressive, if he be allowe to subject the estate of the ebtor to the “sweeping esolation of an execution at law,” without exhausting the mortgage property, which the one ha given an the other accepte as security for the ebt. So, if the execution be levie on the mortgage property, the question woul arise whether the sale bars the equity of reemption, or whether the purchaser acquires the property ischarge from or subject to the-mortgage; either way, the property is sol uner the clou of the subsisting mortgage, an a oor is open for the commission of fraus to evae a sacrifice of property. Although the common law octrine of strict foreclosure is unknown to our law, or never resorte to in practice, yet the effect might be the same if the mortgagee can become the purchaser of the equity of reemption, uner his jugment at law for the mortgage ebt, an so unite in himself the equitable an the legal estate.
But the statute carries out all the liberal notions of the law oí mortgages entertaine at the present ay. The mortgagor has the benefit of a fair public sale of the mortgage premises, with assurance to the purchaser of a clear title, all the parties in interest having been before the court. The mortgagee has the benefit of the general lien of his jugment or ecree for tbe ebt, an, if this be not satisfie by the sale of the mortgage property, he can at once sue out an orinary execution for the resiue, without being remitte to a court of law, to complete his remey by obtaining a jugment in personam against the mortgagor for such resiue.
In McLain & Bagett vs. Smith, the matter ecie was, thatii it be mae to appear that there is a tenant in possession, not a party, the court will require him to be mae a efenant, an or. failure of the complainant to comply with the orer, will ismiss the bill. Apart from the statute, the same rule of ecision will apply to all other persons intereste in the subject of the litigation, if susceptible of being mae parties.
The report of the case of Jett vs. Cave & Schaffer, 5 Ark. 244, is, that a ecree was entere up for the amount of the ebt an costs, an that the mortgage property be sol to satisfy it; an this court reverse the ecree, because it i not foreclose or bar the equity of reemption as praye for in the petition, an which was thought to be an inispensable requisite of the statute. We must conclue that the opinion in that case was not well consiere. It may be oubte whether the statute contemplates any formal ecree of foreclosure, in orer to bar the equity of reemption, (see sec. 13,) an if it oes, whether the ecree for the ebt, an for the sale of the property to satisfy it, is not a substantial compliance with the law. This point is much iscusse, though without reference to any such statutory provision in the case of Lansing vs. Goelet, 9 Cowen 347. An if the omission to enter a formal ecree of foreclosure be not a compliance with the statute,, it is ifficult to see how the mortgagor coul complain of it as erroneous. The ecision there eviently procees on the groun that the statute affors a remey to be strictly pursue. Our views of the statute are altogether ifferent. It is the only statute regulating the law of mortgages in this State. It is to be' apprehene that many unfortunate consequences woul follow, if without such a controling statute, we shoul have to fall back upon the common law an the statutes of Englan, prior to the fourth year of James the First, to etermine the rights growing, out of such contracts.
Conceing the general proposition contene for by the appellant, that the efenant in chancery may object for the want of jurisiction, because the complainant ha an aequate remey at law, by answer as well as by emurrer, an that the complainant may be turne out of court if the want of jurisiction appear from the proofs at the hearing, else the submission of the parties to the forum might operate as a frau upon the jurisiction; yet, it shoul be borne in min, that the evil to be guare against is not so much the resort to chancery in the first instance, for relief, which a court of law can as well an more expeitiously affor; but it is the increase of litigation, the vexation an elay of a resort to chancery, to be relieve against jugments at law, where the complainant might have availe himself of the same groun of efence.
But the objection taken by the appellant is not tenable upon what we conceive to be the proper construction of the statute,the esign of which is to confer upon chancery a jurisiction it ha not before, viz : that of renering a jugment in personam for the mortgage ebt, an of enforcing it as an orinary jugment at law, if not satisfie after exhausting the mortgage property by sale uner the ecree of foreclosure. True, the mortgagee connot go into chancery, an ask merely for a ecree or jugment for his ebt. But on the face of this bill an exhibits the court of chancery ha jurisiction to ecree foreclosure as well as to rener jugment for the ebt. Upon the suggestion of the appellant, the averse rights of a thir party were brought before the court, thus calling into exercise one of the peculiar powers of equity jurisiction. In orer to etermine that the complainant was not entitle to a ecree of foreclosure an sale of the realty as against Refel, it necessarily took cognizance of the cause an i ajuicate it. A court of chancery having jurisiction of a cause for one purpose, an having all the parties in interest before it, will o complete justice between them an en litigation by isposing of all the questions in the cause, though any of them separately be of legal cognizance.
Here the complainant was entitle to all the relief praye for as against the efenant Price, an woul have obtaine it but for bis own wrongful act. His objection that the court of chancery ecree only a pai of the rélief praye for against him, has been etermine without consiering it to be unconscionable.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The complainant file her bill against the heirs, an the aministrator of the estate of William Arnett, an against Ephraim Myrick an Sherian W. Williams, in which she alleges that she is the wiow of sai intestate, who ie seize an possesse of two slaves, Green an Ey, in whom she claims a ower interest! The heirs an aministrator o not contest the complainant’s right to ower; but Myrick an Williams, who have the slaves in possession, assert title to them as purchasers at juicial sale.
By an agree statement of the facts signe an entere of recor, it is amitte that the slaves were uly levie upon an taken into possession on the first of January, 1849, uner a vali execution against the intestate: that after the levy an before the return ay of the writ, on the 22 January, 1849, the intestate ie: that afterwars, at a regular sheriff’s sale, the efenants, Myrick an Williams, bought an pai for the slaves, an took them into possession. All other facts concee, the question of contest was whether the intestate was so seize an possesse of the slaves at the time of his eath as to entitle the wiow to ower. The court below ecie against her right to ower, an ismisse her bill. An in this she alleges there is error.
The statute, Dig. ch. 59, sec. 20, provies that, “ A wiow shall be entitle, as part of her ower, to one-thir part of the slaves, ■whereof her husban ie seize or possesse, uring her natural life, an one-thir part of the personal estate in her own right.” This section, unlike that which allows ower in real estate, limits the wife’s right to ower to the slaves of which the husban was, at the time of his eath, seize or possesse, an cuts off all claim to ower where the slaves have been ispose of prior to his eath, an this without her co-operation, or assent. The whole question then turns upon the effect of the levy, which, although insufficient to ivest the efenant in execution of title to the property levie upon, for that oes not pass until after sale, 'oes, when mae on personal estate, isseize the efenant an ispossess him of the property levie upon; for whether the officer takes the property into possession or not, it is, in contemplation of law, in his custoy; he is responsible for it, an has a right to hol it against the claims of the efenant in execution, an all others. It is taken in satisfaction of the ebt, an is hel an taken as such until sol, or the levy is otherwise ischarge. The levy, in this case, was not only a isseizin in law, but also in fact, for the property was not only actually taken out of his possession, but beyon the control of the efenant, or his power to reclaim or reuce it to possession by mere force of legal right.
The efenant in execution, therefore, ha not at the time of his eath, such seizin or possession as to entitle the complain ant to ower in the slaves, an consequently there was no error in the ecree of the court below.

elivere the opinion of the Courti
This suit was institute by attachment, in the Ranolph Circuit Court. The writ was irecte to the constable of Demeen Township, in Ranolph county, to be by him execute an returne. At the return term the plaintiff move to have the writ amene, so as to show accoring to the facts, that the reason why it was so irecte, was that the offices both of sheriff an' coroner of that county, were vacant at the time of its issuance; an at the same time, upon the groun of the omission of any such reason, the efenant move to quash the writ. The court overrule the motion to amen, an sustaine .the motion to quash.
The act of December 21st, 1846, provies that where the offices of sheriff an coroner of any county are both vacant, an so where there is no coroner, an the sheriff is intereste in the suit, it shall be the uty of any constable of the county, to whom process may be irecte, to execute an return it in the same manner as sheriffs an coroners are require by law to o.
This statute was esigne to facilitate the remey, by substituting another class of executive officers in the place of the sheriff or coroner, whose appropriate uty it is to execute process of the Circuit Courts, in particular cases when those offices are vacant, or the officers themselves are isqualifie; seeing that such vacancies or contingencies may happen, against which the laws cannot provie. The statute is not objectionable as tening to ispense with the office of sheriff or coroner, which the legislature coul not o, but is rather to be commene as an effort on the part of the legislature to guar against any possible failure of justice, for want of the means appointe by law to attain that en.
On the other han, the averse party to be affecte by process issuing from the Circuit Court in civil cases, has the right to insist that such process shall be execute by its proper officer; because he is presume to be a man of substance, personally responsible for his tortious acts, is uner the immeiate control of the court, an whose official bon, in cases where the securities are liable for his acts of commission or omission, furnishes ample inemnity against any abuse of the powers confie to him. An as the authority of the constable to act in the stea of the sheriff, is a special one an limite to the particular case, resting solely on the groun that there is no sheriff or coroner in commission, or none qualifie to act, the fact of such vacancy, or isqualification ought to be suggeste an recite in the writ, which then becomes the officer’s warrant, an a notification to the efenant of his authorityJ;o execute it; an it may well be pleae in abatement of the process that such suggestion or recital is untrue in fact.
But the omission of such recital oes not make voi the writ, which is, in legal contemplation, issue out of the court, presume to know who are its officers; an whenever the power to issue such special process is concee, no goo reason is perceive why it oes not come within the beneficial operation of the statute of amenments. We cannot suppose that the allowance of the amenment, propose to be mae in this case, accoring to the truth of the matter, coul operate to the surprise or injury of the efenant, or eprive him of any substantial right affecting the merits of the suit. On the contrary, its allowance woul conuce to the furtherance of justice. It is fair to presume that if the efenant is injure, it is by the want of authority in the constable to act, an not by means of the omission of the evience of that authority. Accoring to the opinion in Mitchell vs. Conley, at January term, 1853, we conclue that the iscretion of the court in refusing to allow the amenment was not rightly exercise, an for that reason the jugment ought to be reverse, an the cause remane for further proceeings, accoring to law an not inconsistent with this opinion.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
In February, 1845, the intestate, Spears, exhibite his bill against Taylor, alleging that in the year 1834, they forme a partnership in a saw mill, an that in the year 1836, they also entere into a mercantile partnership in Jefferson county. That the partnership in the mill was issolve some time in the summer of 1837, an that the mercantile partnership was continue until about the month of January, 1839. That profits were realize from both the concerns, which were woun up by Taylor, who ha charge of the books an receive the avails. The bill praye iscovery an account, an a ecree for the balance ascertaine to be ue to the complainant.
Taylor answere, that there was a partnership in two saw mills, one in a water mill commencing in 1834, an the other in a steam mill. That the steam mill was put into operation about the first of January, 1836, an some time uring the spring of the same year the water mill was washe away. That there was also a partnership in a store, which continue from some time in the year 1836 until August, 1837. That no profits were realize from either business, of which he exhibite accounts. That he ha pai ebts of the concerns beyon what assets he ha receive. That he was always reay an willing to settle, but complainant ha left the State, an it was his own fault that there ha been no settlement. He set up by way of answer the statute of limitations of three years as a bar to the relief.
Subsequently, Taylor file a cross bill re-asserting his answer with an enlarge statement of the business of the several partnerships, an of other transactionsbetween Spears anhimself, claiming a balance ue to him by Spears, on a full settlement, praying an account an ecree. Among the unsettle matters between them, he represente that, as the agent of Spears, who ha left the country, he sol a tract of lan belonging to Spears, an for the procees of which, he ha given him creit on account of what Spears owe him. That Spears, who was insolvent, ha recovere jugment against him on the law sie of the court, for the procees of the lan in question; an he praye that this jugment might be enjoine an brought into the account to be state between them.
Spears answere, amitting the partnerships in the two mills an the store. He again gave his own version of the partnership transactions. He enie that he was insolvent. He insiste that the transaction about the sale of the lan ha no connection with the partnership business. An as to some items charge against him by Taylor, an which he allege were transactions outsie of the partnerships, he relie in his answer on the statute of limitations. He answere, that his action against Taylor to recover the procees of the lan was pening, an no jugment ha then been renere in it.
The two suits being at issue, by replications to the answers, both parties proceee to take epositions! At a subsequent term, the court orere that Spears esist from proceeing to execute the jugment at law, which he ha in the meantime obtaine against Taylor; an the master in chancery was irecte to take an state an account of the matters in ispute between the parties. Aitional epositions were taken before the master, an upon the coming in of his report, it was excepte to by Spears upon various grouns. At a subsequent term the eath of Spears being suggeste, his aministrator was substitute, an the cause was submitte upon the exceptions to the master’s report. The court being of opinion that neither party was entitle to any relief, ismisse the original an cross bill at the costs of the respective complainants, from which ecree both parties appeale.
Such is a brief outline of the voluminous recor of this cause ; the etails of which are not material to the etermination of the question, which we unerstan to be involve in the cause, an the only one upon which we can suppose the ecision of the court below to have turne.
In Tatam vs. Williams, 3 Hare, 347, ecie in 1844, an the latest English case we meet with on this subject, the bill of a surviving partner seeking an account of partnership transactions, brought thirteen years after issolution by eath of one of the partners, was ismisse on the groun of lapse of time. The ¡Yíce Chancellor sai, “ In this court there is irect an very high authority for the proposition that a court of equity will not, after six years acquiescence, unexplaine by circumstances, or countervaile by acknowlegment, ecree an account between a surviving partner, an the estate of a ecease partner,” citing Barber vs. Barber, 18 Vesey 286. Ault vs. Goorich, 4 Russell 430, an Briges vs. Mitchell, Gilbert's Eq. Rep. 224, an those cases were ahere to, notwithstaning the remarks of Lor Brougham an the apparent grouns of the ecision by the House of Lors in the case of Robinson vs. Alexaner, 8 Bligh 352.
It is to be collecte from the case of Ray vs. Bogart, 2 John. Cases 432, that, assuming eleven years as the perio of elay unaccounte for, after issolution of a partnership, a bill seeking an examination an settlement of the accounts will be ismisse where the statute of limitations is not pleae or insiste on in the answer, though Juge Kent, who iffere from a majority of the court of errors, oubte whether the statute of limitations applies where there is a mutual trust as between partners, an if it i, he thought the efence is waive unless insiste on.
The circumstance that the estate of a ecease partner is sought to be charge is one that may often influence a court of chancery in refusing reief, so far as that may epen upon iscretion, because of the suppose inability of the representatives of the ecease partner, to conten on equal terms with the survivor san the statute of the State limiting claims against the estates of ecease persons, unless presente for probate an allowance within two years from the grant of letters, woul no oubt have a material bearing upon cases of that escription, where the statute of limitation has any application in chancery. But the ecisions are not confine to cases where either of the partners ha ecease. Where the statute applies in chancery, the enial of the relief oes not epen on that circumstance. In Diier vs. Davison, 2 Barbour Chy. Rep. 482, this subject was consiere, an upon the strength of the previous ajuge cases in New York, relief was enie on a bill for account, where there ha been no ealings within six years, an the complainant an efenant were in full life. The case there was embarrasse by the exception in the statute of accounts between merchant an merchant. The statute of this State, in force 20th March, 1839, oes not retain this exception, but enacts in lieu of it, that in all cases of mutual ealings, the statute runs from the last item prove; an it seems to be settle in Englan, as well as in this country, that the accounts between partners respecting the profits or transactions of the firm, are not hel to be within the saving in favor of accounts between merchant an merchant, where that exception exists.
In express trusts, where one hols the legal title an another has the beneficial interest, an which, as between the trustee an ■cestui que trust are recognizable only in a court of equity, so long-as the trust create by the ee of the parties or the appointment of law, is recognize to exist, an for any purpose remains to be execute, the statute of limitations, as such, or the analogous bar by lapse of time or staleness of the eman can have no application. But implie trusts often epening on parol proof, which have to be establishe as well as enforce by the ai of a court of equity, an originating in some wrongful an frauulent act of the party sought to be charge as trustee, which is a isavowal oí the relation, o come within the reason an policy of the statute. In such cases the party seeking to establish the trust, is suppose to have some remey, though not an aequate one at law, against the trustee committing the wrongful act or conversion, upon which the law raises the trust by implication; an where the party seeking reress is apprise of his rights, or if they be frauulently conceale from him, whenever the frau is iscovere, or might reasonably have become known, he must assert his rights in equity within the perio limiting the analogous remey at law, unless he come within some saving or exception. Else by merely going into another forum, he coul evae the policy of the statute limiting actions atlaw. Conceing then that there is a quasi trust or confience in the ealings between partners, it is not that kin of technical trust cognizable only in equity, an which exclues the operation of the statute. With equal reason such a claim to exemption from the statute coul be mae in all cases of bailment, agency an the various confiential relations in the transaction of business. Such is recognize to be the law in this country in numerous cases, among which, the leaing one is that of Kane vs. Bloogoo, 7 John. Chy. 89, an the authorities will be foun collecte on the subject in Murray's amr. vs. Mason's amr. 8 Porter 211. See also Baker vs. Bile, Balwin's Rep. 418.
In this case the partnerships were issolve by the abanonment of Spears in 1837. It oes not appear that any settlement was attempte or that either party sought it. No circumstance of accient, frau or concealment is allege, which woul now entitle the parties to the favor of equity. The bills are purely for an account an for iscovery in ai of it. The bulk of the business was transacte ten years before the filing of the bill, an there oes not appear to have been any transaction within eight years. Then recurring to the statute which limits all actions of accounts, assumpsit, or ebt upon contracts not in writing, to three years; actions on promissory notes an contracts in writing not uner seal, to five years; upon writings obligatory an j ugments to ten years; an the statute of non-claim against estates before averte to, the policy which pervaes it is sufficiently inicate; an where the statute applies courts of equity accoring to these rules, as well as courts of law ought to aminister it. The case of McGuire vs. Ramsay, 4 Eng. 518, oes not necessarily conflict with the point actually ecie'here, that the relation between co-partners oes not create such a trust as will exempt a bill for a mere account an settlement, from the operation of the statute, but it maybe oubte whether that case i not go a great way in establishing an implie trust after lapse of time.
For the same reasons that a efenant in chancery is not require in all cases to avail himself of the efence of limitation, by way of answer or by plea, as at law, but may emur where a efence, which the complainant by his allegations has anticipate without avoiing, appears to exist on the face of the bill, the objection that the claim is a stale one may be taken at the hearing, an when the proofs isclose such a case, the court may of its own motion eny relief to parties who have slept upon their rights; because while courts of chancery may have a iscretion to etermine the rights of parties seeking an ajuication, notwithstaning the lapse of time where the facts are not ispute or susceptible of being clearly ascertaine; the reason why they refuse relief in accorance with a statute by which they are not expressly boun, is the fear of oing injustice, an the inability to affor relief, where the sources of testimony have become obscure or lost by lapse of time.
The present case is peculiarly one of that escription. The bar of the statute set up by Taylor in his answer, must be consiere as waive by his cross bill, which eprive Spears of any election to ismiss the bill, an the court was free to settle the controversy between the parties, if the proofs gave assurance that it coul be one with any egree of certainty or safety. But it appears that all the partnerships were mere parol agreements an as to the very terms an stipulations of which at the outset the answers of the parties themselves raically an irreconcilably.- In the two mills an the store, Taylor was in partnership with ifferent persons, an Spears was let in as a sort of sub-partner with Taylor in his half interest in these concerns. No regular books of account were kept, an of such as were kept some are lost. The master i not attempt to take any account of the mercantile transactions. The mill accounts are complicate by the loss of rafts an isputes between the parties concerning receipts for lumber an isbursements for expenses, an for the hire an support of hans; an epening for eluciation upon the uncertain testimony of witnesses, who as they are competent by having no interest in the transactions, ha no motive to unerstan or recollect them with accuracy.
If injustice has been one by turning both parties out of court, it is to be regrette only as the result of their own laches, an for the reason that it cannot be clearly known whether injustice has been one, we conclue that the chancellor in refusing relief to either party, was influence by just views of the law an his uty.

The appellant, who was the complainant below, exhibite his bill in chancery against John Waggoner, Emun P. Waggoner, Ewin T.

That if Burr pai, or agree to pay any thing as the consieration for the conveyance from Emun P. to him, it was solely for the benefit of John W., an that in obtaining such ee he ha collue with the other efenants to enable John W. to hiner an elay his creitors. That the jugment at law in the complainant’s favor remaining unsatisfie, on the 19th ay of June, 1845, he cause execution to be issue thereon, returnable to August term following, which was levie upon the lan in question as the property of the efenant, John W., which being uly avertise was expose to sale by the sheriff uner such execution, an the complainant became the purchaser, an the same was uly conveye to him by sheriff’s ee, ate, acknowlege, an recore on the 19th of August, 1845. That, afterwars, the complainant obtaine peaceable possession of the lan in controversy, an the efenant, Hooper, acting uner the authority of Burr, intrue himself into the possession, an withhel it from the complainant. A transcript of the jugment at law, execution an return, the ee from the sheriff to complainant, an copies of the ee an bill of sale from John W. to Emun P., an of the ee from Emun P. to the efenant, Burr, are mae exhibits to the bill, which prays that the conveyances from John W. to Emun P. an from him to Burr, be cancele as frauulent, that the possession of the lan be restore to the complainant, an his title thereto establishe an quiete, an for an account of the rents an profits against Burr an Hooper. A ecree pro confesso was taken against the Waggoners an Hooper, an the cause was hear on the bill an exhibits, the answer of Burr, replication an the epositions on file. The court below being of opinion that the complainant ha faile to show himself entitle to ""the relief praye, ismisse the bill.
Upon the facts prove, the frauulent character of the conveyance from John W. to Emun P. becomes transparent. The grantor was a man of family, involve in ebt beyon his means, ha been sue in a number of cases ; the grantee was his son, a young man without property, or creit, unless to a very limite extent, who was then living with his father, as a member of his family, an continue to live with him while he remaine in the country; the ee was absolute, but no apparent change of ownership took place in the property, an John W. continue in possession as before, from the time of the conveyance to his son, until he abanone the place subsequent to the purchase of it by Ringgol, uner execution. No money was pai, either for the lan or personal property, but it seems to have been the unerstaning that the sales were mae to Emun P. for the purpose of paying the ebts of John W. The ebts were not specifie; an it oes not appear that the grantee ever pai a cent. The ee for the lan acknowlege the receipt of the consieration* when it ha not been pai, an the grantor took no note or obligation for its payment. Besies these unmistakable bages of frau, which, before a court of chancery passing upon the facts proven, are conclusive as to the frauulent intent, there is proof of other circumstances, the cotemporaneous acts an eclarations of the parties to these conveyances, all conucing to show that their intention was to prevent the creitors of John W. from taking his property in execution ; an the inevitable effect of the whole transaction was to hiner an elay his creitors.
Such being the conclusion of fact, it follows that the conveyance from John W. to Emun P. as against the complainant, was voi, an the jugment, subsequently obtaine by him, became a lien upon the lan as the property an estate of the frauulent grantor, an the complainant, by his purchase of the lan uner execution, acquire a vali title to it as against the parties to the frauulent conveyance!
The only question in the case is whether the efenant, Burr, is entitle to be protecte as an innocent purchaser. Although the efence is informally set up, yet taking all the allegations of the answer together an in orer to arrive at what appears to be the merits of the cause, we shall make no question here whether the answer is sufficient to let in proof of every substantial fact necessary to- constitute Burr an innocent purchaser. But there are some other statements in the answer that are to be consiere in connection with the proof. Burr amits that after his purchase, an after the ee from Emun P. to him ha been file for recor, the complainant, Ringgol, notifie him that he ha a jugment against John W., which was a lien upon the lan in question, an he intene to have it sol uner it, an that the sale from John W. to Emun P. was frauulent an without consieration, &c., an he goes on to state that supposing what the complainant sai was true, an that the jugment spoken of was a lien, he tol the complainant that if such was the case, he woul not conten for the lan, an woul o nothing the law i not sustain him in. That in a ay or two afterwars, he saw Emun P. an informe him of what the complainant ha sai, when Emun P. earnestly enie all attempts or esign, to efrau the complainant, an gave a narrative of the transaction, which, it woul seem from the answer, was the first information Burr ha of it, an was, in substance, that the conveyances from his father to him were fair, an that he was to pay the ebts of his father as the consieration for them, that his father wishe to prefer other creitors to the complainant, whom he i not acknowlege as a creitor, an i not inten to pay him unless compelle to o so, because that ebt, or a large portion of it ha been pai, for which no creits ha been given! Burr states that he then took legal avice, an upon investigation became satisfie that the conveyance from John W. to Emun P. was fair, that the complainant’s jugment was not a lien, an etermine that ho woul eneavor to hol the lan uner his purchase from Emun P., an immeiately notifie the complainant that such was his intention. It must be inferre from the answer that the efenant means to say that all the information he ha of the character of the conveyance from John W. to Emun P., that the former was inebte, an that the latter ha no means, was obtaine after his purchase from Emun P. was complete. He states further, that he pai, as part of the consieration a ebt of Emun P. to the State Bank, at Batesville, of about $400 an to Emun P. about $280, an also transferre to him an account against his father for $60.
Numerous epositions on behalf of both parties were rea in the cause, an excluing all the evience that might have been objectionable, an regaring it in the most favorable light for the efenant, Burr, it oes incontestibly prove the following facts : That Burr mae two istinct contracts for the lan in question an took two conveyances for it from Emun P., within a few ays of each other. That the first contract an conveyance were cancele, an at Burr’s solicitation the money, about $40, which he ha pai to Emun P. on the purchase, was refune to him! That the reason why the first contract was so cancele was, that Bürr ha hear of Ringgol’s jugment against John W. an his claim upon the lan in consequence of the allege fraq, an ha become issatisfie with the purchase. That before he purchase ho was informe of Ringgol’s claim to the lan. That Emun P. ha not pai or assume any ebt for John W. in the ‘Bank: that Burr pai Emun P. $100 an not exceeing that sum; that he unertook to paya part of .the consieration by substituting his note in Bank for the inebteness of John W., an as the resiue of the consieration Emun P. took up the inebteness of John W. to Burr, amounting to about $300. That John W. was, an ha been for some time previous, notoriously insolvent; an that Emun P. was estitute of means, that John W. was all the while in possession of the lan an personal property, using it at his own; that all the parties live in the same vicinity, an that Burr ha full opportunity for being-apprise of all the circumstances material for him to know.
Leaving out of view the positive proof of notice brought home to Burr, by at least two witnesses, we shoul be force to the conclusion, from other circumstances in proof, that he ha sufficient notice to have put him upon enquiry as a man of orinary pruence an experience in business transactions; an when the means of information are affore to a party, he will not be allowe to protect himself by the want of notice, because he i not choose to be informe.
In a case involving no oubtful questions of law, an upon proofs apparently so plain we cannot hesitate to ecie that the ecree here appeale from is erroneous. The jugment of this court will be that the ecree be reverse, an the cause remane, with instructions to the Circuit Court to ecree in favor of the complainant, that the conveyance for the lan in controversy from John W. to Emun P. Waggoner, an the conveyance for the same from him to the efenant, Burr, are voi as against the complainant, an that the same be cancele; that the efenants surrener the posssession of the lan to the complainant, an that his title thereto be as against them confirme an quiete; that the efenants, Burr an Hooper, pay the complainant the value of the rents an profits of the lan from the time it is shown to be in their possession at any time after the complainant’s purchase of the same uner execution; an that the Circuit Court irect an account to be taken of such rents an profits, unless satisfie to ecree the same upon the proofs alreay taken.",legal_case

elivere the opinon of the court.
The estate of Daniel L. Jackson ecease, of which the appellant is aministrator, appears to be of the value of the aggregate sum. of about two thousan four hunre an seventy ollars, consisting of personal property, part of which has been sol, an the resiue elivere to the wiow, at the appraise value, as part of her ower — ebts ue the estate by bons an promissory notes, ebts ue by open account an some county scrip of the county of Monroe.
In an account current renere to the probate'court of that county, the aministrator charge himself with these several varieties of assets, an besies taking creit for expenitures, for which he prouce vouchers, eucte also a sum equal to ten per centum upon the entire actual value of the estate that came into his hans. The Probate court, upon examining the account an passing upon it, correcte it so far as to strike out the ten per centum as eucte an to allow five per centum. To that action of the court, the aministrator excepte by his bill an appeale regularly to the Circuit Court of Monroe county, where the oings of the Probate court in the premises were affirme, an he has now brought his case into this court by appeal.
The appellant contens that the statute regulating the allowance of commissions to aministrators, by way of compensation for their risk an trouble, (Dig. chap. 4 sec. 108,p. 130) is applicable only to the collection of claims in favor of an estate, whether they be ue by bon, note, bill or open account, an is therefore but an effort of the Legislature to fix the respective rates of commission for the collection of each particular claim that may be severally of a sum uner one thousan ollars, of a sum between one thousan an five thousan, an of a sum above five thousan ollars.
If this proposition were true, it coul in no way benefit the appellant in this case, as it appears in this transcript, but the contrary. It cannot, however, be maintaine as true, either by the letter or by the obvious spirit of the statute. The letter of the statute is express that the commissions to be allowe the aministrator are, “for his risk an trouble in attening to the settlement of such estate,” not his risk an trouble in collecting any one eman, or even of all emans in favor of an estate. An it is obvious that the Legislature esigne to regulate the whole matter of an aministrator’s compensation, an not so much of his compensation only as ha relation to his service in collecting claims in favor of an estate; because the mischief esigne to be remeie must have been at least equal, if not greater, flowing from the exercise of the iscretion of the probate court in making compensation for services an risks of an aministrator, other than those relating to the collection of claims in favor of an estate.
The statute, when thus unerstoo as to the extent of its operation, oes not take away the iscretion of the probate court in fixing the compensation of aministrators; but only fixes a limit beyon which the allowance for compensation shall not go: the language of the statute is, that the court “ shall allow such executor or aministrator any sum not exceeing ten per centum,” &c.....“for his risk an trouble in attening to the settlement of such estate.” The probate court may therefore properly, in the exercise of a soun iscretion, fix the compensation at a rate of commission less than the maximum allowe by law, while in another case, it might with equal propriety allow the maximum of ten per centum commission for the first one thousan ollars of the true value of the estate,'five per centum on the next four thousan ollars of that value, an three per centum for so much of that value as was beyon five thousan ollars.
There is nothing in this recor to show to us, that the probate court of Monroe county abuse its iscretion, thus limite by statute, in refusing to allow the appellant the maximum of ten per centum on the first thousan ollars of the aggregate value of the estate of his intestate, an in fixing his compensation for settling up the estate at five per centum on the aggregate value; an we therefore fin no error in the jugment of the Circuit Court, which must be affirme, with costs against the appellant.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was action of replevin in the etinet. There was but one count, an in this it was allege in the usual form, that the efenant ha receive the plaintiff’s horse, an although often requeste ha not elivere him, but unlawfully etaine him. It was commence against Malay in his lifetime, who having been afterwars kille by Dalson, his aministrator, Phelan, interpose three pleas: first, non etinet', an in the other two, setting up property an the right of possession in ecease, Malay. Upon these pleas issues were joine, an submitte to a jury, who foun for Dalson, an jugment was renere accoringly. A new trial was move on the part of the aministrator, upon the groun of allege exclusion of competent testimony an of misirection of the jury. This motion was refuse an the cause was brought here by appeal upon a bill of exceptions.
From this, it appears that the line of efence relie upon an attempte to be establishe, was that the unqualifie ownership in the horse in question, of the ecease Malay in his lifetime, was in no egree affecte by the allege purchase of Dalson; because that originate in frau, an was consummate by the felonious act of knowingly paying the purchase money in counterfeit gol coin. To this en, the aministrator, after proving by a witness, that in February, 1852, Dalson came to the house of the ecease an offere him ninety ollars in gol for the horse; that he then left the house of the ecease, taking the horse along with him, accompanie by the ecease; that the ecease returne home after a short time, an forthwith hane over to the witness ninety ollars in gol pieces, which the witness then unerstoo from the ecease, that he ha receive from Dalson in payment for the horse, then offere to prove by the same witness the following aitional facts : That the ecease, Malay, ha no other money in his house at that time : that he owe two ebts in the neighborhoo, one of fifty ollars an the other of forty-five ollars ; that about that time he pai these two ebts with five ollar gol pieces : that the persons to whom these two several payments were mae, ascertaine that the gol pieces pai over to them by Malay were counterfeit gol coin, an immeiately returne them to Malay, then in life: that soon'after these facts transpire, Dalson left the country, an took with him the horse in question: that he was pursue an arreste on a charge of passing feloniously, ninety ollars of counterfeit gol coin on the ecease, Malay, was brought back to the county where the allege offence was committe, an there, after an examination by a competent court, was require to enter into a recognizance for his appearance before the Circuit Court of that county to answer that charge: that immeiately afterwars Dalsonkille Malay; an that certain eighteen pieces of counterfeit five ollar gol coin, then reay to be prouce to the jury, were the same that ha been pai over by Malay to the two persons before mentione, to whom he owe the ebts respectively. But the Circuit Court refuse to permit any of these facts to be proven to the jury, because, as is state in the bill of exceptions, “ that there was no proof nor offer on the part of the efenant to prove that the gol pieces allege to be counterfeit, were the same pai by Dalson to the ecease.”
It is true, that in this offer to prouce testimony to the jury there was no offer to prouce irect proof to establish the allege fact that the counterfeit gol coin prouce, were the same that were pai over by Dalson to Malay for the pui’chase money of the horse, but there was certainly an offer to prove a chain of facts an circumstances from which, although a conclusion to this effect woul not necessarily follow, it might have been arrive at by the jury within their just province. Even in criminal cases of the highest grae, that kin of circumstantial evience, classe by the elementary writers as uncertain, is amissible. But in such cases, “because of the more serious an irreparable nature of the consequences of a wrong ecision, the jurors are require to be satisfie beyon any reasonable oubt of the guilt of the accuse, or it is their uty to acquit him; the charge not being prove by that higher egree of evience which the law emans. In civil cases it is sufficient if the evience on the whole agrees with an supports the hypothesis which it is auce to prove; but in criminal cases it must exclue every other hypothesis, but that of the guilt of the party. In both cases a verict may be well foune on circumstances alone; an these often lea to a conclusion far more satisfactory than irect evience can prouce. (1 Greenl. Ev., 3 E. sec. 13, p. 74.
The court below therefore erre in refusing to permit proof of the facts, an circumstances offere to be shown in evience. Of their relevancy there coul be no question, as it is clear that where property has been, obtaine from the owner by a felonious act, his unqualifie ownership is not in the least change, an he may peaceably take it, in whose hans soever he may fin it. (Long on Sales, page 166, 7, 8, an cases there cite.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
On the 24th March, 1851, Brown sue Hutchings before a justice of the peace, on a note for $31 15, payable the llth ay of April, 1845, with interest at the rate of 10 per centum per'annum, from the 8th of September, 1841, an obtaine a jugment. Hutchings appeale to the Circuit Court of Pulaski county, an upon aerial e novo jugment was renere for Hutchings, an Brown appeale to this court, having taken a bill of exceptions to the ruling of the Circuit Court in excluing certain testimony, an for allege improper instructions to the jury.
In the latter court, as well as in the former, non assumpsit an the statute of limitations were interpose, an upon the trial of the issues forme in short by consent, Brown, after having rea in evience the note sue on, propose, in the language of his bill of exceptions, torea to the jury an- enorsement on the back thereof, in these wors : “Rec’ two ollars, 59 cents on this note, in recoring, &c., in 1848;” an to prove aliune that sai enorsement was mae on the note by the plaintiff before it was barre by the statute of limitation; but the court refuse to amit such evience, eciing that an actual part payment must be prove, an rejecting sai enorsement, an the testimony propose by the plaintiff to show that it was mae before the note was barre: an upon this ecision plaintiff close his case, excepting to the ecision of the court in so excluing such evience. An thereupon, the efenant offering no evience, the court tol the jury to take the case an fin from the face of the note whether it was barre or not, an that they ha nothing to o with the enorsement thereon. To all of which the plaintiff excepte.”
The enorsement, accompanie with the propose evience aliune, was competent; because it conuce to establish the fact of the allege part payment. Not that the enorsement of a ereit in any case of itself removes the statute bar; it has no such effect, but it is merely evience to be consiere by the jury among the circumstances going to show an actual part payment. An when proven to have been actually mae by the lawful holer of the note, within the statute bar, it is amissible in evience upon the general groun that at the time it was mae, it was against the interest of such holer to make it. Its effect, when so amitte, as has been several times holen in this court, (Woo vs. Wyl, 6 Eng. R. 758. State Bank vs. Wooy et al, 5 Eng. R. 641) is to make aprima facie case for the plaintiff in the absence of other evience to repel the presumption raise thereby. If other facts an circumstances shown in evience repel these presumptions, the plaintiff must necessarily make further proof of the allege part payment; otherwise he must fail.
In the case of The State Bank vs. Woy et al, those presumptions were repelle, an the prima facie case, which woul have been otherwise for the Bank, was overset by the aitional testimony, w’hich was introuce in her behalf.
So, in any case, if circumstances tening to show that the enorsement was not mae Iona fie, appear in the_ evience auce on either sie, they shoul always be consiere by the jury in coming to their conclusion whether or not an actual part payment was in fact mae, as allege an attempte to be proven by the enorsement, as a meium of evience. If, for instance, a very small creit enorse, was proven to have been mae the ay before the bar was complete on a large ebt, this circumstance woul be worthy of some consieration by the jury. Like any other fact, it is the especial province of the jury to etermine from the evience auce before them, whether in such a case the part payment allege was actually mae. If they fin that it was mae, then in the absence of facts an circumstances in proof to the contrary, they woul be authorize to fin that it was appropriate by the ebtor to the part payment of the ebt upon which they ha foun it was pai. An on this founation woul be authorize to fin a promise by the ebtor to pay the balance of that ebt, which promise, by force of the law removes the statute bar interpose as a efence.
In the case at bar we have sai that the enorsement in question, accompanie by the evience aliune offere, was amissible in evience, because it conuce to prove the allege part payment. This is certainly true in the case of a creit enorse generally, or enorse as pai in money, an we can conceive of no soun reason why the rule shoul not apply as well when the payment is enorse as having been in labor an services, as in property, or in a note of an account, which woul otherwise be matter of set off. Because, in either case, to enter a creit within the statute bar woul be equally against the interest of the creitor, an it is manifest that, in all these cases, greater facility woul be affore the efenant to repel by proof the prima facie case mae against him, as in this case, that Brown i not owe him the amount creite, or that he ha never consente to such án appropriation of it, than when the enorsement might merely purport to be a creit generally, or one because of the payment of money.
We think therefore that the court erre both in excluing the testimony an in giving instructions to the jury.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This cause was brought up by appeal from the chancery sie of Inepenence Circuit Court. It appears from the transcript sent up, in connection with what has been since certifie into this court in obeience to its process, that on the 17th ay of May, 1834, Nathaniel Cox, in accorance with the Territorial statute of that ay, file his petition in the Inepenence Circuit Court against James Boswell, aministrator of I-Iartvvell Boswell, ecease, Frances Ann Boswell, his wiow, an Elvira D. Boswell, a minor, their only chil, to foreclose a mortgage on certain lans. He set out a copy of the mortgage in the petition, amitte that the aministrator ha pai the sum of $592 34, on the 16th ay of April, 1833, an $1,000 on the 19thMaróh, 1834, on the mortgage ebt, an praye for a foreclosure for the resiue of the original, ebt of five thousan.ollars. At the November term 1834, Fowler, having in the meantime marrie the minor aughter, appeare an was mae a efenant also, an the cause was continue by consent. In the May term 1835, the aministrator an the wiow severally answere that they believe the allegations of the petition to be true, but knew nothing of their own knowlege. The aministrator set up the two partial payments mentione in the petition, an the wiow her claim of ower in the mortgage lans, an the cause was continue by consent. From this time until the Decemberterm 1841 inclusive, the cause was'regularly continue. On the 24th ay of Aug., 1842, in vacation, James Lawson, jr., file a sworn suggestion of the eath of Cox, an grant of letters testamentary upon his estate to him by the Probate Court of Pulaski county, of the eath of Frances Ann, the wiow, an of the eath of James Boswell, aministrator of Hartwell, an of the grant of aministration e bonis non, on the estate of the latter to Absalom Fowler, an cause a subpoena in the nature of a scire facias to be issue against Fowler an his wife, to show cause why the cause shoul not progress in the name of Lawson, aministrator of Cox,.
At the December term 1842, Fowler, without entering his appearance, move the court to quash the return on the scire facias, which was one, an the cause continue. From this time until the May term 1848, Lawson, at each term mae various efforts to progress with the cause, but was always repulse, until finally, uring that term, to wit: On the 6th June, 1848, he was overthrown, it having been consiere by the court, that the suit as to him shoul abate, that he shoul pay all costs that ha accrue as to him, an be allowe to withraw his exhibits theretofore file.
On the same ay, to wit: the 6th of June, 1848, Byers suggeste in open court, that Cox ha ie intestate, that aministration of his rights, creits an estate in Arkansas, ha been regularly grante to him; that James Bosw’ell, the former aministrator, an Frances Boswell, the wiow of Hartwell Boswell, was also ea; that aministration e bonis non on the estate of the latter, ha been grante to Absalom Fowler, an praye that the suit shoul be revive an procee in his name as aministrator of Cox against Fowler as a., an in his own right, an that a subpoena in the nature of a scire facias issue against him, to show cause why it shoul not, an also against Joseph H. Egner as trustee for Fowler, an against John Ruell. An thereupon Byers as aministrator of Cox file in court his amene an supplemental bill, an Fowler then, in proper person, appeare an waive process of subpoena, both for himself an as attorney for Egner an Ruell, an leave of court having been grante to plea, answer, or emur at the next term, the cause was continue.
In this bill he first alleges the grant of aministration to Mm on CosCs estate in Arkansas, the eath of the other persons heretofore mentione as having ie, an the grant of aministration on Boswell’s estate to F°wler, an prays that the cause may be revive, an then by way of amenment an supplement alleges that F°wler an wife, in January, 1842, by ee, conveye a portion of the njortgage lans to John Ruell, who took the same, with notice of the mortgage an of this suit. That in September, 3842, Fowler an wife conveye to 'YYm. F, Denton the resiue of the mortgage lans in trust, to sell them, an out of the procees pay, first, all incumbrances upon the lans conveye an pay the resiue to Fowler, or in case Fowler shoul pay off the incumbrances himself, to convey the lans to him on eman, an alleging that the incumbrance contemplate was that of the mortgage of Cox. That after the conveyance to Dentonin trust, Mrs. Fowler ha eparte this life without issue, an that Den-ton, the trustee, ha also ie, an that since his eath, Egner ha been substitute as trustee by the chancellor; an charging, upon belief, that the bill of exchange for $5,000 secure by the mortgage, was ate on the 3 ay of May, 1832, an payable on the first ay of April thereafter, but was in fact an in truth rawn of the 16th ay of April, an payable 12 months after ate, as recite in the mortgage ee, an alleging that there never was but one bill for $5,000 rawn on an in favor of the same parties, an that the bill of exchange in question was then on file in the Probate Court of Inepenence county. That it was accepte an pai by Cox in his lifetime. That he i not know where the original mortgage ee was; an pi’aying that if he shoul afterwars fin it, he might be allowe to use it in the progress an at the hearing of the cause : that the bill of exchange upon ue presentment ha been allowe against the estate of Hartwell Boswell, ecease, by James Boswell, aministrator in his lifetime. An praying that this his amenment an supplement to the original bill of Cox be taken an mae a part of the same: that Egner, Ruell an Fowler answer the whole. That the resiue of sai mortgage ebt, with interest be ecree to him as aministrator of Cox, an that the equity of reemption of all the efenants, an all other persons in the mortgage lans an tenements be foreclose, an that they be sol to satisfy the amount foun to be unpai, with interest an costs, an that the efenants be require to o whatever may be neeful to vest a complete title to the lans in the purchaser thereof.
It oes not appear that any process went out against the efenants; on the contrary, they entere their appearance, as we .have before state; an at the March term 1849, they file their several answers.
In several particulars the answers of Egner an Fowler maybe state together. They show a further sale an conveyance of a part of the mortgage lans in May, 1846, to one James Mull, for the sum of $400, its full value. They eny all knowlege of the mortgage, except that erive from the recor of it, an from rumor; amit the marriage of Fowler, the eath of Mrs. Fowler without issue: that uring her lifetime the conveyances were mae to Ruell an Denton, respectively ; the eath of James Boswell an Denton, an the wiow of Hartwell Boswell, that Fowler an Byers aministere respectively, as allege. That Egner was substitute as trustee after the eath of Denton, an. know nothing of the bill of exchange, or of its acceptance or payment beyon the recor of the mortgage an rumor.
Fowler’s answer also amits that the encumbrance, mentione in the ee of conveyance to Denton, in trust, was the mortgage lien in controversy. That he knew nothing of any bill of exchange for $5,000, in connection with this controversy, other than that escribe in the mortgage ee, an of that ha no other knowlege than that erive from the recor of the mortgage ee, an from rumor; enie the suppose mistake as to ate an time of maturity of the bill of exchange: allege that until within two years from 1849, he believe from this ata that such a bill of exchange as that escribe in the mortgage ee existe, an uner that impression ha correspone with Cox, an ha mae payments towars its ischarge of more than twelve hunre ollars, in the years 1843 an 1846; but proteste against being now prejuice by such payments. Then sets up full payment of the mortgage ebt, but prays, in case of an averse ecree, that Ruell an Mull may be protecte accoring to the principle of equity.
Ruell, in his answer, enies all knowlege of the bill of exchange, an of the mortgage ee, claims protection as a purchaser, for a valuable consieration without notice, an from lapse of time, an sets up the statute of limitations : then exhibits cross interrogatories, in the nature of a crossbill, praying that in case a ecree shall be renere in favor of Cox’s representatives, certain lans, not mortgage, but inclue in the conveyance in trust to Denton, shall be first sol in satisfaction of the sum ecree. An in this prayer the answers of Fowler an Egner concur.
To these answers the complainanl entere his replication, an then Egner, Byers an Fowler, file their answers to Ruell’s cross bill.
Fowler an Egner fully amit that the lans conveye by Fowler an wife to Denton in trust were esigne primarily to-increase the security for the mortgage ebt to Cox, if any portion-of it shoul be foun unpai, but protesting against any application of this fun unless the mortgage ebt shall be fully establishe, agree that, if an}' ecree shall be renere in favor of Cox’s representative, the lans shall be sol in the orer praye for by Ruell.
Byers amits that the lans were conveye to Denton in trust for the purpose allege, an that they are situate in the county of Inepenence; but sets up that the conveyance was mae by Fowler an wife, voluntarily, an without the knowlege of Cox, or his heirs or representatives, an that they, nor any of them, have ever one any thing to relieve or ischarge the lans purchase by John Ruell from Fowler an wife.
At the September term, 1850, the cause was finally hear upon the merits, an the opinion of the court being against the complainant, his bill was ismisse with costs.
The first question mae is, as to the competency an sufficiency of the evience prouce, that Cox, in his lifetime pai the raft against which the mortgage was esigne to inemnify him; an it is insiste that, as against the heir of H. Boswell in a proceeing to subject lan escene, in which preicament Fowler-presents himself, amissions of James Boswell, the aministrator, woul be incompetent, an that it woul be alike incompetent to-prove the signature of Elkins .to a receipt enorse on the bill of exchange acknowleging its payment from Cox, the acceptor, until a founation ha been lai for the introuction of such seconary evience. It appears, however, that besies the testimony thus objecte to, the complainant prouce an prove to this point on the trial, the original mortgage ee, an an original bill of exchange, corresponing in all respects with that escribe in the mortgage, except that it was ate on the 3 of May an was payable on the first ay of April following, an prove by T. R. Hye, one of the firm in whose favor the bill was rawn, that this was the only bill of exchange for that sum ever rawn by Boswell .in his lifetime on Cox, in favor of the firm of T. Ri Hye an Brother, of which he ha any knowlege, an that Cox pai this bill. He recognizes the enorsement of T. R. Hye & Brother, on this bill, an also the signature of Elkins as genuine, but oes not recollect how the latter came to have any connection with the bill; he thinks, however, that the firm never parte with it without the money — its value.
It is objecte against the weight of this testimony of Hye, that it is vague an uncertain, that he was only one member of the firm; that the firm, in all probability, ha clerks an bookkeepers ; that he makes no reference at all to the books of the firm, which might, by possibility, exhibit many such rafts ; that such a reference might have refreshe his memory as to Elkins’ connection with the raft an other matters, an have enable him to speak positively, an not express his inferences an thoughts, as he i to some extent; an that the eposition was not taken until some sixteen years after the facts testifie to ha transpire, when it coul not reasonably be suppose that the efenants coul reaily fin rebutting evience, which may have been swept off by eath. If these matters work harship they cannot justly be lai at the oor of Cox, or his representatives, as the face of this recor testifies. An issue might have been forme an epositions taken before the expiration of fifteen year’s from the commencement of this proceeing, if the efenants from time to time ha manifeste more isposition to approach the merits of the controversy. An when the isposition of Hye was taken, a few months after the issue was forme, the efenants ha the privilege of cross examination, an by that means might have cleare up the very uncertainty of which he now complains, if in any way likely to operate to his prejuice. (Johnson vs. Cocks, use &c., 7 Eng. R. 682.)
Without then any ai from the testimony objecte to as incompetent, we think that the possession of an proof of the authenticity of the mortgage ee, an of the bill of exchange prouce by the complainant, in connection with the testimony of Hye, makes a prima facie case for the complainant as to this point, which must prevail against the enial of the answers on belief, an any inference that may be rawn from the testimony of Ringgol, that Hartwell Boswell an Cox were “skillful business men, an if they reuce a matter or contract to writing, they woul put it own on paper as they intene it.” Any inference from which testimony being, in our opinion, more than repelle by the resience of the parties respectively, the usual course of business between Batesville an New Orleans, an the probable conuct of this particular transaction in inference to the locality of the parties an usual course of trae.
An we rest upon this conclusion, notwithstaning the array of authorities cite to show that where a party goes into a court of equity to reform a writing on the allege groun of mistake, or otherwise seeks relief there upon the groun of mistake, that the proof of the allege mistake must be strong an conclusive. This is not a proceeing of that character; but a proceeing to recover a mortgage ebt an subject lans mortgage to its payment, in which the matter of mistake is but inciental, an only concerns the evience as to the main issue, like matters of every ay occurrence in the courts of law, as where a party executes a note to an iniviual an commits an error in writing his name, or misescribes some subject matter of a contract. The remey in such cases is not base upon the mistake, but is ha, in spite of it, upon the contract, the mistake nevertheless.
Fining in the recor no evience to repel this prima facie case, an assuming the existence of the mortgage ebt, we will procee to the evience of its payments.
The payment of five hunre an ninety-two thirty-four Run* reths ollars, on the 16th of May, 1833, an of one thousan ollars on the 17th of March, 1834, is amitte in the complainant’s bill as having been mae by James Boswell, aministrator. The payment of five hunre ollars by the same on the 12th of October, 1836, is also satisfactorily shown by the receipt of Cox of that ate, The payment of five hunre ollars in the raft of John Ringgol on Charles Baltzell, of Baltimore, some time in the year 1836, is shown by the eposition of Ringgol-. Although it is insiste in argument that this latter payment is ientical with that for which the receipt was given in October, 1836, no evience is prouce on the part of the complainant to rebut this jorima facie evience of two ifferent payments in that year of $500 each; one in cash, an the other in a raft realize by Cox “in some way,” as the witness testifies, an as no ay is proven in that year for the latter payment, we shall fin the same to have been mae on the 31-st ay of December, 1.836, the ay most favorable for the complainant. It is also proven satisfactorily that on the 1st ay of February, 1843, Absalom Fowler-pai to Trapnall & Cocke, as the attorneys of the heirs at law an other legal representatives of Cox, ecease, the sum of eleven hunre an fifteen ollars on account of the mortgage ebt, by the assignment of a jugment in favor of A. Foner vs. Wilson & Thorn in the Pulaski Circuit Court; an as it is not allege or in any way shown that the amount of this jugment was not realize, an it appearing from the recor that this transaction must necessarily have come to the knowlege of the complainant before his suit was brought into this court, an that he retaine Mr. Trapnall (the survivor of the firm of Trapnall & Cocke) as his attorney in this cause, after the transaction must have come to his knowlege, we shall hol that he thereby ratifie an aopte the act of receiving the assignment of this jugment in part payment of the mortgage ebt, an fin this payment mae accoringly, as of the ate of the receipt. We also fin another payment of one hunre ollars mae as of the ate of February 6th, 1846, by Egner, as trustee, to William Byers as attorney for the aministrator an legal representatives of Cox, ecease, on account of the mortgage ebt in question.
It is insiste on the part of the efence, that beyon these several payments, which we have foun, the evience establishes other payments to the extent of a full satisfaction of the mort.gage ebt proceee for; an we shall now irect our attention to that question.
The transcript from the Probate 'Court of Inepenence county, exhibits a partial settlement of James Boswell’s aministration account mae of the 5th an-6th of April, 1837, commencing with an item as “brought forwar” from a settlement mae at October term, 1834, by which he is charge with a balance in his hans at that settlement of $7,181 90; to this is ae $1,--580 70, as a balance brought from a settlement at October term, 1835, an the amount of $60 35, the amount of a supplemental! inventory, making an aggregate of $9,222 32, against him. From this are eucte ivers items allowe him upon vouchers, an the settlement closes with leaving a balance of assets in his hans to the amount of $4,659 12. Of what this balance of assets] consists — whether in slaves or other property, or in ioses in action, an if so, whether likely to be mae available or not, or whether alreay realize, in no way appears.
George Thompson testifies that he was living with James Boswell at the time of his eath, as he ha been for several years before, an ha the principal management of a tan yar; that, on some occasion, six or seven months before his eath — or it might have been a less time, or a greater — he exhibite to the witness a large amount of silver money, in a rawer, “about a peck or a half peck,” an tol him that it belonge to Hartwell Boswell’s estate, an that he (James Boswell) “ ha a particular use for it an woul not use it” — the witness wanting some of it. He gave witness some money, however, out of another rawer, to be lai out on account of the tan yar. The witness sai he ha never been in the habit of using, or counting such large sums of money an coul not speak as to the amount. Thathe assiste in packing up the things about James Boswell’s house after his eath, an saw no money then, an that he ispose of some stock of the estate to buy mourning clothes for the wiow.
Ringgol testifie that James Boswell was not engage in any extexrsive business for several years before his eath; that'he was close an systematic in his business an very economical in his family. That a peck of silver money well packe woul be $2,500, or if'a peck measure was fille cax’elessly, it woul not hol more than fifteen or sixteen hunre ollar’s. That he ha been a Cashier of a Bank, an in the habit of counting silver money. That James Boswell was in the habit of frequently talking to him about his business, an that he i not know of his having purchase property, or of his having gone into any speculation within two years of his eath, in which he coul have ispose of two thousan ollars. ■„
Egner testifie that he ha known James Boswell from the year 1823, until October, 1840, when he ie. That he frequeixt]y talke to him about his business matters an about the Cox claim. That in the summer before he ie he “tappe him on the shouler an they took a seat on a bench, an he tol him that the Cox claim woul be pai, that that ebt will now be pai with money Col. Fowler ha collecte from McHenry, on the Arkansas river.” That he “ unerstoo him that that ebt woul be pai with the money on han, an what Col. Fowler ha collecte was a small sum of some two or three hunre ollars, the balance of a claim of the estate of Hartwell Boswell against McHemy.” That afterwars, on the same ay he tol him “that he ha five hunre ollars in Arkansas Bank bills eposite in the Bank at Batesville, which belonge to the estate of Hartwell Boswell,” which, he “unerstoo” to be ifferent money from that he ha before spoken of. That he frequently spoke to the witness about the Cox ebt, an manifeste great anxiety that it shoul be pai, an tol him that it was the “only ebt which the estate owe.” That James Boswell’s manner of oing business was “very systematic an particular, as much so as any man he ever knew in his life.” That he ha a general knowlege of Jas. Boswell’s business an woul have “ known of any trae he coul have mae, whereby he woul have use 1500, or 2000, or $2500 within two years before he ie — was satisfie he coul not have one so without the knowlege of the witness. That he never knew of his making any trae of any importance without consulting witness. That he i not speculate in those times. That he was not extravagant, an when he ie left his wiow estitute of money, an, for a number of years, she an her chilren were supporte by her relations. Upon cross examination, he sai it was his “ unerstaning” from the conversation with Boswell “ that with the money he ha on han an what Col. Fowler ha collecte, the Cox ebt woul then be pai,” “not that it was then pai, but that it woul be pai, every thing was reay to pay.”
We conceive that this statement of so much of the testimony as is most favorable to the efenant, without regar to any question as to the competency of any of it, an giving to the efenant all the benefit that he coul possibly esire from a concession of the agency of James Boswell, for the representatives of Cox, as claime on that sie, presents the point nowuner examination in its strongest possible attitue for the efence. An yet it must be concee that the case thus mae ^es not come up to the proof of any payment at a-11: an the most that coul be claime for it woul be, that it woul authorize payment to be presume, in the absence of repelling proofs, to some amount ranging from fifteen hunre ollars to an amount falling short a few hunre ollars of the resiue of the mortgage ebt. It woul be impossible to presume a complete payment of the resiue of the ebt, because upon the groun contene for by the efence (to wit: that an appropriation by Boswell, as aministrator, of funs in his hans as such, to the claims of Cox’s representatives in his hans for collection, as agent for the' latter, was in law an equity equivalent to an actual payment to the representatives of Cox) the testimony of Egner shows istinctly that the five hunre ollars in Arkansas Bank notes, which Boswell ha eposite in the Bank at Batesville, were not inclue in the sum with which the Cox ebt was to be pai, an with equal istinctness that the two or three hunre ollars that Fowler ha collecte from McHenry were inclue in that sum, an it cannot be taken that this two or three hunre ollars ha been at that time pai over by Fowler to Boswell, because, if so there coul be no reason to iscriminate between money then on ■han, an that which ha been collecte by Fowler from McHenry, which is so emphatically mae an repeate by Egner in his •eposition, an there is no evience at all in the recor that this, -or any other sum of money was ever pai to Boswell by Fowler! So far then from Egner’s testimony establishing a founation from which the whole resiue of the mortgage ebt may be presume to have been pai, it even negatives a presumption of a partial payment, until it shoul be shown, as it has not been, that Fowler pai over the two or three hunre ollars spoken of, as ■having been collecte by him from McHenry.
There is no groun to infer from Egner’s eposition, that all ■the money in han, except that collecte by Fowler from McHenry ha been appropriate to the Cox ebt, but that the whole •ebt, as an entirety, woul he pai with the aggregate of the sum •onhan axiá-ihat collecte hy Fowler.
Nor oes the evience of Ringgol an Thompson give any essential strength to the efence upon this point, amitting every wor of the latter to be true, an giving the shape of sober fact to any possible creation of an imagination stimulate by the exhibition of such a “big pile” of silver money, as to be compute by measure rather than by count, because Thompson in express terms, testifies that the money was exhibite to him “as belonging to the estate of Hartwell Boswell;” an he says, it is true, that Boswell sai “he ha a particular use for it.” But there ■can be no pretence that Boswell spoke then as the agent of the -representatives-of Cox, for from the whole conversation epose about, it is manifest that if he spoke for any one other than himself, as he plainly i, it must have been for those intereste in the Boswell estate, of which he was aministrator.
The evience then, when the fullest latitue is given to it, oes not show any appropriation in fact, but simply an intention of the aministrator to appropriate, at some -uncertain future time, in which sum intene to be appropriate, the five hunre ollars eposite in Bank are not inclue, while the contrary is true of the sum collecte by Fowler of McHenry, of the subsequent paying over of which to Boswell there is no evience. Nor any evience of any subsequent acts or eclarations of Boswell conucing to show that he ever afterwars took any action whatever in the premises.
It seems then perfectly clear that there is no founation for any presumption, in fact, that the entire resiue of the mortgage ebt was ever pai.
It is contene, however, upon the groun that James Boswell was the agent of the representatives of Cox, to receive the mortgage ebt from himself, as the aministrator of Hartwell Boswell, that if the evience shows money in his hans, arising from the estate of the latter, an no other ebt against the estate of his intestate except the mortgage ebt, that the law will presume that he hols the money in his capacity of agent, ■ an not in that of aministrator. If this proposition be true, then although the money collecte by Fowler may not have been pai over, nevertheless if the aggregate of the five hunre ollars ae to such other sums as the evience may show in his hans, shoul be equal to the resiue of the mortgage ebt, the law woul presume the mortgage ebt fully pai. But the proposition is not true. It is true only of those cases of ouble capacity where the party cannot sue himself as executor an creitor, or guarian. The more ancient rule of the common law was, that where such a ouble capacity was create by act of a party creitor, as woul suspen an action, the ebt or uty woul be thereby extinguishe. The more moern rule, instea of extinguishing the ebt or uty, allows it to be satisfie by way of retainer. It was from this source that the law of retainer sprung. In cases where retainer was allowe, because otherwise there woul be no remey, as in cases where a party was both trustee an aministrator of averse rights, or executor an guarian, the law works a transmutation by its own force, an always presumes that a party having a ouble capacity, takes an hols in that capacity in which of right he ought to take an hol, an as to thir persons, hols him boun to o so. In cases, however, where a party has another remey besies that of retainer, there is no groun upon which to presume that he elects to retain until he manifests an intention to o so by some overt act, some affirmative action. An even in cases where there was no other remey than by retainer, affirmative action has been hel necessary in some cases, but the better opinion is as we have state it. The ouble capacity of aministrator an agent for a creitor of the estate, is certainly not one of the former class, an if in such case, the legal right of retainer exists at all, which to say the least, is oubtful, a party claiming its benefit, woul have to show that an election to retain ha been mae.
In any view then, of the case mae for the efence by the testimony, when consiere in its greatest latitue, an without reference to competency, an allowing every possible avantage to be erive from the agency of James Boswell, contene for, it is clear beyon peraventure, that there is no sufficient groun establishe to authorize a presumption either in law or in fact, that the entire resiue of the mortgage ebt bas been pai.
Nor is there any case mae by the efence in this connexion, or any other, for the application of the principle of equity contene for, that where one of two innocent parties must suffer from confience repose; that party ought to suffer whose act enable the frau or injury to be worke. If any loss or injury has fallen upon the heirs or representatives of Hartwell Boswell, in consequence of the allege agency of James Boswell, it has been in no manner shown in this cause to any extent whatsoever. But much of the evience of which we have given the efenant the full benefit in the views of the case which we have taken is altogether incompetent.
It is very far from being the law that where an agency is establishe, it follows that the eclarations of the agent are competent evience, merely because they are his eclarations. On the contrary, it may be safely sai that, as mere eclarations, they are never competent, because what one man says, not upon oath, cannot be evience against another man, who was absent an ha no opportunity, by any question or observation to set it right if incorrectly sai.
Nor, is it true, that the amissions of the agent can be fully as • similate to the amissions of the principal; because a mere assertion, or narrative or observation of the agent, although it may relate to the business of his agency, may be often easily istinguishe from, an fall far short of an amission of the principal, mae through the meium of his agent, an therefore coul not be use against the latter; whereas every assertion, narrative or observation of the party himself, wherever or whenever mae touching the business, may be prove against him. An hence, there maybe many material facts interesting to either party resting in the knowlege of the agent, which like any other facts may be proven by evience, an not by the proof of mere assertions, or representation of those facts; an therefore, if sought to be establishe by the agent, must be establishe by his evience uner oath, an not by proving what he might have sai about them, against one who was absent when he sai it.
Those amissions of the agent then, which are amissible against the principal, are not of the nature of hearsay evience, strictly speaking, but are of the nature of original evience more liberally speaking. “It is because the amission of the agent is a verbal act an part of the res gestee; that it is amissible at all.” (1 Greenl. Ev. sec. 113.) The act an the wors together, as an entirety, make the whole thing to be prove — the ultimate fact, (4th Wen. R. 397,) an as such it may be establishe by any witness who saw an hear it, or by any other legal instrument of evience which, may contain it. Ilence, all wors of an agent which accompany his authoritative act, an ten to etermine its quality, are always bining on the principal because he is boun by the act, an must be boun by the wors which show its quality, an are therefore a part of it, though verbal. It was upon this principle that all that was sai by an agent at the time of settlement of accounts, was hel competent in the case cite from 4 Wen. Rep., whereas, what he sai about the settlement seventeen months afterwars, was not allowe to be proven, not because his agency ha then expire, but because it was the mere representation or assertion of the agent, which the court say coul not have been proven, “ if mae one hour after the business was close.”
So in the case of Laughen vs. Allnult, 4 Taunt. Rep. 511, letters of an agent sent abroa containing narratives of the transactions in which he was employe, were not allowe to be rea against his principal, because not a part of the res gestee but merely an account of them.
On the other han, the answer of a eputy sheriff to an inquiry of the plaintiff’s attorney respecting the execution while in force, was amitte against the sheriff in the case of Matt vs. Kip, 10 John. R. 478. because mae in the course of the transaction, an to a party in interest, an hence consiere a part of the act of the eputy touching the execution.
So in the case of Wescott vs. Brafor, (4 Wash. C. C. R. 500,) the court consiere that amissions of the eputy collector as to the cause of the seizure of some rum mae at the time that Brafor signe the information against the vessel, were compepetent to be prove against the collector: but refuse to amit like amissions mae the same ay after the seizure ha been mae an the rum in store.
An there are numerous other cases, all to the same general effect that whatever an agent may say either before or after the making of a contract, or the oing of an authoritative act is not evience against the’""principal unless it form a part of the res gestw, or has some^necessary connexion with it, an is thus a part of the contract, or act itself, although verbal. An evience of what an agent may have thus sai, is not amitte to prove the truth or falsity of what was sai, because the principal is equally boun by what was sai, whether it be true or false. (See generally Dunlap's, Paley’s Agency, 3 Amer. Eition, p. 266, note 1, an authorities there collecte, an p. 270, note 1, an authorities collecte.)
When brought to the test of these legal principles, much of the eposition of Egner must be rejecte as incompetent. It cannot be pretene that when the conversation between Egner an James Boswell occurre, that the latter was then engage in the oing of any act in virtue of his employment of agent for the representatives of Cox, in the progress of the business of such agency, an that that conversation was part an parcel of such authoritative act, conucing to show its quality, or that the statements of Boswell to Egner were in response to inquiries of any one intereste either in any business of the estate of Boswell, or of the estate of Cox, then in progress of being transacte, whereby the statements of Boswell coul by possibility be construe into verbal acts for either estate. But on the contrary, they were voluntary statements of Boswell to an inifferent person, mae by his own seeking, to unburthen his own min in the expression of his gratification at the probable near approach of an event that he ha long an anxiously esire to occur, an about which he may have been so long an so often baffle, that now when the thought ha been begot, whether by sober fact or by the wish, he coul not withstan the impulse to communicate it to a frien.
All the statements then, of Boswell to Egner so much insiste upon by the efence, that the Cox ebt woul now be pai with certain funs, that five hunre ollars in Arkansas Bank notes belonging to the estate of Boswell, were eposite in Bank, an that the Cox ebt was the only ebt which the estate owe, were clearly incompetent as against the representatives of Cox.
An when the eposition of Thompsonis brought to the same test, it cannot possibly amount, as competent evience (tening in the least to show payment,) beyon proof that the “peck of silver money” belonge to the estate of his ea brother. Thompson, an employee of James Boswell, it seems, applie to the latter for money to be use in the business of the latter. In the act of thus attening to his own business, James Boswell exhibits this “peck of silver money” in a rawer by itself, an passes over the esire money out of another rawer. When the witness expresse a wish to have some of the “peck of silver money” Boswell tol him he coul not have it, as it belonge to Hart-well Boswell’s estate, an he wante: it for a particular purpose.”' The substantive act in process of being one, about which all the evience of Thompson relates, was an act of James Boswell in the transaction of his own business, an not any act in the transaction of any business of his brother’s estate: his verbal statements in strictness, but show the quality an become part an parcel of his own act, not any act in his representative capacity. Incientally, however, to his own act in resisting the application of Thompson for some of the “peck of silver money,” he assumes to perform a uty of his representative character in refusing to use funs, which he says, are in his hans in that character. If this was a bona fie representative act, the wors conuce to show its quality an become evience that the money was inee the money of the estate, an woul be competent as far as it went against the representatives of Cox; but if, on the contrary, it was but a shift to evae the application of Thompson for some of the money, which, it is strongly infei'rable from his eposition, he wante for his own purposes, an not for the purposes of Boswell, his emplojmr, as he i the money he receive out of the other rawer, then the wors but showe the quality of Boswell’s act in his own X’ight, an coul not be competent evience as against the representatives of Cox. Uner this pex’plexity it is perhaps safer to hol that the woi’s wei’e competent to show that the money belonge to the estate of Boswell, an let the oubt as to its competency go to its weight. As, however, in either event, James Boswell cannot possibly be suppose from the evience of Thompson to have assume any uty of his representative character beyon the mere preservation of the suppose funs hel in his fiuciary character, in making this answer to Thompson, no wors going beyon that uty coul be competent as against the representatives of Cox, consequently the wors, that “he ha a particular use ¡for the money,” coul not be competent at all, or if so to any extent, only to that of conucing to prove as part of the act of preserving the funs, that they were funs of the estate, an coul not by possibility be competent to prove any appropriation of these funs to the payment of the mortgage ebt, for there was no such act of payment assume to be one primarily or incientally, for such wors to qualify an enter into. The very most that can possibly be mae of the whole matter, as shown by Thompson’s eposition is, that primarily, James Boswell was acting in the transaction of his own private business, an that seconarily, he performe the representative uty .of refusing to use the funs of the estate of his intestate for his own private purposes. The fact that he i the latter an that he kept such funs in a separate rawer from his own, is in exact accorance with his uty as aministrator, an with the exemplary character an accurate business habits of the man, as shown on the part of the efence; an therefore affor no presumption of the appropriation of the money to the payment of the mortgage ebt as woul have arisen, ha it been shown that he was in the general habit of mixing his private funs with those of the estate, using but one common purse.
Giving then, again, to the efence the utmost force of all that remains of the testimony, conucing to prove facts from which any further payments may be presume than those we have foun respectively, it amounts to but the establishment of the fact, an that by the testimony of Thompson, mainly, that James Boswell, in his character of aministrator, ha some uncertain amount of money in his hans, an upon this fact, in connection with the aitional facts, that he was an agent of the representatives of Cox, to collect the money from himself as aministrator of Hartwell Boswell, an was a man of accurate, cautious, an pains taking business habits, almost always consulting with the witnesses, Ringgol an Egner, in progressing with his matters of business, we are calle upon to presume aitional payments. There are several ifficulties in our way in making such a presumption ; some of which are insurmountable.
We have seen that the law will not presume a transmutation of the funs from Boswell, aministrator, to Boswell, agent, as it woul o, if all proper ifficulties were remove, between Boswell, aministrator, an Boswell, guarian, for instance, because the latter capacities are so incompatible that there coul be no remey by suit, an therefore the law steps in an affors the remey by way of retainer; whereas, in this case the orinary impeiments to retainer in a proper case are not remove by the evience — as by showing that there was no other possible use for the funs but to pay the mortgage ebt: an in this case, where Cox’s representatives coul have sue Boswell, aministrator, although the same Boswell was the agent of Cox, the law oes not step in an affor a remey by way of retainer, until it be first shown, as it has not been, that Boswell, the aministrator an agent, by some open act electe .to transmute the funs. An it is not probable that any court of competent jurisiction woul allow an aministrator the amount of a payment claime as having been mae to himself, as agent, unless istinctly shown, an until after the most thorough scrutiny, if at all. An so far from the proof of the business habits of James Boswell, an of his habitual free communications with his friens, Ringgol an Egner, afforing us ai in malting the esire presumption of payment, even if the links in the testimony, which we have inicate, were not wanting, they ten strongly to the contrary, an we can but feel that they militate against the verity of Thompson’s statements, as to his having seen the “peck of silver money;” which, on the other han, might be sustaine by some circumstances that woul allow'of his having seen some few hunre, which his inexperience eyes might have cause his imagination to magnify. For it can but seem remarkable that, upon the part of the efence, some trace of the outgoings of so much money shoul not have been shown by the evience of these witnesses, which is so full an explicit that there was no money on han at the eath of James Boswell. If it ha been pai out in Bates-ville, a man of James Boswell’s business habits an free intercourse with Ringgol an Egner, as shown by the testimony, woul scarcely havegacte without leaving some trace in the knowlege of these witnesses; nor is the probability less, if he ha remitte it by mail, as to some fact connecte with the remittance being within their knowlege.
An having now first foun that the complainant ha mae out his case, an that towars the satisfaction of the mortgage ebt certain partial payments have been from time to time mae, of the sums an as of the ates that we have specifie respectively ; an lastly that no further payments have been mae, or can be presume for the efenants, we eem it totally unnecessary to go further into the testimony, either to strengthen the complainant’s case, or to weaken the probabilities that any further payments have been mae than those that we have foun, although there are several facts an circumstances, other than those we have notice, which ten to both ens, an to fortify our conclusions, both as to the complainant’s equity in the matter of the mortgage ebt, an as to the total want of efenant’s equity on account of partial payments towars its satisfaction, beyon what we have allowe. Having, as we conceive, sai enough for the founation of our jugment, that the complainant shoul have a ecree for the resiue of the mortgage ebt.
The claims of Ruell an Egner, an that set up on behalf of Mull, that they were purchasers for a valuable consieration without-notice, are totally inamissible. They were all purchasers, not only with notice by the registry of the mortgage ee, but were purchasers penente lite. It is a mistake to suppose that there was any chasm in the proceeings, or, at any rate, any such chasm as woul let these parties out from being purchasers penente lite. It is true there is no express orer of court making Lawson a party complainant, but the court allowe process to go out in his name, allowe him to file an amene bill, an other pleaings, an in various ways treate him as a party complainant, an finally renere a jugment against him for costs, when uner an erroneous iea of its power to reverse the proceeings of the Pi’obate Court of Pulaski county, it orere the suit to abate as to him. We have, therefore the most abunant groun upon which to presume that a formal orer of court was mae, amitting him to become a party complainant, when he first went into court as a suitor. An when the suit was after-wars abate as to Lawson, it was forthwith revive in the name of Byers, aministrator, in whose name it progresse to the final ecree.
We think, therefore, that the lans in controversy are clearly subject to the mortgage ebt; that the equity of reemption in them shoul be foreclose ; that they shoul be sol, an the procees applie towars its satisfaction, an the efenants shoul be ecree to o whatever may be neeful to perfect title in the purchasers.
The cross equity set up by Ruell, is concee by Fowler an Egner, an they concur in his prayer for the relief base upon it. Byers, as aministrator of Cox, however, insists upon his rights, an concees nothing. To the extpnt that the prayer of Ruell (thus concurre in by Fowler an Egner) craves relief by a ecree that certain lans, not inclue in the mortgage to Cox, (but conveye by Fowler an wife, along with a portion of the mortgage lan to Denton, as trustee, for this purpose,) shall be first sol, an then that the mortgage lans shall be sol, may be well grante, without militating against the right of Byers, as aministrator of Cox. An relief to that extent shoul therefore be ecree for Ruell; an then further effort for his relief may be safely mae by irecting that next afterwars, such of the mortgage lans as were not sol to Ruell, shall be then sol, an in the last place, thatthe resiue of the mortgage lans, being those sol by Fowler to Ruell, shall be sol. The relief sought for Mull, is inamissible.
In orer to ascertain the resiue of the mortgage ebt, for which the ecree shall be renere in favor of Byers, aministrator of Cox, against the efenants, interest must be compute at the rate of five per centum per annum, from the first ay of April, A. D. 1833, upon the sum of five thousan ollars, up to the 16th of May, of that year, an ae to the principal sum, an from that aggregate, the first payment, which we have specifie, must be eucte; then interest at the same rate must be compute on the balance foun from the 16th of May, 1833, up to the 17th of March, A. D. 1834, when the payment of one thousan ollars was mae, an so on until the last payment shall have been eucte, an then the ecree shall be renere for the balance thus foun ue, together with costs, with interest at the same rate until pai by a sale of the lans or otherwise.
An this ecree must be so restricte as to exten only in its effects against the lans in controversy, specifie in the bill an cross bill, although in terms against the efenants, there being no grouns of relief lai in the bill beyon such as may be ha by a sale of the lans in question.
The ecree of the Circuit Court of Inepenence county, must therefore be reverse, an the cause remane to that court, with instructions to enter up a ecree in accorance with this opinion, an to execute it accoringly.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the court.
This was a proceeing by petition for a manamus to compel the efenant, as sheriff, to acknowlege a ee for certain lans, which the petitioner claims as purchaser at a juicial sale.
The petition is very full, as are also the recitals in the alternative writof manamus. The substance of the groun for manamus, is, that the efenant, as sheriff, offere for sale certain lots of lan, as the property of the Bank : that Johnson, at the instance of the state, an for her benefit, bi off the lan: that the State has been, an is yet reay an willing to pay the sum bi an has tenere the same to the sheriff, who refuse to receive it: that the sheriff well knowing these facts, execute an elivere to Johnson a ee to the State for sai lan: that the sheriff refuses to acknowlege such ee. An prays that he be require to o so, or to show cause why he shoul not be compelle so to o.
The efenant ecline acknowleging the ee,an for cause shows, that the lan was bi off by Johnson, as the attorney for the Bank, an that the petitioner was wholly unknown to him as purchaser: that he applie to Johnson for the sum bi which he refuse to pay; that uner the statute, upon such refusal, it became his uty to re-offer the property for sale, an that he i at the time an place, re-offer sai lan for sale, an sol it to Thomas W. Newton, to whom he execute an acknowlege a ee. Pie positively enies that either Johnson or the State or any one for them, tenere or offere the sum bi, until long after the complete consummation of the secon sale to Newton, but amits a tener by the State after that time. That his eputy took lists of the sales an mae out ees for the purchasers; that he has no recollection of having either signe or elivere a ee for the lan either to Johnson or the State. He is positive that he never intene to o so: that ees were mae out an signe, reay to be elivere when the purchase money was pai. Such ees were usually kept in a box in the clerk’s esk, an may have been taken without his knowlege.
To this response the State mae two replications: first, that the responent i not again offer sai lots for sale, at the time an place at which the first sale was mae: secon, that he i execute such ee to the State for sai lots, an that the same is his act anee. The first of these replications conclues to the country the secon, with a verification. An issues being taken upon them, they were submitte for trial to the court sitting as a jury. After hearing the evience the court foun for the efenant an renere jugment accoringly.
No exception was taken to the opinion of the court on a question of law, except as to the amissibilit}r of a certain eposition. An as there was no motion for a new trial, the correctness of the ecision of the court in excluing such evience presents the only legitimate question to be etermine.
The objection to the eposition, was that the official character of the justice, before whom the same was taken in Kentucky, was not sufficiently authenticate, in this, that what purporte to be the seal of'the Jefferson Circuit Court, was an impression upon paper, without wax or other soft tenacious substance. The court hel this objection goo an exclue the eposition. In this the court erre. In the absence of evience to the contrary, the court shoul have presume in favor of the regularity of the proceeing from the sister State. There may have been a statute there like our own, eclaring that an impression upon paper shall be a sufficient sealing: an whether this be the case or not, the later ecisions of the courts go to iscourage the objection an hol it frivolous. Pillow vs. Roberts, 13 How. U. S. S. C. Rep. 472. 7 Eng. 822.
But then the question recurs, amitting the epositions to be in other respects, unexceptionable, were they amissible uner the issue forme by the parties?
Waiving the consieration of the question whether a writ of manamus is the appropriate remey in this case, which we think extremely oubtful, an conceing the power of the court to compel the officer to perform a legal uty, still the court woul not exercise such power until a clear legal uty was shown, an it was mae to appear that the officer ha faile or refuse to perform it.
In this case the sheriff is calle upon to acknowlege a ee, which purports to have been execute by him as such to the petitioner. It is concee that the bi was mae by Johnson, an it is not shown that the sheriff was aware that the State ha any interest in the bi uuless after the secon sale of the property; but so far from this, the sheriff, in his answer uner oath, positively e nies all knowlege of the fact until after the secon sale: An this answer must be taken as true, because it is not questione by replication, nor is it isproven by other evience. The sheriff thus is cut off from all knowlege of the acts of the State. He coul not request her to pay, because she was unknown to him; an for the same reason an ability or reainess to pay by the Bank, not having been brought home to the sheriff, amounte to nothing. Thus left with Johnson, as the only known bier, who refuse to pay the sum bi, the sheriff, in obeience to the statute, re-offere the property, an sol it to a secon bier, who pai the sum bi to the sheriff. This secon sale was a revocation, uner authority of the statute, of the first bi; an no act of Johnson’s after that time coul restore him to the rights which he ha lost by refusing to pay the sum bi when calle upon.
The first replication is intene to put in issue the time when the secon sale took place. This we have hel, if true, a mere erroneous exercise of power which i not affect the valiity of the sale. Newton vs. State Bank.
An concee that the State i tener the money bi by Johnson, an claim the benefit of his bi, after the resale of the property, this coul not coaler a right on her to eman a ee for the property; because the bi uner which she claime was abanone by the refusal of the only known bier to pay the sum bi, an because the secon bier ha succeee to all his rights.
The ee subsequently foun in the possession of Johnson, bears ate eight ays after the secon sale of the property, an, if the contents of the ee are to be receive as evience, it must be taken all together, an woul show prima facie a ee signe an elivere to Johnson at that ate. If so, it was an act not warrante by law, an of course woul not be consummate by acknowlegment, by the sanction of a court. Uner the circumstances of the case, after the sale to Newton, the first bier stoo in no better situation than any one else; his bi was forfeite; there was no bi; a mere stranger ha as much right to eman a ee as he ha. But the sheriff positively enies the execution of the ee, an there is no proof of its execution except that arising from presumption: but if there was proof upon this point, it woul not avail.
It is not true, as the counsel for the State seem to suppose that the sheriff may charge himself with the sum bi an ispense with the payment of the money. This question was iscusse at length in the case of Dickson vs. Gillilan, 1 Cow Rep. 498. In that case the sheriff receive a large amount of the money an mae a ee to the junior lien creitor uner the New York statute. The first purchaser, at the expiration of the time allowe him to reeem, claime a ee, an it was orere to be mae to him, upon the groun that the sheriff ha no right to make the ee until the whole of the purchase money was pai. The policy of the law forbis that sheriffs shoul be permitte to substitute themselves as ebtors to the creitor. But even if this was permitte, it is evient that no court woul compel the sheriff to o so. Nor will the reainess of the State to pay authorize a ee after the secon sale, because the sheriff has exhauste his power an authority by a sale, an the receipt of the purchase money uner it.'
Returning theivto. the only question of law raise by the assignment of errors, the amissibility of the eposition as evience, limite in its application to the issues forme upon the replication, to the return of the sheriff on the writ of manamus, we are of opinion that ha it been amitte an ha proven every fact put in issue by the replications, that still upon the whole case, the ecision of the court was right, because the execution of the ee shoul have been before the sale to Newton an upon payment of'the money.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The bill in this case is file to compel the efenants, who are the legatees uner the will of Thomas Dooley, to refun to complainants, the executors of sai estate, so much Of the specific legacies pai over to them as may be necessary to pay $879 42, a balance in favor of the complainants, upon final settlement of the estate.
The efence to these allegations was, not that efenants were not the legatees, or ha not receive the specific legacies; nor was it that no settlement ha been mae with the Probate Court showing that such balance was ue to the complainants. But they attempte to set up in efence against the bill that the settlement mae with the Probate Court was unjust an frauulent, an upon this point have introuce a mass of evience, tening to prove that the complainants ha not charge themselves in settlement with a large amount of money an property, which came to their hans, an for which they were accountable as executors.
Uner the issue thus forme the main question is, as to whether the evience was or not amissible to show a ifferent state of accounts from that presente by the recor. If the efenants ha file a cross bill alleging frau, accient, or mistake in the settlement, an thereby mae a irect issue upon the valiity of the settlement, there is no oubt but that the evience tening to prove such frau might have been amitte: but such was not the case. An as so much of the answers as was intene to present this issue in the nature of a cross bill, was stricken out by emurrer, the simple question arises as to the amissibility of the evience (on a collateral issue) to contraict the recor evience of settlement. This, we think, coul not be one, because it was the recor evience of a settlement mae by a court of competent jurisiction, an must be receive as conclusive evience of the state of accounts an the balance ue, until falsifie by a irect proceeing putting in issue its truth.
It is not sufficient, in orer to amit such evience, to show that the proceeings, uner which the settlement was mae, wei'e ii'regular, as for instance (as in this case) where it, oes not appear that notice was given of the time an place of settlement, as require by the statute. Such ix’regularities may rener the proceeings erroneous an voiable; but until they are avoie, unless absolutely voi, they are entitle to the same creit as if in all respects regular. Boren vs. State use &c., 6 Eng 519.
But the efenants conten that as the settlement in this case was mae uner the territorial statute which oes not eny the right to impeach the settlement when mae, unless by bill in chancery for frau, as our present statute oes, that therefore such settlement may be impeache an falsifie in a collateral proceeing. If this position be true, then in every instance where there is no express statute forbiing it, the truth of a recor might be impeache in a collateral proceeing by extrinsic evience; an the istinction between parol an recor evience broken own. So far from this, in the absence of any statute upon the subject, we o not hesitate, upon general principles of law, to hol that the recor evience of settlement can only be impeache by a irect proceeing in chancery for that purpose. So long as it remains a recor, it is to be hel as conclusive evience of the facts therein containe. It follows, therefore, that the whole of the evience offere in this case to show a ifferent state of accounts from that shown by the recor, was irrelevant an inamissible.
If the efenants ha appeale from the ecision of the court, in sustaining a emurrer to so much of their answer as was in-, tene as a cross bill, the question as to its sufficiency woul have been presente for our consieration; but as they have not complaine of that ecision as error, it becomes unnecessary for us to examine that point. Inee the scope of our inquiry is limite to an enquiry as to the equitable rights of the complainants, upon facts which are, in effect, amitte by the answers to be true, for the enial of the truth of the settlements in effect, amounte to nothing.
The complainants, upon the facts properly amissible uner the issue were clearly entitle to relief, an the Circuit Court erre in ismissing 1heir bill with costs.

The facts in this case are substantially the same as in that of the complainants against the heirs of Thomas Dooly, ecease, ecie at the present term.
Duty an wife are legatees uner the same will, an the suit, as in that case, is brought to compel the efenants to refun a proportionate part of their legacy for the payment of a sum of money pai out by the executors in the settlement of the ebts of the estate.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
Leaving out of view extraneous matters, the material facts, as amitte or proven, on the trial of this cause, appear to be as follows: One Malone mae his writing obligatory for the p&yment of money to Ellis, (the efenant below) ate October 20, 1846, anue six months after ate. On the 12th of June 1847, an after the obligation became ue, Ellis assigne it to one Hough, who, on the 10th of November, 1848, assigne it to Dunham (the plaintiff below). Hough an Dunham, respectively emane payment of Malone,' who i not pay, but when such emans were mae, oes not appear; nor oes it appear that any notice of the emans upon Malone, an his refusal to pay, was given to Ellis, until the ay before the suit was commence, when he was notifie in writing, by Dunham, of such eman an refusal, an that he woul be hel liable upon his assignment. The suit was commence on the 26th ay of April, 1849. The parties live in ajoining counties, the efenant about fifty miles, an Malone about fifteen miles from the plaintiff below. We take the fact, about which there was conflicting testimony, to be foun by the verict, that at the time of the assignment by the efenant to Hough, Malone the obligor was insolvent.
Among the various instructions aske for by both parties, the court, on the motion of the plaintiff, an against the objection of the efenant, charge the jury, to the effect, that if they believe from the evience that Malone, the maker of the bon, was insolvent at the time the assignment of it was mae by Ellis to Hough, the assignment was an original guaranty of the payment of the bon, an the efenant’s liability was fixe instantly, an the assignee was not boun to make eman of payment from Malone an give notice of non-payment, because he woul not be require to o a useless act. Also, that if Ellis assigne the bon after ue, such an enorsement was an original unertaking on his part, that the bon shoul be pai, an that no eman of payment of Malone, or notice of his refusal to pay, was necessary to fix the liability of Ellis."" Also, that the bon being assigne after ue, if they believe that both Hough an the plaintiff emane payment of Malone, an he refuse payment, an that the plaintiff gave the efenant notice of the eman upon the maker, an his refusal, at any time before the commencement of the suit, it was sufficient to fix the efenant’s liability. On the other han the court, at the request of the efenant, refuse to instruct the jury, to the effect that the efenant coul not be mae liable on his assignment, unless the plaintiff ha given him reasonable, or ue notice of non-payment by the obligor : also, that if the jury believe from the evience that the holer use no exertions to collect the note for several years, he thereby ischarge the enorser.
These instructions woul seem to have been given an refuse uner an entire misapprehension of the law. If the plaintiff sought to recover uner what may be calle the ol law of assignments — see Morse vs. Johnson, ecie at January term, 1853, he coul only o so against his immeiate assignor, upon the contract of assignment, by showing that he ha use ue iligence in suing the obligor or party primaiily liable, an in prosecuting him to insolvency, not repute but legal insolvency, evience by ischarge uner the insolvent acts from arrest upon ca. sa., or a return of nulla bona.
But the assignee in this case, in orer to recover against a remote assignor, between whom an himself, there was no privity of contract, must have availe himself of so much of the statute of assignments of 1837, Digest, Title, Assignments, sec. 9, as is introuctory of the law merchant an of its analogous rules.
The bon here being assigne after ue, the nature of the contract is that the enorsement is equivalent to the rawing of a new bill by the enorser upon the maker or obligor, who stans as acceptor of it, in favor of the enorsee, an payable on eman. An in orer to charge the enorser in such case, his contract being conitional upon receiving ue notice of non-payment, as at the law merchant, the assignee or enorsee (for uner this statute they seem to be convertible terms) must use reasonable iligence in presenting the bon or note, to the maker for payment. The time an manner of giving the notice woul be governe by the rules of the law merchant in similar cases. What woul be reasonable iligence in making the eman of payment, might often be a mixe question of law an fact for the jury to etermine, uner the instructions of the court, an accoring. as they may fin the facts proven. But, as hel in Jones vs. Robinson, 6 Eng. 511, the elay of presentment for so great a lapse of time in this case, not explaine or accounte for, amounte to gross negligence, an there being no question about this, as a matter of fact, the court below shoul have charge the jury what the legal conclusion was, viz : that the plaintiff ha faile to use ue iligence. No matter when the eman of payment was mae, it was nugatory an unavailing to charge the assign- or without notice to him of the non-payment, an the case here stans as if there ha been no presentment or eman of payment, until the ay before the suit was brought, nearly two years-after the assignment by the efenant to Hough.
Uner the statute, where the bon, bill or note, is transferre' before ue, the holer, by using ue iligence, may hol liable all or any of the prior parties. But where the transfer is after ue, we apprehen that it is each separate enorsement or assignment, that is equivalent to the rawing of a new bill, unless inee,, all the transfers are mae within the perio of iligence, which the law woul require at the hans of the first assignee; in. other wors, an over ue bon or note, cannot be transferre by various successive enorsements, at istant intervals of time, so as to subject all prior parties in one common liability to the last enorsee, as woul be the case when negotiable paper, payable at a fixe time, is enorse before ue. Supposing it to be law, that if Hough, the first assignee, by a seasonable eman upon the maker for payment, an notice of non-payment to the efenant, his immeiate assignor, ha thus fixe his liability upon the contract of assignment, any subsequent assignment of the bon or note by Hough, woul transfer that liability along with it as a chose in action to a remote assignee, yet it oes not follow that the first assignee of a note, past ue, having faile to fix the liability of his assignor by ue presentment an notice of non-payment, can by an assignment of his own, confer any authority upon a secon assignee, to revive or renew the conitional liability of the first assignor, which, by such neglect ha become ischarge. Uner these circumstances, the plaintifi below, by a prompt eman of payment of the original maker, an notice of non-payment to Hough, his immeiate assignor, might have hel him equally liable with the maker or obligor, an this, we think, woul be giving to the statute quite as liberal an beneficial construction as it is susceptible of: but without changing the whole character of the contract, the eman an notice to Hough woul not make the efenant liable, unless ue notice of eman an refusal ha been given to him. What is ue notice in such case woul be ascertaine by regaring him as the rawer of a sight raft upon the maker, an so any question of reasonable iligence on the part of the payee, or any holer of such raft, woul be etermine as at the law merchant!
It oes not seem necessary to notice any other errors, that might be consiere as appearing on this recor. The jugment will be reverse an the cause remane for trial anew.",legal_case

This, as a general rule,is correct, but as the legal sufficiency of the eclaration has alreay been ecie, (3 Eng. 181,) that ecision will be hel conclusive upon that point. An as the counsel seem to iffer wiely as to the extent to which that ecision will be hel conclusive, it may be well to remark, that it is only conclusive as to the legal sufficiency of the eclaration, as a pleaing, to put the efenant to answer. But nothing is settle with regar to the extent or nature of the efence to be interpose. As regars that, the efenant is left just as if no emurrer ha been interpose to the eclaration.
Whilst this is the case, as regars the issues of fact to be forme, no secon consieration of the eclaration will be permitte upon a emurrer to the subsequent pleaings. The emurrer to the replications oes, however, raise the question as to the sufficiency of the plea to which they were offere as a reply. An, we will pi’ocee at once to consier the plea, because, if it shoul be foun emurrable upon grouns not amenable, it will super-cee the necessity of consiering the questions arising upon the emurrer' to the replications.
The plea' is in bar an sets up a payment or satisfaction by a levy upon the slaves an real estate of Cocke, one of the efenants in the execution, in satisfaction of a statute j ugment, upon the same forthcoming bon, upon which this suit is brought: which levy is averre to be upon property of sufficient value to satisfy such jugment, an to remain in full force an unischarge.
In support of this plea, it is contene that the bon was merge in the statute jugment; an that, as property of sufficient value to satisfy it, is taken an hel in satisfaction, the ebt is-thereby, in fact, satisfie, an a bar to any recovery upon the bon. The plaintiff’s counsel, on the other han, eny that the1 levy is a satisfaction, such as can be plea in bar, or amounts to-more than an abatement or suspension of the right to further satisfaction, until the levy is legally ischarge; an enies that the-bon is merge in the jugment, or by force of the statute loses-its efficacy as a bon. The solution of this latter question is involve in much ifficulty.
Upon the return of the execution unsatisfie, an the bon as-forfeite, the statute gave the right, at once, by operation of law,to sue out an execution against the principal an the.security in, the bon. No formal jugment is pronounce. In this instance it was one upon motion of the plaintiff an leave of court; but-still no formal jugment was renere. It will not o to call the' bon the jugment. It is but the evience of ebt, which, together with the return of the officer thereon, upon which, when; brought into court, by mere force of the statute, there is, in contemplation of law, a jugment existing, though not formally pronounce, nor entere of recor, yet so epenant upon the bon- an the return, as almost necessarily to livein them. For they are' the only recor evience, except the motion for execution an the-orer granting it, of the existence of such jugment. In the case of Ruell against Macgruer, 6 Eng. 584, the nature of this statute jugment was consiere with some care. In that case it was sai, “The non-elivery of the property transforms the bon by operation of law into a statutory jugment, on which statutory jugment, execution may issue against all of the obligors in the bon. The execution oes not issue upon the bon, but upon the statutory jugment, which, by operation of law, springs into being upon the forfeiture, an then exists in contemplation of law.” Ahering to this, as perhaps the best exposition which we can give, an which has been heretofore cite with approbation, we must hol that the jugment exists, not, properly speak ing, in the bon: that is the evience of a ebt, an together with the return, constitutes the founation upon which the statute-jugment rests, an may also be consiere the recor evience of its existence.
Thus consiere, when suit is brought upon the bon, it may be efene against, just as when brought upon any other instrument, upon wiich there has been a recovery ha. For there has been a recovery ha upon this bon, an whether formally pronounce by the court,' an entere upon the recor upon-a given state of .facts, or pronounce by the law upon another given state of facts, eclare to be sufficient, it is still a recovery as full an as complete, in the one case as in the other, an is equally effective in procuring final satisfaction.
We come next to consier the efficacy of the particular efence interpose in this case. Conceing the plea to be in all other respects sufficient an formal, we come at once to the main point. Is an existing unsatisfie levy upon property sufficient in value to satisfy the jugment, such satisfaction as maybe pleae in bar of a recovery. We have repeately hel that such a levy is a satisfaction, but not an absolute satisfaction in any event. It must epen upon circumstances connecte with the future isposition of the levy, whether it is an absolute satisfaction or not. In the application of this rule, where the question ai;ises as to whether further process for satisfaction shoul be suspene until the subsisting levy is ispose of, as in the case of Whiting & Slark, an the more recent case of Trapnall vs. Waterman an Woo, there is comparatively but little ifficulty. The question i not arise upon plea; nor is that the moe of reaching such irregularity. Those cases settle the general principle, that a subsisting unischarge levy upon property, sufficient to satisfy the jugment, is a satisfaction until, by the ischarge of the levy by sale or otherwise, it proves to be partial or incomplete. In those cases the question arose upon the right of the jugment creitor to further process upon his jugment; here the question comes up by plea in bar to another action upon the same eman. A jugment upon this plea in favor of the efenant, woul be a perpetual bar to all further satisfaction, whether the levy shoul or not, upon sale of the property or other legal ischarge, prove to be sufficient: an as this woul be the effect of the jugment on the plea, such plea cannot be allowe, for if allowe, the jugment of the court woul go beyon the legal effect of the matter pleae.
In the case of Humphries vs. Anthony, where an unischarge levy was pleae in bar of a right to revive the jugment, upon which the levy was mae, the insufficiency of the plea was neither iscusse nor ecie. The emurrer was to the replication, an although in consiering the legal sufficiency of the replication, this court might have gone back to consier of the sufficiency of the plea, yet this was not one. The ecision of the court settle alone the question as to the sufficiency oí the replication. The ecision in that case, therefore, is no authority for holing a plea in bar amissible in such cases, but must be limite to the precise point iscusse an ecie.
In a later case, Fowler an Pike vs. Scott, where after issolution of an injunction, an pening an appeal from the ecision of the court issolving it, suit was brought upon the injunction bon, the penency of the appeal, was plea in bar to a recovery upon the bon, the court hel that, although a plea in abatement woul have been the more appropriate plea, yet the efence might be pleae either in bar or abatement. This ecision was mae upon the authority of Bell vs. Chapman, 10 John. Rep. 192, where a plea to the isability of the plaintiff, that he was an alien enemy, (a state of war then existing,) was hel to be well pleae in bar or abatement.
But it will be observe that the subject matter of efence in the last case, was to the isability of the party to sue, an not matter in bar of the recovery as in this case. These ecisions, therefore, amitting the law to have been correctly ecie, uner the particular state of the case presente, o not conflict with :our opinion in this case. We are satisfie that the efence set up in this plea cannot be plea in bar of the action; an whether the replications were sufficient in law or not, as the sufficiency of the plea was properly raise by the emurrer to the replications, the emurrer shoul have been overrule.
As this efence, accoring to our view of the law, is entirely cut off, so that the question cannot again arise in the court below, it becomes unnecessary to iscuss the merits of the replications. A ba replication is sufficient for a ba plea.
Let the jugment be reverse an the case remane to be proceee in accoring to law an not inconsistent with this opinion.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The complainant by his bill alleges that the efenants an himself entere into an agreement of co-partnership for the purpose of erecting a am an saw mill, upon a certain tract- of lan then belongiug to the government, but which was to be entere by them in tKeir joint names, each partner avancing his equal portion of the purchase money, All the partners were to ai in constructing the mill, an an account was to be kept of the work one, materials furnishe, an money expene by each. The complainant being a mill-wright, was to o an superinten that portion of the work. That in case either partner shoul become issatisfie by the time the mill was put into operation, or before, he shoul not then be consiere a partner any longer, but shoul be pai what was ue him by the concern. That the parties proceee with the erection of the mill an am, in which the complainant was engage uring several months, when he iscovere that one of the efenants, with the privity of the other, ha gone to the istrict lan office, an claime an obtaine a pre-emption right to the tract of lan on which the mill was situate, thereby preventing for the term of one year, the entry of it, pursuant to their agreement, an the efenants then refuse to recognize him as a partner, an force him to abanon the work. That besies his labor bestowe in assisting to erect the mill, he ha expene various small sums of money of which an account was exhibite. That he was entitle as a partner, to one-thir share in the mill, an praye for iscovery, an an account an settlement of the partnership affairs, that the property might be sol an the procees ivie amongst the partners accoring as the amount ue to each might be ascertaine.
The efenants, in their answer, profess to annex an setforth by way of exhibit, an account of the labor an money expene by them in erecting the mill, an also an account of moneys owing to them by the complainant, but no such exhibits appear in the transcript before us. But in orer to reach what seems to be the only question presente in the case, it will be sufficient to state, that the answer an the epositions taken on both sies isclose substantially the following facts. That there was a verbal agreement to erect the mill an enter thelan in partnership, though iffering in several respects from that allege by the complainant. That the complainant i expen some money, an work at intervals an inifferently well uring several months. That the efenants loge in the lan office, a claim to a preemption right upon the tract in question, not with any esign to efrau the complainant, but to prevent any other person from entering it, an until such time as the partners coul spare the money to enter it, an that the transaction was so explaine to the complainant. • That the complainant quit work an abanone the partnership without any just cause for issatisfaction an against the wishes of the efenants,, who requeste him to continue. That the work one by the complainant was of some value to the efenants, who remaine in possession of the property, an when the complainant left the mill in an unfinishe state, hire another mill-wright an went on to complete it.
Upon the hearing, the court below ismisse the bill for want of equity, an upon the whole case, the appellant has no right to complain of the ecree, so far as it enies to him any right as a partner to an interest in the specific property. But it oes appear that something is ue to him from the efenants, or at least, that he is equitably entitle to have an account taken, an a ecree in his favor, for what may be foun to be justly ue, an upon the statement of such account, both parties will be at liberty to make proof of their emans.
The abanonment by the complainant of the unertaking worke a issolution of the copartnership, but there was nothingin his conuct from which any frauulent esign to obtain an unfair avantage of his copartners, which woul work a total forfeiture of his rights, can be inferre. He left them in possession of the partnership property, an the avails of his labor in an unfinishe, but not useless state. Unlike the efenant in Harvey vs. Howell, 5 Ark. 270, whose conuct the court then thought a fit subject for animaversion, the complainant here i not engage in any business hostile to the interests of the partnership, or o anything inconsistent with it beyon his capricious abanonment of the unertaking, which i not hiner them from prosecuting it to completion!
The cause will be remane with instructions to the court below to irect an account to be taken of the amount ue to the complainant for his work an services, materials furnishe or money expene about the erection of the am an mill, supposing him to have been employe by the efenants for that purpose, an after eucting therefrom in the way of compensation such amount as he may have receive from the efenants, to ecree that they pay him the resiue, if any, which he will take in lieu of any interest he might have ha in the partnership property, or the profits arising from it.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of replevin in the cepit for a slave. The* efenant pleae non cepit; property in himself in right of his-wife, in right of his wife jointly with plaintiff, in right of his wife jointly with a thir person, in right of his wife jointly with the-plaintiff an others, an also property in a thir person; in each-of them traversing the plaintiff’s title.
To each of these pleas the plaintiff file two replications. In-his secon replication-, without setting up an absolute title, or right of property, or possession in himself, he replie that he ha title to the slave as one of the heirs of Laura Ann Brashaw, an J. also, as one of the heirs of Sarah McGinnis, an also as legatee uner the will of Sarah McGinnis, an that before an at the time when, &c., he was in peaceable possession of the slave, with the assent of Wooruff, the executor of sai will.
To these replications the efenants emurre, an the court,, upon consieration, sustaine the emurrer, an this ecision is-assigne as error an will be first consiere.
The several pleas, except the sixth plea, set up title in the e-fenant, or in the efenant jointly with others, an each con-elues with a traverse of the plaintiff’s title to the property. The-injustice of the caption, which is the gist of the action, is by these-pleas avoie, b3r showing that the efenant ha a right to take the property. »
The material fact put in issue is property in the efenant, an consequently the replication must sustain the title, not the mere possessory title, but the absolute title. It is true that possession by the plaintiff an a wrongful taking by the efenant will entitle the plaintiff in the first instance to maintain his action, but when, as Baron Gilbert says, (Treatise on the law of Replevin 132) the efenant pleas property in himself, he avois the injustice of the caption, which is the gist of the action, by showing that he ha a right to take it. To such plea the plaintiff replies, not merely a possessory title, unless connecte with such facts as woul show a right of ominion an control, even against him who has the legal title; but he must reply such facts as show title in himself. The case of Rogers vs. Arnol, 12 Wen. Rep. 36, is very strongly in point. The action was replevin, for taking mill irons; pleas, non cepit, property in efenants an another; property in themselves as tenants in common with the plaintiff; property in themselves as tenants in common with the plaintiff an another; property in themselves; an property in one of them. When consiering the effect of these pleas, the court sai “ All these pleas are obviously foune upon the principle applicable to"" this action, that the plaintiff, as in trover, must recover upon the strength of his title to, or property in the goos in question.” An again, upon the same question, the court sai “ It is a goo plea in this action that the property is in the plaintiff an the efenant, or a stranger; an where there are two plaintiffs, it is in one of them. Here it is shown to be in the plaintiff an one of the efenants, which isproves the issues in the case, that the plaintiff is the exclusive owner. It is not material that the efenant shoul prove title to the property, as set forth in any one plea, as that is only inucement to the-traverse of the plaintiff’s title, as has been before shown, an nee not be, an was not enie in the replication. Upon the issue the plaintiff was boun to prove an maintain an exclusive right to the possession an control of the property.”
This ecision is well sustaine by numerous authorities, an from the principle lai own it follows, that as the plaintiff, uner such issue, is boun to prove an exclusive right to possession an control, which can only exist where he has the absolute title an exclusive title to the property, or hols uner one who has such title, he must, when he replies to such plea, set up matter which, if proven, woul uphol an sustain his right to an exclusive right of possession an control of the property. This, we think, the replications fail to o. They neither assert an exclusive right of possession in the plaintiff, nor in one uner whom he hel possession, but assert a joint property in the slave as heir of certain iniviuals, an uner the will of one of them as legatee, an that they ha possession, with the assent of the executor of the will of one of the two, uner whom plaintiff an efenants set up title. This clearly gave no right to an exclusive possession, because it only showe a joint tenancy, or a tenancy in common with others.
Littleton says, “ If two be possesse of chattels personal in common by ivers titles, as of a horse, or ox, or cow, if one takes the whole to himself, out of the possession of the other, the other hath no remey, but to take this from him, who hath one him the wrong to occupy in common, &c., when he can see his time, &c.” An Lor Coke, commenting thereon, says, “ If one tenant in common take all the chattels personal, the other hath no remey by action, but he may take them again. Co. Litt. 200 a. An to this effect is the ecision of the court in Rogers vs. Arnol, 12 Wen. 30, an McElerry vs. Flannagan, 1 Har. & Gill, 308. An this question was expressly ecie in Robinson vs. Calloway, 4 Ark. Rep. 95.
The replications to the several pleas setting up property in the efenant, or in the efenant with others, were insufficient, an the emurrer to them correctly sustaine.
As regars the 6th plea, which sets up title in Wooruff, as executor of the will of Sarah McGinnis — if the plaintiff ha replie a special property an right of possession uner Wooruff, we are not prepare to say that such replication woul not have been goo; but we cannot consier the replication as relying upon a hire, or right of possession erive through any contract for a limite estate in the slave, but as showinghow he acquire possession uner his title as heir an legatee; an consequently the replication to this plea was also insufficient, an the emui’rer to it properly sustaine.
The next question is as to the amissibility, as evience, of a paper purporting to be a bill of sale to Sarah Brashaw, for her chilren, Sarah an Laura, through whom the efenants claim title to the slave. The paper offere in evience purporte to be a copy of the recor of a bill of sale to Sarah Brashaw for her infant chilren, recore in the office of the Parish Juge, an is certifie by him as a true copy from the recors in his office ; to which is appene the certificate of the Governor of Louisiana, that James J. Weems, who certifie the copy, was, at the time of signing the same, Parish Juge, for the Parish of West Feliciana, in sai State : that his signature is genuine, an that faith an creit are ue to his official acts as such.
The bill of sale purports to have been taken before Joseph Bernar, a notary public for the Parish of Feliciana, in sai State, an was no otherwise proven or authenticate as the act of the parties. To the reaing of this paper the plaintiff objecte, an thereupon the efenant, as a founation for reaing sai paper writing in evience, an against the objection of the plaintiff, prouce a pamphlet entitle “ Acts passe at the first session of the 14th Legislature of the State of Louisiana, begun an hel in the city of New Orleans, January 7th, 3 839.” An for the same purpose, against the objection of the plaintiff, prouce a book with a title page, as follows : “Civil Coe of the State of Louisiana, with annotations by Wheelock S. Upton, L. L. D., an Neil R. Jennings. By authority. New Orleans. E. Johnson & Co. Stationers’Hall, 1838.” Upon the prouction of this act an civil coe, or that which purporte to be the Civil Coe of Louisiana, an uner authority of the contents thereof, the court overrule the objection, both to the reaing of the pamphlet acts an the civil coe, an also to the amissibility of the paper purporting to be a copy of the recor of sai Parish court, an permitte the same to be rea to the jury as evience.
By the 2 section, ch. 66, Dig. stat. p. 490, it is provie, “That the printe statute books of the several States an Territories of the Unite States, purporting to have been printe uner the authority of such State or Territory, shall be evience of the legislative acts of such States or Territories.” Uner this statute we perceive no objection to the introuction of the act passe at the session of 1839, on account of the eviences of its authenticity, as an act of the Louisiana legislature. But then it cannot be sai to be authority for making the paper offere in evience matter of recor; because the act is prospective, an was passe some fifteen years or more after the ate an recor entry of the paper offere in evience. Nor can the pamphlet offere as the civil coe come in ai of this act; because it i not purport to be a statute book of the State of Louisiana, printe uner the authority of that State, nor i it appear to have been aopte by any act of the Legislature of the State as a coe of laws of the State. The act touching this civil coe only authorize the Governor to purchase, for the use of the State, one thousan copies of a new eition of the civil coe of Louisiana, propose to be publishe by E. Johns & Go., provie that the Governor shoul be satisfie with the manner in which the Work shoul be one, an further, that sai eition shall be carefully collate with the original manuscript, &c. Now there is no evience whatever, that the pamphlet offere was one of Johns & Go’s», new eition of the civil coe, or that it ever was examine, compare, or approve by the Governor, or that he was satisfie with the manner in which it was one. An even if all this ha appeare, there is no provision in the act for aopting this as part of'the coe of laws of the State of Louisiana, or of the laws heretofore existing. It simply provies for the purchase of a thousan copies for the use of the State. The court below erre, therefore, in permitting the pamphlet; purporting to be the civil coe of Louisiana, to be rea.
Returning to the paper offere as a copy of the recor, It is evL ent that it was inamissible as evience, because it was neither shown to be acknowlege before any officer competent to take such acknowlegment, an was sprea upon the recor of the Parish court without authority of law. In the case of Wilson vs. Royston, 2 Ark. 328, the authentication of the ee by acknowlegement before a notary public, with certificate, as well as that of the Governor of the State, showing that the notary was uly commissione, &c.; was hel insufficient evience to authorize the reaing of the ee in evience in this State.
We think, uner the circuinstances of the case, that the court below erre in permitting the paper, purporting to be a bill of sale, an tening in connection with other evience to prove title in the efenant, or thir persons, to be rea in evience to the jury. An for this error the jugment an ecision of the Circuit Court must be reverse, an the cause remane for further proceeings therein, to be ha accoring to law, an not inconsistent with this opinion.

elivere the opinion of the Court.,
This is an action of replevin brought by the appellees against the appellants, for the wrongful taking of slaves. The efenants file two pleas, non cepit an property in themselves, as the executors of the last will an testament of Freerick Notrebe, ecease. By written consent an agreement, an agree statement of the facts was submitte to the court as a special verict.
The facts or special verict is substantially this: John Baptiste Bellette an his wife, Elizabeth Bellette resie with, or in the immeiate vicinity of Freerick Notrebe, (who ha marrie their aughter,) for twenty-five years, an uring that time, an prior to the 17th of July, 1835, the sai John Baptiste ha renere services to sai Freerick, in the management of his business. In consieration of which an one ollar, on the ay last aforesai, the sai Freerick, by ee in fee simple, conveye to the sai John Baptiste, two lots of lan in the village of Arkansas. An at the same time, by a separate ee, for the same consieration, he grante, bargaine, an sol to the sai John Baptiste, five negro slaves, who with their incréase, are the slaves now in suit, as his absolute property an estate- An on the same ay, sai Notrebe also execute to the sai Bellette’the following instrument, to wit: “Know all men by these presents, that I, Freerick Notrebe, of the Post of Arkansas, Territory an county of Arkansas, eclare to whom it may concern, that my father-in-law, John B. Bellette (alias Enselma) renere me services 25 years, an by his care, economy an continue assiuity to protect my interests, has been an aitional han to help me in accumulating an saving some property. An in consequence a remuneration from me to him, is only just an equitable, an without any cause whatever prejuicial to my chilren, I am willing, an by these presents, o will that my sai father-in-law be inepenent in his ol age from the caprice of my sai chilren, an for these reasons alone, (not incluing many others of some weight) an in case I ie before him, as Go an Provience best knows, I wish an inten, that he shall take out of my estate, before any ivien be mae by my chilren, or their representatives, the sum of three thousan ollars, in lawful money, or the equivalent in property at a fair valuation, at his option; an I absolutely will an orer that my heirs, executors, or aministrators shall truly an honestly execute this act, as a legitimate compensation ue to the sai J. B. Bellette, the father of my ear an belove wife, Felicite. I also wish an inten, that shoul my mother-in-law, Elizabeth Bellette, o service to my sai father-in-law an myself, then, that she will receive the legal interest of the sai onation of $3,000, for her lifetime, an request my chilren to a any surplus, (if they are able) to give her a full competency, an to rener her happy. The house an the slaves given to my father-in-law, by two instruments of wi'iting, bearing the same ate as this one, will be also her property for life, an shall have an keep possession, to enjoy.it as her own property.”
These three instruments were uty execute an elivere to the sai Bellette, in whose hans they remaine until his eath; until which time the female slaves continue in his possession an exclusivé use, an the males also, or others in their place. Notrebe, uring the lifetime of Bellette, set up no claim to the slaves, but on the contrary, amitte the title to be in Bellette, by offering to buy or swap for one of them. He i, however, pay taxes on them in his own name. The families (Notrebe an Bellette’s) live pretty much as one family, though occupying ifferent builings. Notrebe furnishe provisions for both. Bellette ie in possession of the slaves in 1838. After his eath Mrs. Bellette occupie a room in the same house with Notrebe as a member of his family. In 1843 or 1844 Notrebe enie Mrs. Bellette’s right to the property. In 1843 he mae his will, the tenth article of which is as follows: “Having alreay given as a gift by a ee, an a bill of sale uner ate of July the 17th, 1835, some property an slaves to the late John B. Bellette, (alias Enselma) my father-in-law, which has not been expene by him in his lifetime, the same property is to be revertible as a life estate to his wiow, Elizabeth Bellette, my mother-in-law, an having also secure to the sai late John B. Bellette ecease, by an instrument of writing, uner ate July 17th, 1835, a sum of three thousan ollars in property, at fair valuation, to be receive from my estate after my ecease, if in nee of it, now the same clause is also in favor of, an revertible to the sai Elizabeth Bellette, my mother-in-law, an my absolute will an esire are, that this promise be effecte after my ecease, if she is in want, an to be fulfille to the last point. An I recommen my belove wife, an my two heirs, John an Mary, to continue to cherish her in her ol age, an to treat her well in procuring my mother-in-law as goo a maintainance as circumstances will enable my wife an two heirs, John an Mary, for their goo ol mother an granmother.”
In 1849, Notrebe ie, leaving his wife an mother-in-law, the plaintiffs in this suit, who uner the facts above, claim jointly the slaves in controversy. The efenants on the other han, claim the slaves as the executors of the last will of Mr. Notrebe.
The court below upon the agree facts, or special verict eclare the law to be in favor of the plaintiffs an renere jugment accoringly. From which ecision, uner the special reservation of exception in the submission of the facts to the court, the efenant excepte, an by appeal has brought the-case before us for ecision.
There is in this case no question as to facts, they having been ascertaine an agree upon, an we are calle upon to eclare the law which arises upon them.
At the outset it is contene by the appellant, that the three first instruments bearing the same ate an mae touching the same subject matter, shoul be taken as one instrument; an that as the latter was testamentary in its character, the others must follow it, an thereby they shoul all be so consiere. It is true that these several instruments werebetween the same parties, an were eviently intene for atwo-fol common purpose: to provie means for the present comfort an inepenent support of an age relative, an also, in case of contingency to provie for further support after the eath of the obligor or onor. The present wants of Mr. Bellette were supplie by an absolute ee for a house, an slaves to wait upon an work for him. The first two instruments, absolute an unconitional, effecte this; an although there is manifeste throughout a praiseworthy solicitue on the part of Mr. Notrebe to provie for his father-in-law, above all care for remuneration, still it is expressly amitte by him, an we must so consier it, that these instruments were mae upon a full an valuable consieration. They are neither gifts nor legacies, but ees of sale upon valuable consieration, not to take effect at a future ay, but instantly, an which, in this instance, was followe up by the actual possession an enjoyment of the property. Mr. Notrebe amitte the property to be Mr. Billette’s until after his eath, an after that time, as we shall presently see, he might well have asserte claim to the property. The thir instrument, it is true, relates to the same subject matter, an although that too, is acknowlege to be upon full consieration, an only what is ue, it is mae to epen upon two contingencies; first, the eath of Mr.- Notrebe, an seconly, the pecuniary circumstances of Mr. Bellette. Amitting the testamentary character of this instrument in several leaing particulars, we are not of opinion it can raw to it the other two instruments an efeat their obvious intent an legal effect.
If we were permitte to consier these as voluntary gifts, without other consieration than the respect an regar of Mr. Notrebe for his father-in-law, an a sense of uty to provie for him the means of support, after he, by his eath, shoul be no longer permitte to o so, then the argument of counsel an authorities cite, to which we have given attentive consieration, woul have their full force an application, but these instruments evience a sale of property to pay a ebt, a ebt amitte by Mr. Notrebe, an therefore conclusive upon him. By the force an effect of each of them, a perfect title veste in Mr. Bellette, which no subsequent act of Mr. Notrebe coul efeat. If the effect of the thir instrument, as contene for, is to constitute these three instruments one, an to make them all testamentary, then Mr. Notrebe woul have ha an unquestionable right to revoke them at pleasure uring his life. But surely it cannot be contene that a bill of sale vesting an absolute title in slaves, upon full an valuable consieration coul, after its execution, be revoke; an yet such must be the consequence, if the argument of counsel be correct. The very nature of these instruments forbis that they shoul be consiere testamentary. In the case of Habergham vs. Vincent, 2 Ves. Jr. 204, the ee was execute after the will, mae in reference to it, an coul only exist in it: whatever title passe was in reference to the will. Here the bill of sale was at the same ate, upon full consieration, an coul well exist an take effect without reference to the thir instrument. We are satisfie that the slaves passe to Mr. Bellette, an were hel by him as his absolute property, an at his eath, became the property of Mr. Notrebe, by virtue of his marriage with the aughter an sole heir of Mr. Bellette, subject to the ower interest of his wife, Mrs. Elizabeth Bellette. At the eath of Mr. Notrebe, uner the provisions of the tenth article of his will, Mr. Bellette acquire a life estate in the slaves. Of course, as Mr. Notrebe hel them subject to her ower interest, he coul only convey by will such interest as he ha, which when taken in connection with her ower interest veste in her an absolute estate for life.
We have not overlooke the statute, sec. 56, Dig. ch. 4, which exempts property acquire by the wiow from sale,to pay ebts, &c., but that statute coul not in our opinion affect the right of the husban to sell or evise the estate.
This being our conclusion, it follows, that Mrs. Notrebe has no present interest or estate in the slaves an was improperly mae a party plaintiff in the suit.
Mrs. Bellette’s right as evisee veste at the eath of Mr. Notrebe, but the question is, can she assert such right by action at law against the executor. We shoul think not; at least until the ebts are pai, or time allow'e for paying them, because she takes her title uner the will, subject to the payment of ebts, an the estate passes into the hans of the executor in the first place to satisfy ebts. Upon this point we have been referre to several authorities, which we think quite satisfactory. Anrews vs. Hunneman. 6 Pick. Rep. 129. Toller's Ex. 306. Lynch vs. Thomas, 3 Leigh 682, settle the question as to the right of the executor to hol the property in the first instance for the payment of ebts. The right of the legatee to his legacy is suspene, until by the assent of the executor or the lapse of time, for the settlement of the estate, this suspension is remove. Thus in Mississippi, where A. bequeathe a slave to B., which was in B’s possession at the testator’s eath, it was hel that the executor might recover hire for the perio of one year after the grant of letters testamentary, he having until that time to examine into an settle the estate. King vs. Cooper, Walker's Miss. Rep. 389.
Replevin is a possessory action, an the plaintiff, in orer to maintain it, must have at the commencement of his suit, a right to the possession. Uner the circumstances of this case, it is consistent with the rights of the parties an the evience, to suppose that the slaves w'ere, at the time of Mr. Notrebe’s eath, in. the possession of either Mrs. Bellette or himself. They both live together; the slaves ha been up to the eath of Mr. Bellette, in his possession, an after his eath became by operation of law, the joint property of Mr. Notrebe as heir, in right of his wife, an of Mrs. Bellette as the wiow entitle to ower. If, after the eath of Mr. Notrebe, she retaine an possese herself of the slaves, an the estate of Mr. Notrebe was clearly sufficient to pay his ebts without rawing upon specific legacies, then slight circumstances might be sufficient from which to infer assent; such as continue acquiescence by the executor in her possession, after time ha been allowe to examine into the conition of the estate. How this was, the facts as agree upon o not show.
In view, therefore, of the whole case, without unertaking to say, from the facts before us, whether Mrs. Bellette might or not have maintaine her action in replevin for the recovery of the slaves in her own right, it is very clear that no action coul be maintaine by Mrs. Bellette an Mrs. Notrebe jointly, because, as we have seen, Mrs. Notrebe ha neither title nor right of possession to the slaves.
The court below therefore erre in eciing the question of law arising upon the agree facts or special verict, in favor of the right of the plaintiffs jointly to maintain their action, an in renering jugment thereon for the plaintiffs.
Let the jugment be reverse an set asie.

elivere the opinion of the court.
This suit was commence on the 6th ay of September, 1849, on a promissory note mae by the efenants, together with Thomas J. Lacy, an G. N. Causin, ate 24th February, 1843, an payable to the plain tiff one year after ate. It will be necessary to state only so much of the pleaings an evience as will show istinctly the questions presente on the recor.
The efenants severally, pleae that the cause of action ha not accrue within three years next before the commencement of the suit. The plaintiff replie that on the 23 ay of September, 1845, Lacy, the principal ebtor, mae a partial payment upon the note to the plaintiff, an on the 26th ay of February, 1848, an within three years from the time of such payment, the plaintiff commence suit in tlie Pulaski Circuit Court, upon the note, against all the makers, the alias summons, issue in which suit, was serve upon the present efenants, an not serve upon the other efenants, Lacy an Causin, who ha eparte this life; an in the progress of that suit, the efenant, Fowler, having file his plea in abatement of the alias writ of summons, the plaintiff emurre to the plea, an the emurrer being submitte the court, there, on the 23 ay of June, 1849, overrule the emurrer, an Hie plaintiff eclining to reply to sai plea, an electing to rest on her sai emurrer, the court then an there ajuge that the efenants go hence without ay, an recover of the plaintiff their costs in that behalf expene, as woul appear by the-recor, &c., an that afterwars, on the Cth ay of September, 1849, an within one year after the sai last mentione jugment, the plaintiff commence the present suit against these efenants.
To this replication the efenants severally emurre, because5 it i not appear that the plaintiff ha suffere a non suit in the5 former action, so as to bring her within the saving clause of the5 statute. These emurrers being overrule, the efenant, Pike,, reste; an Fowler rejoine, 1st, enying the fact of part payment by Lacy ; 2, that there was no such recor of the former suit as allege in the replication.
Upon the trial of the issues to Fowler’s rejoiners, it appeare; to the court that there was such a recor. But, in-orer to prove5 the fact of the part payment by Lacy, the Bank offerre in evience her books, kept at the time by A. E. Thornton, her Financial Receiver, or Cashier, in liquiation, proving in connection therewith, that Thornton was such receiver on the 2 of September, 1845, an ha the charge an custoy pf the books, recors,, accounts an notes of the Bank: that he ha left Arkansas after the institution of the present suit, an about a year previous to the trial; that he ha gone to parts unknown, an that since his eparture, he ha been an was beyon the process an jurisiction of this court. The books of the Bank showe the part payment by Lacy, at the time allege in the replication, the entry being as prove, in the han-writing of Thornton in the blotter, an poste by him into the leger. The court below exclue the Bank books an the proofs offere in connection therewith, as being incompetent evience.to prove the partial payment allege to have been mae by Lacy, an jugment went against the Bank, to reverse which she prosecutes this writ of error.
In the case of the State Bank vs. Magness, 6 Eng. 343, the plaintiff replie to the plea of the statute, that in a former action for the same cause, she was non-suit an sue again within the year; an the recor offere in support of this replication showe a jugment ismissing the suit, because the plaintiff, being-rule to file a bon for cost, faile to o so. The court there hel that the ismissal was, in effect a non-suit, an within the perview of the saving clause in the statute, an we are satisfie of the correctness of the ecision upon the facts of that case. But the opinion there woul seem to go to the length of holing, that wherever the plaintiff is not preclue by a ecision upon the merits from bringing another action, he comes within the meaning of the exception in the statute for limiting actions, an may bring a new suit within a year.
It is universally true, wherever it can be shown, accoring to the rules of law, that the merits of a suit have not been passe upon or etermine, the plaintiff is not estoppe by the ajuication, but may have a fresh action. This principle oes not etermine the plaintiff’s right to suspen or avoi the bar of the statute by suing again within the year, because that woul be giving an effect to the term “non-suit,” not warrante by any ajuge cases, an which the statute coul not have contemplate.
So, on the other han, it is true, that in orer for a plaintiff to have the benefit of this saving in the statute, it is not necessary that there shoul be a formal or technical jugment of non-suit. The plaintiff may iscontinue as to a part of the efenants, or he may suffer a iscontinuance of the action as to all, or he may ismiss, or submit to a ismissal of his suit. But in all such cases, wherever the proceeing of the court is equivalent to a non-suit, for the purpose of extening the time for bringing a fresh action, the iea is, that the plaintiff goes out of court voluntarily, or submits to the orer of the court requiring him to o so; an the court oes not ajuicate the cause, so that there is no final jugment to which a writ of error will lie, because the party cannot reverse a proceeing which he has sought or acquiesce in.
In this State, the non-suit, or a ismissal, or iscontinuance, ■ which is equivalent to it, must of necessity, be voluntary. It is settle here—see Martin an Van Horn vs Webb, 5 Ark. 72, ever since ahere to — that the plaintiff cannot, upon any avice or interposition of the court, be compelle to take a non-suit: but he has the right to insist that the court shall procee with his cause, an ajuicate it for or against him, an for no other conceivable object than to have final jugment given, to which he may prosecute his writ of error, if he choose to complain of the proceeings.
In the case now uner consieration, the plaintiff, when her emurrer to the plea in abatement of the writ in the former suit was overrule, ha the right to reply to the plea, if she thought proper to test the truth of it, or submitting to the emurrer to have sue out an alias writ, an so kept the same suit continuously on foot—see King vs. The State Bank, at January term, 1853 — or taken a non-suit, an accoring to the reason of the statute, a voluntary ismissal of the action woul have the same effect, in orer to enable her to sue again within the year. But when she electe to rest on her emurrer an procee no further, an so force the court to rener final jugment in favor of the efenants, it was an election on her part not to suffer a non-suit, but to take the chances of a reversal on error. A party thus situate, might not, inee, prosecute his writ of error, but rather choose to bring a new action, which he coul well o, because not preclue by any ajuication upon the merits. But the ajuication in question woul not, for that reason, be any the less final, an we coul not hol it to be a jugment of non-suit, without, at the same time, holing that a writ of error woul lie to a jugment of non-suit. Upon the principle contene for by the plaintiff in error, wherever a plaintiff eclines to amen, an final jugment goes upon emurrer sustaine to the eclaration, he woul come within the saving of the statute, as if having suffere a non-suit, because there was no such jugment as preclue another action, if rightly brought for the same cause.
We conclue therefore that there is no error in the jugment here, because the replication an the recor offere in proof of it, fail to show such a jugment of non-suit as woul avoi the bar set up in the plea.
It was, moreover, necessary for tbe plaintiff, in orer to avoi tbe bar, to couple the payment allege to have been mae by Lacy, with the former suit. Even if the court below erre in rejecting the evience offere to prove this payment, the jugment woul nevertheless, upon the whole recor, have to be affirme. But as to the proof of part payment no substantial ifference is perceive between this case an The State Bank vs. Barber et al. 7 Eng. 775, an no goo reason is shown why the ecision there ought not to he followe.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The appellant, who was the plaintiff below, moves for leave to ismiss his appeal after the submission of the cause in this court. No recognizance for stay of execution wasentere into in the court below. It follows from the ecision in Clay vs. Notrebe, 6 Eng. 336, that the right of appeal given in common law cases* is a cumulative remey to that by prosecuting a writ of error* both ientical in their operation an esign for the correction of errors. Ree vs. Latham, 1 Ark. 71, State Bank vs. Conway, at January term, 1853. So, the practice has been to treat the privilege of obtaining an orer, allowing an appeal in chancery causes, by application to ,the Supreme Court, or one of the juges, within a year from the renition of the ecree, as cumulative to the right to have an appeal grante in the court below, uring the term at which the ecree was renere. So that a party praying an appeal in the court below, but failing to prosecute it, may yet sue error at any time within three years, in a common law case, or obtain an appeal in a chancery cause, when reasonable grouns for its allowance appear, by application within the year to the Supreme Court.
Where recognizance has been entere into to stay execution, the appellant or plaintiff in error, ismissing his suit, woul subject himself to an affirmance by the opposite party, on prouction of a transcript, as provie by the statute, or to an action on the recognizance. An where there has been a recognizance* this court, after it has obtaine control of the cause, might well refuse to allow a ismissal of it in all cases where, in its iscretion, amages ought to be impose upon affirmance; because if the appeal taken in the court below appear to have been for elay, the appellant will not be allowe to escape the consequen* ces, after having receive the benefit of the elay.
But giving the statute that construction which woul make it most beneficial, where the execution of the jugment has not been suspene or supersee, no reason short of a manifest esign to vex an harrass the opposite party, ought .to eprive the appellant, or plaintiff in error, of what we conceive to be his right, to ismiss, at his own costs, his appeal or writ of error; an which he may renew at any time within the perio limiting the right to bring error.

elivere the opinion of the Court.-
More, the plaintiff below, brought his action of covenant against-Pike an Newton, upon an obligation execute by them, on the 1st of April, 1846, the material portion of which is as follows:’ “Whereas Elijah A. More an Absalom Fowler, Esqs., have this ay mutually execute an instrument of compromise to settle certain claims, ues an emans, in favor of sai More, wherefor,we Albert Pike an Thomas W. Newton,together with Charles P. Bertran an John R. Desha, are securities of sai Fowler, the stipulations of which compromise being complie with by sai Fowler, by or on thp first ay of May next, sai claims an emans will be fully settle, an we an sai two securities ischarge; an on failure, ecree will be entere in accorance with the prayer of the bill of sai More, now pening in Pulaski Circuit Court. Now we plege ourselves to sai More an covenant, an agree,, that in case sai Fowler complies with sai stipulations, an we are so release, we, an sai other securities, will pay such fee as Ringo an Trapnall may charge sai More for their services in prosecuting sai bill.”
The eclaration avers that-on the 1st ay of May, 1846, sai Fowler i, accoring to its stipulations, comply with the terms of sai compromise agreement, an the sai efenants with their co-securities, were thereby release from their liability as such securities for sai Fowler, to the plaintiff, whereby accoring to their sai covenant with the plaintiff, the efenants became an are liable to pay the fee of sai Ringo an Trapnall for prosecuting sai bill, to wit, the sum of two hunre an fifty ollars, with breach that the efenants, although often requeste, &c., ha not pai the same.
The efenants emurre to the eclaration, because it i not allege that they knew of Fowler’s compliance with the compromise agreement; or that they ha notice of the amount of the fee, or that any eman was mae upon them to pay it. The emurrer being overrule, Newton pleae, 1st, that Fowler i not, on the first ay of May next after the ate of the covenant, comply with the stipulations of the compromise agreement, an the securities were not release from the ebts of his referre to: •2, that Ringo an Trapnall i not charge the plaintiff any fee whatever, an were not entitle to any in the cause mentione. Demurrer was sustaine to the secon plea, an the plaintiff replie to the ih’st plea, by way of estoppel, in si.bstance, that the efenant ought not to be amitte to plea the same, &c., because in the progress of the suit referre to, in the Pulaski Circuit Court, in which the plaintiff was complainant, an Fowler an his sai securities were efenants, to enforce the payment of the same ebts an emans, which were the subject of the compromise agreement, an to which the covenant here sue upon ha reference, on the 8th of May, 1846, the same came on to be hear on bill, answers, exhibits an the agreements, an amissions of both the complainant an the efenants in open court mae, an it being amitte that Fowler i, on the 1st of May, 1846, pay the sum of money require, thereby complying' with the compromise agreement in the covenant mentione, it was, by the court there, among other things, ecree that the efenants, Newton an Pike, together with the other securities,. Bertran an Desha, be forever release an ischarge from all responsibility to the plaintiff, as the securities of Fowler, in respect of the ebts an emans in question.
Newton’s emurrer to the replication was overrule, an the efenant’s eclining to plea further, the plaintiff ha jugment, an for his amages assesse upon enquiry.
Our opinion is, that upon all the points, the law is with the plaintiff in the court below. The object of the agreement of compromise was the release of Fowler an his securities: connecte with that agreement was the covenant of the securities, that in case Fowler complie with the terms of the compromise, so as to release them, they woul pay such fee as the complainant’s solicitors might charge him for their services in prosecuting the suit then pening, to enforce payment of the liabilities from which they were to be release. Clearly, the efenants were boun to take notice whether Fowler complie with the terms of the compromise, so as to perfect it. Nor o we think they were entitle to be notifie of the amount of the fee, which the complain-, ant’s solicitors charge; because they took upon themselves the obligation to pay it, an the means of ascertaining the amount were not peculiarly within the knowlege or control of the plains tiff, but was to be ascertaine from the solicitors, a source of information equally accessible to both parties. As they i not choose to stipulate for the amount, they stoo in no worse com ition than the piaintff himself, who was liable without any spe-, cial request, an were boun to pay such reasonable fee as the solicitors eserve to have, such as they might agree to take, or ha a right to charge.
The secon plea of Newton is ba, because in the face of the covenant he coul not eny that the solicitors were entitle to any fee. If, by the allegation that they i not charge any fee, is meant that they forgave or relinquishe it, for aught that. appears, it woul he & nuclurn pactum, which woul not prevent them from recovering the amount from the plaintiff, their client. No efence of this kin woul bar the action, short of an averment of such acquittance or release from them as woul protect the plaintiff against their rightful eman upon him for a fee.
No goo reason is perceive why the matter set up in the replication to the first plea is not sufficient to estop the efenant from claiming to avoi his covenant for the want of a literal an punctual compliance by Fowler with the stipulations of the compromise. The amissions of recor by the parties to the chancery suit, an upon which the ecree was preicate, secure to them the benefit of the release from the ebts an liabilities of Fowler, which his elay' in complying with the terms of compromise ha forfeite. Having accepte the benefit to which the ecree restore them, as if there ha been a compliance to the ay, they ought not to be hear to eny the fact of such compliance. In the strictest sense the estoppel was mutual, becaifse', against the ecree, More never coul aver that there ha been no compliance so as to set asie the agreement of compromise an charge the securities with the payment of the ebts.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This is an action upon a collector’s bon, brought against the sheriff an ex-officio assessor an collector of taxes of Pope county, an his securities. After setting out the bon an conition the breach assigne is, “that the sai John W. Jones i not well an truly collect an pay over the sai sum of thirteen hunre an seventeen ollars an seventy-seven cents so orere to be levie for the purposes of revenue of the sai county of Pope,” whereby the sai writing became an is forfeite, &c.
The enorsement on the writ woul show a regular service on the efenants, but it oes not appear to be signe by the sheriff. For this apparent iminution a writ of certiorari woul be aware ex-officio, if necessary in orer to affirm. The entry of the jugment is quite inartificial, leaving it oubtful whether the efenants appeare, so far as-to waive the necessity of a jury to enquire into the truth'of the breaches, an assess the amages, an consent that they shoul be assesse by the court sitting as a jury, though that seems to be the purport of the entry. An so, presuming everything possible in favor of the court below, it might be gathere from the whole entry, that the court below ascertaining the efalcation of the collector to be $113 08, an the penalty accrue upon it, tobe $226, intene to give jugment for the penalty of the bon, an that execution be aware for the amount of the amages assesse, together with the accruing forfeiture of five per cent, per month upon the amount of the original efalcation from the renition of the j ugment until the same shoul be pai an satisfie with costs, &c.
But waiving the consieration of those matters assigne for error, the jugment will have to be reverse upon the thir assignment which questions the sufficiency of the eclaration. Upon the principle ajuge by this court in the case of Outlaw vs. The Governor, 5 Ark., 468, relating to the moe of ascertaining an fixing the liability of the principal an securities upon an aministration bon, it was necessary for the eclaration in this case to contain an averment, either that the collector ha settle with the county court an faile to pay over the amount ue, Dig. Title, Revenue or Counties, secs. 6 an 7, or that he faile to settle, an that the county court proceee to ajust his accounts, an finally proceee to rener jugment against him, for the amount ue, with the penalty ae thereto, an fifty per centum per annum thereon, ib. sec. 34, et seq. Carnall vs. Crawfor county, 6 Eng. 624. Trice vs. Crittenen co., 2 Eng. 159.
The county court is the forum where the liability of the collector, upon which that of his securities epens, is to be ascertaine an evience by its recors. An ajuication in that forum is conclusive evience against the securities, as well as the collector, in an action upon his bon in the Circuit Court. There can be no liability upon the collector’s bon without such ajucation unless the Circuit Court can, in an action upon the bon raw to itself, in a collateral way, a jurisiction to investigate an settle the accounts of elinquent officers for the collection of revenue, which appropriately belongs to the county courts.
The jugment will be reverse, an the cause remane to the court below, with leave to be further proceee in, if the plaintiff' shall file an amene eclaration within such time as may be allowe by rule of that court, the efenants being consiere as having ue notice of the penency of the suit.",legal_case

By an act for the relief of the securities of John Hickey, sheriff of Pope county, approve January 11th, 1851, they were allowe until the first ay of November, thereafter, to pay the amount pf his efalcation as collector of the State an county revenue, for the year 1850, an release from all forfeitures an penalties incurre, provie, they woul give bon with security, to be approve by the county juge, in vacation, for the payment of the same an with interest upon the revenue ue the State. Availing themselves of this act, they execute the bon upon which this suit was brought. The bon is mae payable to the State for the penal sum of $3,933. An, after reciting that the principals ha become security for Ilickey, as collector, that he ha mae efault, &c., that there remaine ue an unpai, from him, on account of State revenue the sum of $1042 75, an for county revenue,the sum of $'925 73, an the act passe for their relief, it was conitione to be voi, if the principals shoul well an truly pay into the State treasury, an into .the county treasury, respectively, the sums above specifie, with interest, on or before the first ay of November thereafter.
No oubt exists as to the liability of these parties, an no useful en woul be attaine by a statement of the efence sought to be interpose by one of them. The only question arising upon the recor which requires to be notice is one of pi’actice. Demurrer being sustaine to the plea interpose by one of the efenants, an he saying nothing further, an the others making efault, the cpurt assesse the amages an gave jugment for the.pbt really ue, an interest, as in other cases, where the eman is ascertaine by the instrument upon which the suit is foune. Digest, title, Practice at Law, sec. 81.
It is argue for the plaintiff in error, that this proceeing is erroneous, an we are cite to the cases of Phillips vs. The Governor, 2 Ark. 382. Aams vs. The State, 1 Eng. 490. Outlaw vs. The Governor, 3 ib. 353. Nelson vs. Hubbar, ib. 477. an McLain vs. Taylor, 4 ib. 363. In all these cases the bons sue upon were conitione for the performance of some act other than the payment of money, being either upon elivery bons or official l)ons; an tho.ugh we think, that in some of those cases the court, have ahere to the language of the statute, perhaps with unnecessary strictness, for reasons which might be given, yet we are not require now to go into an examination of them.
The statute, Digest, title, Penal Bons, provies for three istinct classes of cases, an the moe of proceeing in each is ifferently regulate. The first four sections relate to actions foune on bons conitione for the payment of a less sum of money. The sections from five to fifteen, apply to suits on bons for the breach of any conition other than for the payment of money. Sections fifteen et seq. regulate the moe of proceeing in suits on official bons ; incluing those of aministrators, guarians, &c. It is only in the last two classes of cases, where the jugment is by efault, or on emurrer, that a jury must be calle, unless waive, to enquire into the truth of the breaches assigne, an assess the amages, an when, as ecie by the cases referre to, such shoul be the form of the oath aministere to the jury, in compliance with the statute. But upon the reaing of the statute those provisions have no application to actions on bons, conitione for the payment of a less sum, an where the amount ue is ascertaine, or ascertainable by computation from the face of the instrument itself, as is the case here. In all such cases the penalty is inserte rather as an aherence to ancient form, an not because it is an essential part of the contract; an while no goo reason can be imagine for the intervention of a jury to assess the amages, the statute is not so unreasonable as to require it.

In this case the efenant pleae the statute of limitation, to which the plaintiff file five replications : each amitting that more than three years ha elapse between the time her cause of action accrue, an the commencement of the suit; an relying upon the provisions of the 24th sect. Dig. ch. 99, which provies that where an action is commence before the cause of action is barre by limitation, an a non-suit is suffere, that such plaintiff may commence a new action within twelve months after such non-suit suffere, &c.
The first an secon of these replications no where aver against whom the first, or the several succeeing suits, after non-suit, were commence; an although the thir replication properly escribes the cause of action an the parties in the first suit, an that a non-suit was suffere, it wholly fails to show against whom the secon suit was commence. The fourth replication was withrawn ; the fifth replication avers that after the first non-suit, the plaintiff commence her action anew, “ with intent to implea the plaintiff, J. W. Wilson an Thaeus C. Wilson.” Conceing this to be a clerical misprision, an that the pleaer intene to say “efenant,” instea of “ plaintiff,” an the averment was in fact, that she intene to implea the efenant, J. W. Wilson an Thaeus C. Wilson, or the efenant, an the others, still the averment is insufficient. It is not enough to say that the plaintiff intene to sue, but there must be a irect averment that she i sue, &c. Each of these objections is fatal uner the ecision of this court in the case of The Bank vs. Sherrill, 7 Eng. 186.
The replications were therefore efective, an the emurrer to them properly sustaine.

Sproul brought ebt against McLaughlin, in the Clark Circuit Court, upon a bon for five hunre ollars, reciting that the latter ha sol the former a certain tract of lan escribe, an conitione to be voi if the obligor shoul make to the obligee, or cause it to be mae, a vali title, in fee simple to the lan in question, whenever the same shoul be subject to entry in the proper lan office — breach, that long after the lan was subject to entry, accoring to the intent an meaning of the bon, to wit, on &c., the plaintiff specially requeste an require the efenant to execute an eliver to him a goo an vali ee of conveyance for the same, which the efenant wholly neglecte an refuse. A emurrer to the eclaration was overrule, an the efenant saying nothing further, an electing to stan on his emurrer, the court renere jugment against him for the amount of the bon an costs, an aware execution therefor., but no amages were assesse.

An uner the receive rule in this country, that the recitals in a ee are prima facie evience of the payment of the purchase money, the same presumption of like payment arises from the face of this bon with collateral conition. An as there was no mutual or concurrent covenant, making it the uty of the plaintiff to o any other thing, besies making a reasonable eman for the conveyance, as a pre-requisite for his action, we think the emurrer was properly overrule.

On the secon ay of June,-1847, the plaintiff file in the office of a justice of the peace, the following instrument:-
“White county, March 3, 1842.
Twelve months after ate, we promise jointly an severally to pay to Abner Bailey, aministrator of Elijah Bailey, ecease, or orer, forty-five ollars an twelve an a half cents, for value receive, with interest at ten per cent, per annum, after maturity. Witness our hans an seals.
JOHN L. GATTON, [l.s.] ‘
JOHN M. CLARK, [l.s.]
AUGUSTUS GATTON, [l.s.]”
Upon which instrument so file the justice issue a summons requiring the efenants to appear before him to answer the complaint of Abner Bailey, aministrator of the estate of Elijah Bailey, ecease, on a note of han.
The case was brought by appeal from the justice’s court, to the Circuit Court, an upon the trial e novo, the efenant, Gatton, pleae, ne ungues aministrator, to which issue was taken, an the case was submitte to a jury for trial; when upon motion of the efenant, the writing obligatory was exclue as evience from the jury, because of an allege variance between the instrument offere, an that escribe in the summons, an to which the efenant was calle upon to efen. The court sustaine the motion to exclue the writing obligatory from the jury as evience, an thereupon a jugment was renere for the efenant, from which the plaintiff has appeale to this court.
The plea of ne ungues aministrator tenere an immaterial issue, because the writing obligatory was execute to the plaintiff, an the suit brought upon it was in his own name iniviually, an not as aministrator. The wors “aministrator, &c.,” were wors of personal escription, an the plaintiff might well elect to treat them as such, or .he might, at his election, have consiere the writing obligatory as assets, an have sue upon it as aministrator, as hel in Hemphill vs. Hamilton, 6 Eng. 428.
As regars the allege variance that the instrument escribe in the summons an which the efenant was calle to answer, was a note of han, an that offere in evience was a writing obligatory, it may be well to review our former ecisions; some of which woul seem to sustain the objection taken.
In the case of Jeffry vs. Unerwoo, 1 Ark. Rep. 108, the same state of facts presente here, came up for consieration. The efenant was summone to answer the complaint of the plaintiff upon a note of han, an the instrument offere in evience was a seale instrument. The court hel the variance fatal. It may be well to inquire whether, amitting this ecision to be correct, (an we will not question its correctness uner the statute then in force,) the change in our statute, since that ecision oes not materially affect the ecision.
Prior to the passage of our present statute, which took effect 20th March, 1839, it was not necessary to file the cause of complaint upon which the suit was brought, until the commencement of the trial! The efenant ha no other information in regar to the nature of the eman which he was summone to answer, than that isclose in the summons! The form of the summons is given, an uner it the instrument is to be set out. See sec. 41 Steel & McCamp. Dig. p. 365.
In this respect, our statute, as it existe when the present suit was commence, an as it now exists, is materially ifferent. Section 25 Dig., ch. 95 provies that “ wherever any suit shall be foune on any instrument of writing, pui-porting to have been execute by the efenant, such instrument shall be file with the justice, before any process shall be issue in the suit.” An in sec. 32, which gives the form of a summons, the escription of the eman, upon which the recovery is sought, is omitte. The Legislature, in making this change eviently intene, by require ing the instrument, upon which the suit was to be brought, to be file before the summons issue, to make it accessible to the efenant, an to furnish him with the necessary information, to enable him to efen against it.
The efenant no longer looks uner our present statute, to the summons for such information; an shoul it be unnecessarily inserte, it may be consiere as surplusage. The instrument file is the true evience of the nature of the complaint. It is in effect a eclaration, upon which the action rests, an is also, in some instances, the evience of the eman. We have no later ecisions that come fully up to the precise question now uner consieration. So far as they go, however, they may be sai to sustain the views which we have expresse. In Levy vs. Sherman, 1 Eng. 184, suit was brought on a bank note of the Bank of Missouri. The main question was, whether any cause of action was file; that is, whether a bank note, not enorse, was evience of inebteness from the plaintiff to the efenant. The coui't, in consiering that question, remarke upon this statute, to the effect that a escription of the instrument sue on, was unnecessary in the summons, as says the court, “it coul at all times be examine an inspecte by the parties. The plaintiff is require to put his cause of action on file, in orer that the averse party may know what he is calle upon to answer.”
In Patterson vs. Wilson, 1 Eng. 476, the summons was silent as to the cause of complaint. The justice escribe the instrument sue upon as a note, when, in fact, that file was a bon. The court hel, (an no oubt, correctly,) that the writing obligatory was competent evience.
In Anthony Ex parte, 5 Ark. 359, the suit was commence upon a change ticket, which, however, was not file. It is true that the summons require'the efenant to appear an answer in an action of account. But that was not the important enquiry. It was that no cause of action was file, an that if file it was such as the court coul not procee to try, as hel in Reeves vs. Clark.
We have taken occasion to make this brief review of the former ecisions of the court to show that the case of Jeffry vs. Unerwoo, is not authority uner, our present statute, an that our other ecisions favor the conclusions which we have announce; that, as the statute requires the instrument on which the suit is foune, to be file before the summons issues an ispenses with any escription of it in the summons, that the party efenant .shoul look to the instrument on file, an not to the summons for the cause of action against him. An consequently that a variance between the instrument on file, an that escribe in the summons will not avail the efenant on the trial. This construction is, in our opinion, in conformity with the spirit an intention of the statute, an will ten to remove a mere technical objection to a proceeing in a court where the most liberal construction shoul be inulge in favor of the regularity of its proceeings. The Circuit Court therefore erre in excluing the writing obligatory as evience from the jury.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The eclaration in this case was emurre to solely upon the groun that it was not entitle as in any court; an the Circuit Court sustaine the emurrer. This is the only question of error presente.
It is true, that in the commencement of the eclaration, neither the court nor the term of the court at which the writ is to be mae returnable, is set forth. The eclaration gives the venue,. “The State of Arkansas an county of Clark,” an then procees to the statement of the cause of action.' It cannot be a matter of importance with us to look into the reasons for entitling the eclaration as of a particular term, or ay of the term, as but few of them are applicable to our practice. Here the plaintiff is require by statute, to file his eclaration or statement in writing in the-clerk’s office of the county, in which he institutes his suit; an the-clerk of the Circuit Court thereupon issues his writ, returnable-to the first ay of the next succeeing term of the court, unless such eclaration be file within fifteen ays of the first term, an¡ then it is returnable to the secon term of the sai court; so that there is at best, but little necessity for a formal entitling of the eclaration. The objection is extremely technical, an at most coul only, be cause of special emurrer, which is isallowe by statute.
The Circuit Court therefore erre in sustaining the emurre to the plaintiff’s eclaration; an for this error the jugment must be reverse an the cause remane for further proceeings to be ha therein accoring to law..",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of ebt upon a note execute by Sumpter^ mae payable to James R. Kinkea, an by him assigne, by his within enorsement thereon, to the plaintiff. As the only questions of law arising upon the recor, relate to the fourth, fifth an sixth pleas of the efenant, we will irect our examination irectly to them.
The fourth plea enie the assignment of the note by Kinkea to the plaintiff, an was properly stricken out upon motion, because not verifie by affiavit. Sanger vs. Sumner, 13 Ark. Rep. 284.
The fifth an 6th pleas are substantially the same. They amitte the assignment to the plaintiff, but set up a payment of the sum, for which the note was assigne to the plaintiff by Kinkea; an a re-elivery of the note by plaintiff to him, in whose possession it remaine until his eath. Upon motion, the efenant was rule to elect, which of these pleas he woul rely upon, an to abanon the other; an having electe to rely upon the 5th plea, the plaintiff emurre to it, because the facts set forth in the plea show that the legal right of action is in the plaintiff.
The counsel for Sumpter contens that the re-elivery of the note by the plaintiff to Kinkea, i, by operation of law re-invest him with the legal title to it. This position is wholly irreconcilable with our ecision in the case of Block vs. Walker 2 Ark. Rep. 4, where it is hel, that when a note or bon is regularly assigne an elivere to the assignee, the legal title can only pass from him to another by a re-assignment of such note or bon. Nor oes this ecision, in the slightest egree, conflict with our later ecisions. In the case of Martin vs. Warren, 6 Eng. 285, the assignment was mae by a blank enorsement an elivery of the bill, which bill, with the enorsement still in blank, came again to the hans of the assignor. It was hel that being thus returne in blank, it veste in the holer a right to fill up the blank, an perfect the assignment in himself, or to pass it to another: an this rule was recognize an re-affirme in Sanger vs. Sumner.
The counsel seems to have urge the applicability of the rule in Martin vs. Warren, to the case uner consieration, uner a misapprehension of the facts set up in the plea. It is not averre as he seems to suppose, that the assignment was in blank. An taking the construction against the pleaer, we must infer that it was otherwise, or he woul hav'e so state it. The facts of the case bring it irectly within the rule lai own in Block vs. Walker: an the rule there hel is ecisive of this point. Therefore the Circuit Court i not err in sustaining the emurrer to sai plea.
As regars the allege error of the court below, in compelling the pleaer to elect, which of two pleas setting up the same efence, he woul rely upon, there can be no oubt, from the nature of the two pleas, that the court ecie correctly. Precisely the same grouns are relie upon, but slightly ifferent in the statement of them. If the ifference of the statement of facts woul make one a vali efence, an the other not, it is .the fault of the party, shoul he elect to rely upon that which is insufficient, an he has no cause for complaint,, that he selecte the wrong plea.
There is no other point which we eem- it important to notice.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
Wright sue Pryor, in ebt, in the Hempstea Circuit Court, on two promissory notes, payable'at the office of Wright, Williams, & Co., New Orleans. Besies the pleas of nil ebet an payment, on which issues were joine, Pryor interpose a further plea, that the notes in the eclaration mentione, were mae payable at the office of Wright, Williams 4"" Co., New Orleans, State of Louisiana, one of the Unite States of America, an that, by the laws of that State, at the ates of the notes an then still in force, all notes mae payable at a particular place within that State, are require to be presente, an a eman of payment mae at such place, an in efault of presentment an eman, the maker is ischarge from payment, an averre that neither of the sai notes was so presente, an payment thereof emane, an so he was release, an forever ischarge from the payment of the notes in question.
Upon the motion of the plaintiff, below, this thir plea was stricken out, to which ruling of the court the efenant excepte, an in his bill of exceptions save the plea in question upon the recor. Afterwars the efenant withrew his two former pleas, an saying nothing further, jugment was renere for the plaintiff, an the efenant brought his case here on writ of error.
The question presente is as to the action of the court in granting the motion to strike out the thir plea.
If the matters of fact set up by that plea can be establishe as such by evience, the plaintiff below will be preclue from a recovery, because the law of Louisiana, thus allege as a matter of fact to exist, governs the question of the liability of the efenant below. It is not at all probable, however, that the efenant can establish the truth of his plea by evience, the Supreme Court of Louisiana, having, as we have learne, as a matter of fact e hors this recor, overturne the previous ecisions of that court by the case of Ripka vs. Pope, (5 Lou. Annual Rep. 61) an conforme to what has long been consiere the American octrine — entertaine now,perhaps, by every appellate court in the Union — that as to the acceptor of a bill, an maker of a promissory note payable at a Bank, or other specific place, no presentment or eman of payment nee be mae at the specifie place on the ay when the bill or note becomes ue, or after-wars, in orer to maintain a suit against the acceptor, or maker, an of course that there nee be no averment in the eclaration in any suit brought thereon, or any proof at the trial of any such eman, or presentment. Such omission being matter of efence to the extent only, in general, that if the maker, or acceptor ha funs at the appointe time an place, to pay the note, or bill, he shall be exonerate, not inee, from the payment of the principal sum, but from cost an amages in such suit. In special cases, however, as if the bill or note was payable at a Bank, an the acceptor, or maker, ha funs there at the time, which are afterwars lost by the failure of the Bank, then the acceptor, or maker, woul be further exonerate, on showing such loss in his efence, to the extent of the loss thus sustaine (Story on Prom. Notes, sec. 228.
Nevertheless the court below ha no more authority to strike out the efenant’s plea in question, than it woul have ha to strike out his other plea of payment, foune upon some personal knowlege of the presiing juge, that no payment at all ha ever been mae, an therefore, that he coul not prove that plea. A efenant has a right to plea any matter of fact which may be an answer to the plaintiff’s eman; an the laws of the sister States are, beyon their limits, to be pleae an prove as matters of fact. Whether he can prove the matter allege in his plea, the plaintiff can ascertain by taking issue upon it. If he cannot, of course his efence fails, an the plaintiff obtains jugment.
For the error of the court below in granting the motion to strike out the plea in question, the jugment must be reverse, an the cause remane to be proceee with.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
Higgs, as aministrator, sue Warner, in assumpsit, for services renere by his intestate in his lifetime, as an attorney at law, an as an orinary agent, exhibiting a bill of particulars. Warner, besies the pleas of non-assumpsit an set-off, relie upon the plea of the statute of limitations. The replication to the latter plea, although taken in short on the recor by consent, we shall consier as a special one ; otherwise, the plaintiff’s case woul be at an en at once for want of appropriate allegations of the special facts, which he complains the court below refuse to allow him to prove by the evience he offere. The evience thus offere, an which the court refuse to permit the plaintiff to prouce to the jury, was, that of “ an account” file in the Probate Court, upon which Warner obtaine an allowance against the estate of the intestate, “ for ebts” ue by Hightower, the intestate, at the time of his eath, which bore ate an were charge within three years, next before the commencement of this suit. The object avowe by the plaintiff in offering this evience, was to prove by it that a mutual open account current, existe between Plightower, in his lifetime, an the efenant, Warner, this action having been brought, as the plaintiff alleges, to recover any balance that might be foun ue upon the-proper ajustment of such account, so as to bring his case within the provision of the 17th section of the statute of limitation (Dig.p. 698.) We have chosen to say that he offere to prove this fact of such a “ mutual open account current,” by this evience alone, because it is certifie to us by the court below, that the bill of exceptions in the recor, contains all the evience that was offere an rea to the jury on the trial of the cause, an we have examine the bill of exceptions closely, an fin in it no other, either offere an refuse, or actually prouce to the jury, which in the least conuces to prove any such “ a mutual open account current.” Uner such circumstances, then, i the court ¡below err in refusing to permit the plaintiff to rea the allege account in evience ?
To etermine this question we must ascertain the meaning of the section of the limitation act, just cite, in its connection with the other provisions of the statute'. Its own wors are its best exponent, that when an action shall be “ brought to recover any balance ue upon a mutual open account current, the cause of action shall be eeme to have accrue from the time of the last item prove in such account.” It was not to exempt open accounts current from the operation of the statute, not even when Such accounts were mutual, but to fix the point of time from which the statute woul begin to run on any such latter. Accoring to very common custom in this State, store accounts for goos sol, are ue the first ay of January following the year in which they are mae. From that time the statute orinarily begins to run upon them, the customer being suppose to have purchase with reference to this common custom, an therefore agreé to the maturity of the account at that time. Otherwise the general rule might apply, which is, in general, applicable to traesmen an artificers, &c., that the statute woul run from the ay of each article elivere, or piece of work one, an the continuation of the supply, or of the work one, woul not interrupt it; an iffering essentially from a uty which requires a continuation of services to complete the one act, as the uty of an attorney to commence an manage a suit. So the time for the closing of a mutual account current, might be stipulate for between the parties, either expressly or by implication, an the statute woul run on the balance from that ay, unless absorbe in a new mutual open account, in which the balance might form the first item. But if there be no stipulation between the parties, the statute enacts that the cause ofiaction shall be eeme to accrue from the ate of the last item. It is not, however, every open account current between parties, although they may severally have cross open accounts against each'other, that is a mutual one within the meaning of the statute. Such former woul of course be matter of set-off on either sie, an by agreement coul be converte into one inivisible open mutual account current; but unless by such agreement, either express or implie, they woul remain two several open accounts current, an not one entire inivisible mutual account, for which the balance only coul be proceee for, as contemplate by the section of the statute in question.
In the one mutual account current, contemplate by the statute, matters of set-off become converte eo instanti, into payment, an the balance only is recoverable. It is one consoliate transaction linke together, however numerous the items, by an alternative or correlative subsisting ebt on the one sie inucing the creit on the other. Agreement either express or implie, is of the very essence of such a mutual account current; because it is the act of the parties, an not the act of the law. The law but recognizes their act an carries out their intention as manifeste by their act. It oes not of its own force, convert cross ealings into one inivisible mutual account, but encourages gai’ties to o so, as it oes to use their cross emans as’set-off rather than institute an inepenent cross action upon them.
When, however, the parties elect to pursue the course of ealing contemplate by the statute, it necessarily results that any one item on either sie of the one mutual account woul raw to it every other item with which it was connecte by this chain of ealing, because in the view of the statutory provision-, we are consiering lire whole is one entire transaction. It coul not, however, possibly raw to it any item with which it was not so connecte for want of the essential element of the mutual agreement of the pai'ties. Analogous to a payment mae by a party who faile to exercise his right of appropriation, when making a payment to a creitor who hols two separate emans, one barre by the statute an the other not; an the creitor, in the exercise of his orinary right of appropriation, applies it in part liquiation of the stale eman, such woul not be a part payment within the statute, so as to revive the remey for want of the essential elements of appropriation by the ebtor.
Whether or not, then, in a case like this at bar, there was such a course of mutual ealings between the parties as is contemplate by the statute, is a material fact. An as such a course of ealings is foune upon the agreement of the parties, express or implie, an oes not necessarily follow', as the consequence of the fact, that each party may have an open account current against the other, there is no groun from which to presume such course of ealing, even prima facie from proof of the existence of a cross open account current, as there woul be to presume appropriation of a partial payment, mae generally to a creitor, who hel a subsisting eman ; because, in the latter case, in the absence of all repelling circumstances, the payment coul be referre to nothing else than to this subsisting eman, whereas, in the former case the creit given, which woul constitute the cross eman, might well enough, until the contrary shoul appear by facts or circumstances, be regare as a creit at large. In the usual course of ealings, men rarely pay money unless they owe it, whilst it is one of the most orinary circumstances in common life for a man to creit one he oes not owe.
If, therefore, the court ha permitte the evience in question to have gone to the jury,’unconnecte as it was with the proof of any other fact or circumstance, in any egree conucing to prove the existence of a mutual open account current, within the meaning of the statute, between the plaintiff’s intestate an the efenant, a verict foune upon it in favor of the plaintiff woul have been so utterly without evience to sustain it, that it coul not have been permitte to stan. So that even if we might think the evience in question competent as tening one step towars the establishment of the main fact, the burthen of which was upon the plaintiff to pr-ove, its exclusion uner the state of this case, as it appears upon the recor, in no way worke the prejuice of the plaintiff..
We .think, also, that there was no error in the court below to permit the reaing in evience, to prove the set-off, the “proceeings, recovery an recor,” as it appears by the bill of exceptions was allowe : an the jugment recovere in that court against the plaintiff, as aministrator, was, we think, a goo matter of set-off uner our statute. (Dig. ch. 150, sec. 2, 3.
We fin no error in the ruling of the court, either as to the instruction given, or those refuse. The ‘ruling as to these was substantially correct.
It was suggeste by the counsel for the appellee, that there was no question upon this recor for the consieration of this court, because, although the plaintiff below excepte to the ecision of the court overruling his motion for a new trial, he faile to have a bill of exceptions seale.
In the case of Berry vs. Singer, (5 Eng. R. at p. 490) we remarke that “ we woul not go the length that is apparently inicate in Sawyer vs. Lathrop (4 Eng. R. 67), of requiring that the evience shoul, in every case, be brought upon the recor, only after the overruling of a, motion for a new trial. On the contrary, we think that if it may have been brought regularly upon the recor before, an the recor shows istinctly that all the evience was so regularly of recor; as might well be one in exceptions that might be taken by bill to the giving or refusing to give instructions to the jury in orer to show the application or misapplication of the law to the facts, there woul be no more necessity in such case of reproucing such evience in the last bill of exceptions to the overruling of the motion for a new trial than there woul be to reconstruct any other part of the re-» cor. Because the waiver which is the result of a motion for a new trial, is no mutilation of the recor, proucing thereby any necessity for its reprouction in the last bill of exceptions, but simply a waiver of the right to insist upon exceptions taken uring the trial, as mere errors in law,” unless preserve by exceptions taken to the overruling of the motion for a new trial.
In the case at bar, all the evience prouce on the trial, an that which the court woul not allow to be prouce to the jury, as well as all the instructions given an refuse, are upon the recor regularly, an so is the motion for a new trial, an the exception of the appellant to the ecision of the court overruling his motion for a new trial. A bill of exceptions coul have therefore brought nothing more upon the recor than was alreay there; an that istinguishes this case from that of For vs. Clark, (7 Eng. R. 99), an several other cases.

The efenant interpose several pleas, upon which issues were joine, an also that the plaintiff’s cause of action ha not accrue within three years next before the commencement of the suit. To this plea the plaintiff replie first, to the effect that his intestate ha institute suit on the note in question, in the Johnson Circuit Court, on the 14th of February, 1840, against the efenant an his co-promissor, John Howell, pening which suit plaintiff eparte this life, an at the December term of sai court, in the year 1840, his eath was suggeste, an that such further proceeings were ha afterwars in that suit; that at the September term of sai court, in the year 1845, it was orere to be revive, an progress in the name of the plaintiff as aministrator, at which term the efenant an sai John pleae to the action, an on the 2 ay of September 1846, in that court, the plaintiff recovere jugment in that suit, for the amount of sai pote with amages an costs of suit. That sai jugment was remove by writ of error to the Supreme Court, where it was ajuge an ecie that the jugment of the Johnson Circuit Court was null an voi, an that the writ of error be ismisse: whereby the jugment an, proceeings ha in the Johnson Circuit Court became, an were arreste; an that the plaintiff, on the 8th of December, 1849, an within one year after such ajuication an ecision of the Supreme Court, commence the present suit against the efenant. The secon replication is to the effect that the efenant an his co-promissor, John Howell, were partners in trae, an mae the note in question on account of their partnership concerns, an that John Howell, on the first ay of March, 1847, an within five years next before the commencement of this suit, mae a certain payment to the plaintiff upon the note in question.
The facts intene to be set up in the replication are state so as to give the plaintiff in error the full benefit of them without regar to any efect of form. Upon emurrer sustaine to the replications, final jugment went against the plaintiff in error.-
The questions of law presente upon this recor may be briefly ispose of. The first replication is no avoiance of the bar setup in the plea, because regaring the ecision of this court, whatever it was, to be the law of the case, there was no jugment of the Johnson Circuit Court to be arreste or reverse on error; an the plaintiff fails to bring himself within the savings of the 24th section of the statute of limitations. The secon replication ie ba, because, accoring to the repeate ecisions of this court, the act of December 14th, 1844, being prospective, oes not apply to causes of action accruing prior to its passage, which are-governe by the then existing laws, as to the limitation of actions, which was three years upon promissory notes, so that the part payment allege to have been mae in 1847, i not have the legal effect of exteningthe right of action for five years from that perio. But uner the ecision in Biscoe vs. Jenkins, (5 Eng. R. 108,) another objection is fatal to this replication. The first payment by John Howell having been after the note in suit-was barre, woul have the effect to revive the ebt as against him, but woul not revive it against his co-promissor.
The jugment of the court below must be affirme with costs.

This case was before this court at a previous term, (5 Eng. 309,) an was reverse. The evience on the secon trial, if not ientically, is at least substantially the same as reporte. It has become the settle law of this court, that a refusal to grant a new trial, on the general groun that the verict is contrary to law an evience, will not be reviewe, unless there is a total lack of evience upon one or more points necessary to the maintainance of the action, or making out the efence. Where the question simply is as to the weight or sufficiency of the evience, this court will not isturb either the fining of the court sitting as a jury, or the verict of the jury.

We woul not invae their constitutional authority, but at the samé time we woul not have it unerstoo that they are final arbiters of life, liberty an property.
In the case now before the court, the verict is without evience to sustain it, an falls within the rule above lai own, an the jugment must be reverse.

This was an action of ebt brought by the plaintiffs against the efenants, on a recognizance conitione in substance, that the Real Estate Bank shoul prosecute with effect, a writ of error which she ha sue out in the case of herself against the present plaintiffs, an on which she ha obtaine a superseeas, an pay the money that might be ajuge against her by the Supreme Court, or otherwise abie the ecision of that court therein.
It appears that the jugment in that case was reverse on the 22 August, 1842, an the case orere to be remane for further proceeings. On the 27th August the efenants in error in that suit, file a motion for reconsieration, an obtaine leave to submit a written argument, on or before the first ay of the next term, to which term the case was continue. The opinion of the court was not recalle, nor the jugment set asie, nor suspene. On the 10th January, 1843, at the succeeing term, the petition for reconsieration was file, an taken uner avisement, an on the 7th July, 1843, at the following term, the cause was orere to stan for rehearing, the jugment to be set asie, an it was then taken uner avisement. On the 7th August, 1844, the orer of 7th July, 1843, was annulle, the petition for reconsieration refuse, an the jugment of 1842, orere to stan as the jugment of the court. On the 9th August, 1844, this last orer was set asie, an the cause was again submitte to the court an was argue by counsel, an on consieration, whereof the jugment of the Circuit Court was reverse an orere to relate back to an take effect as of the first ay of the term.
This seems to be the present attitue of the suit, an certainly no examples coul more forcibly emonstrate the evils which must result from attempts to isturb the jugments an ecrees of courts of recor, after the term at which they were pronounce, has passe. It seems at one time to have been regare as a question of practice in this court resting upon the soun iscretion of the juges. But ifficulties of such a formiable character sprung out of the practice, as to inuce the juges to pause an investigate the question of power, an it was then announce, as a true principle, that uner our system of jurispruence, courts of recor o not possess the power an authority to vacate, annul, reverse, or suspen their jugments an ecrees after the term has passe. Ashley vs. Hye & Goorich, 1 Eng. 100. An it was sai in that case, that “upon principle an preceent when the Supreme Court once ajuicates a question, pronounces its opinion, reners jugment thereon, an the term el apses, leaving the jugment in full force, the case passes forever beyon the jurisiction of the court; except it again be brought up by appeal or otherwise, after another trial in the inferior tribunal.”
After a careful examination, we entirely approve of the octrine in that case, an hol it to be the settle law of this court. So far inee from being issatisfie with it, we cannot conceive on what possible grouns a ifferent octrine coul be maintaine, without converting courts of recor into courts of original an appellate jurisiction, an allowing them to pronounce jugments at one term an reverse them at another, an thereby exercise a power, neither inherent in or elegate to them. As to this question, this court is not ifferent from other courts. Inee, as there is no tribunal to revise our acts, it is our imperative uty, in all cases, to avoi the exercise of all oubtful powers.
It cannot be enie that there is a right inherent in the nature an organization of every court of recor, to amen jugments an process at any time, in orer to attain the ens of justice an perfect the proceeings accoring to the truth, as it existe at the time. An this right has its origin in the general power of the court to o justice, rather than in any statute of jeofails. Mara vs. Quinn, 6 Term Rep. 8. Dillon vs. The Mayor of Grampon, 7 Term Rep. 699. King vs. The State Bank. 4 Eng. 188.
But this is quite a ifferent question from setting asie or vacating a jugment after the term has passe. The one is intene to perfect the proceeings an maintain the jurisiction of the court, the other to estroy — the one is to uphol, the other to overturn.
The jugment of reversal renere in the case of The Real Estate Bank vs. Rawon, Wright & Hatch, (5 Ark. 559,) at the July term 1842, was not set asie nor recalle at that term. The leave to file a motion for reconsieration, an a written argument at the next term, an the continuauce of the cause coul notin our opinion have that effect. Nor was the jugment ever regare by this court as having been set asie or suspene, because, on the. 7th July, 1843, a reconsieration was grante, an the jugment for the first time orere to be set asie; an although this orer was irregular, yet it serves to show that, up to that time the jugment was consiere as in full force.
In Ashley vs. Hye & Goorich, 1 Eng. 92, it was hel that the filing of a motion for leave to present a petition for rehearing' or granting that leave by the court, or actually filing such petition coul not have the effect of suspening the jugment of the court. This we regar as a ecisive authority on the present question: because, although a continuance was orere in the case of The Real Estate Bank vs. Rawon, Wright Hatch, an none in the case just quote, yet it will reaily occur to any one that that is an immaterial circumstance, an cannot affect the principle ecie. The two cases are similar, an ientical in substance, because, to grant leave to file a petition for rehearing at a future term, woul seem to be equivalent to a continuance of the cause to that term, for otherwise the leave coul not be mae available. That the court might have intene to set asie or suspen the jugment renere in 1842, may be amitte,but that it was one either irectly or inirectly, or that any act equivalent to it was performe at that term, is a proposition which cannot in our opinion be maintaine.
We are compelle by preceent an principle to eclare that the jugment of the Supreme Court in the case of The Real Estate Bank against Rawon, Wright & Hatch, renere the 22 August, 1842, was a vali an bining jugment, not reverse, vacate nor suspene, an that all the action, an orers, an proceeings of the Supreme Court with regar thereto subsequent to the term at which the jugment was pronounce, were nullities, possessing no juicial sanction, the jurisiction over the subject matter being exhauste at that term, as was hel by this court in the late case of Cossitt vs. Biscoe, 7 Eng. 95.
It may not be amiss to remark that we cannot' perceive any groun for a reconsieration, an if the jugment of the Circuit Court was now irectly before us for revision, we shoul have no hesitation in reversing it, as i the ol court, because it is clear enough from all the facts that the present,plaintiffs in error gave creit to, an looke to Williamson the agent for payment, oubtless preferring his responsibility to that of the Bank; an their remey was not against the Bank, but Williamson, iniviually. Real Estate Bank vs. Rawon et al., 5 Ark. 558.
It only remains for us to say that, as the jugment of 1842, was vali bining an unreverse,itfollows as a necessary consequence that the writ of error was prosecute with effect, an the conition of the recognizance performe. While the efenants in error as sureties are to be hel to their engagements, yet their liability is not to be extene by implication; an as it appears on the merits that they are not liable, the court correctly foun for them, an ischarge them by its jugment.
Other questions iscusse by counsel with great ability, we o not eem it necessary to investigate or ecie on the present occasion, contenting ourselves with affirming the jugment of the Circuit Court, as on the whole recor we consier it to be right.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of assumpsit, brought by Patrick against Holleville, an in which there was a trial by jury on the general issue, an a verict an jugment for Patrick, to review which this writ of error has been sue out by Holleville.
The eclaration contains two counts, similar to each other, but on two ifferent causes of action; an it may be remarke, that a eclaration coul harly be more inartificially rawn, an if we felt ispose to countenance technical objections, there woul be no ifficulty in fining them in it. The case stans in this court on the eclaration alone; because the bons an assignments therein escribe have not been mae a part of the recor by oyer, bill of exceptions or otherwise, an cannot be notice for any purpose whatever, although copie into the transcript.
The eclaration avers the writings obligatory to have been mae by William Strong an payable to Holleville on the 1st January, 1841; that they were before payment, assigne by him to Patrick, “to wit, on the 10th ay of July, 1841:” that when they became ue, they were presente fpr payment, an payment require “accoring to the tenor an effect thereof;” but that neither Strong nor Holleville pai the same; an it is then averre that “of all which sai premises the sai Holleville afterwars, to wit: on the 10th ay of July, 1841, ha notice.”
As a general rule, it is not to be enie, that a party is always boun by his own pleaings, an can make no proof in contravention of them. But it is equally as well establishe, as an exception, that it is not essential to state the real or precise time unless it constitutes a material part of the contract; nor in criminal proceeings, except where time forms an ingreient of the offence. An although a certain ay is state, yet neither in civil nor criminal cases, nee the ay be prove as lai, but an entirely ifferent ay may be prove, an it will be well enough. 1 Chitty's Pl. 288, 289. 1 Chitty's Cr. L. 224.
In assumpsit on a contract, whether express or implie, the plaintiff is at liberty to prove that it was mae at any other time than that allege. 2 Stra. 806. So, in an action against the acceptor of a bill payable after sight, an allegation that it was accepte on the ay of the ate will be prove, though it appear it was accepte on a subsequent ay. 1 Chitty's Pl. 288.
It was neither necessary nor usual to aver in the eclaration the precise time when the assignments were mae, or when payment was require, or notice of non-payment given. These were all matters of evience, which, for the sake of preserving brevity an perspicuity in pleaing, are never to be state. 1 Chitty's Pl. 258. Those ates were state uner a vielicet, an we are of opinion, might have been rejecte as surplusage, an which will not vitiate after verict. Chapman vs. Smith 13 John. 80. Hyslop vs. Jones, 3 McLean, 96. The case of Jackson vs. Henerson, 3 Leigh, 210, 217, is an express authority to the point, that if the eclaration avers that a bill was presente, an payment emane when the same became ue an payable, an then uner a scilicet, states a precise ay on which it was one, that ay is immaterial, nee not be prove, an may be rejecte as surplusage. To the same effect is the case of Bynner vs. Russell, 1 Bingham 23. S. C. 7 Moore 266, on the authority of which the case in Virginia was ecie.
It cannot amit of serious oubt, that it was competent for either party on the trial, to have prove that the assignments ha been mae, or that payment ha been emane, or notice of non-payment given at ifferent perios from those averre in the eclaration. Neitherparty was boun by those piecise ates, an might, as we have seen, have treate them as surplusage, an for aught we can know, such proof might have been actually-mae as above inicate.
This case was trie by a jury on the general issue. No exceptions were taken uring the trial, nor was any motion mae for a new trial, or in arrest of jugment. It stans on error, an consequently if the eclaration iscloses a cause of action the jugment must be affirme. The octrine on this subject is that when a eclaration or other pleaing sets forth a goo title or groun of action in a efective manner, the imperfection will be cure by verict, but a want of title is not aie. 1 Saun. 227, 2 Soun. 319, a, b. c. 10 Bac. Abr. Verict (X) 335.
An this court in Sevier vs. Holliay, 2 Ark. 571, approve an lai own the same principle, namely, that “where there is any efect, imperfection or omission in any pleaing, whether in substance or in form, which woul have been a fatal objection on emurrer, yet if the issue joine be such as necessarily requires on the trial, proof of the faots so efectively or imperfectly state, or omitte, an without which it is not to be presume that either the juge woul irect the jury to give, or the jury woul have given the verict, such efect, imperfection or omission is cure by the verict at common law.” Now no one can rea the eclaration without perceiving that it iscloses a right or cause of action, although partially obscure by the want of technical skill an precision in the pleaer. The imperfections in it are precisely of that character which a verict was intene, uner the rule above lai own, to cure. An it is the more essential that it shoul be so, because, inepenent of the general presumption of correctness which attaches to jugments of inferior courts until the contrary is mae to appear, we may well suppose that on the trial, such facts were prove as establishe the liability of the plaintiff in error, holing it clear that this might have been one uner the eclaration, an on the issue that was forme.
The case of Ruston vs. Aspinall, Dougl. 653, relie on by th© counsel for the plaintiff in error, is not applicable, because, the eclaration faile to allege a eman an refusal by the acceptor; but in this eclaration, eman, refusal an notice are allege. Consiering that the eclaration in this case iscloses a cause of action, an that the imperfections in it'are cure by the verict, an we affirm the jugment.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This suit is brought against Ruell alone, on the joint obligation of Moore an himself. The bon was barre by the statute of limitations, unless the bar was remove by part payment-The efenant pleae the statute of limitations, to which the plaintiff replie generally. Uner this issue, the plaintiff offere evience of such part payment, but the efenant objecte to the evience upon two grouns, first, that the evience offere was-incompetent an inamissible to prove part payment; an secon, that if amissible as evience in other respects, it u as inamissible uner the issue forme. The court overrule his objections an permitte the evience to be given uner the issue, to which the efenant excepte. The same question was again-presente upon a motion for a new trial; an upon exception to-the opinion of the court in refusing, to grant a new trial, the case* is brought here by appeal.
Uner the issue forme it evolve upon the plaintiff to prove-that the cause of action ha accrue within five years next before-the commencement of the suit, which ates from-the filing of the bon, which, uner the statute, is in effect a eclaration, an the issuing of the writ thereon, an the time- when the bon fell ue ; facts to be establishe by the terms of the contract, an the recor evience of the commencement of the suit. If the plaintiff shoul seek to avoi the force an effect of this evience,by show-in§,a new promise, or a new an ifferent point from which the-statute bar commence to run, it is an affirmative matter, the truth of which he must show, an he must also necessarily confess the time at which the bar, by the terms of the contract, commence running. It is then necessarily like matter in confession an avoiance, an shoul be so replie.
Chitty, in his work on pleaing, vol. 1, page 583, says that, when the plea is that the cause of action i not accrue within, &c., the plaintiff coul prove a promise or acknowlegment within.that time, an that the replication might, in such case, be general; but if the time of issuing the first writ in the action were material, it must have been replie specially : an as, that a special replication is, in general, avisable. An upon this istinction as to whether the plea oes, or oes not put the time of issuing the writ in issue, rest all the cases to which the plaintiff has referre, except the cases ecie in Massachusetts Reports, which, upon quite a ifferent state of case, give preference to the proceeing by special replication, an in case the time of issuing the writ is putin issue, make it inispensably necessary to plea specially. Greenleaf, in his work on Evience, vol. 2, sec. 440, page 416, says, “ that if the plaintiff woul avoi the bar by proof of an acknowlegment of the claim, he can only o it uner a special replication of a new promise within the time limite.” An so, also, the exceptions in favor of merchant an merchant, an other exceptions must be replie specially. I. sec. 447-448.
In the case of Trustees vs. Hartfiel, 5 Ark. Rep. 557, the precise question as to whether part payment coul or not be given in evience uner the general replication, was not iscusse; but the court in passing upon the sufficiency of the special replication, hel, that part payment might be given uner the general replication, or might be replie specially.
In Walker vs. Bank Mississippi, 2 Eng. Rep. 504, although the question was not irectly before the court, an for that reason cannot be hel as overruling in express terms the case of Trustees vs. Hartfiel, the court hel that an avoiance of the statute bár by limitation, uner any of the exceptions of the statute, shoul be specially replie. An in Ringgol & Hynson vs. Dunn, 3 Eng. 497, the same rule was hel, when more fully presente, an in still stronger terms. In McClellan vs. The Bank, 7 Eng. 141, where a general replication was file to a plea of the statute of limitation, the recor of a former suit brought on the same cause of action was offere in evience, to bring the case within the exception of the 24th section, Dig. chap. 99, which allows the plaintiff to renew his action within one year next after a jugment of non-suit, it was hel that in orer to let in evience of such former suit, the plaintiff shoul have file a special replication setting up such facts in avoiance of the statute bar.
An in the case of Woos vs. State Bank, 7 Eng. 697, an also in a case still more recently ecie, Bank vs. Conway, January term, 1853, it was hel the safer an more regular practice to require part payment, when relie upon to remove the statute bar, to be specially replie. So that it is not now an open question of practice, but one sactione an approve by this court, both upon soun principles of pleaing an authority: an being, in our opinion, best calculate to present the efinite matter in issue isencumbere from the other facts which might arise uner the general replication, an to limit the proof to it, we o not feel at liberty to epart from it.
Evience of part payment was, therefore, inamissible uner the issue as forme, an shoul have been exclue by the court, inepenent of all consieration of its sufficiency otherwise, which we will next procee to consier.
There were several creits upon the bon, all of which, except one, purporte to be payments mae by Moore, the obligor, not sue. The first payment appears to have been mae by Moore, an, if proven to have been mae at the time it bore ate, woul have remove the statute bar. To prove this the plaintifF offere in evience the following instrument, to-wit: “All of the above creits were mae by me, except the three ollars, an the ates of the creits are correct. Decir. 2, 1850. (signe) Wm. Moore.” An after proving the execution thereof, offere the same, together with the first enorsement of a payment (which purporte to have been mae by Moore) as evience, an the same, against the objections of the efenant, were amitte as evience to the jury.
In orer to prove part payment, as against a co-obligor, it must be shown that such payment was mae at a time when its legal effect woul be to remove the statute bar. Bank vs. Wooy, 5 Eng. 643. Woo vs. Wyls, 6 Eng. 759. The mere enorsement of a creit, as of a ate to effect this, isjnot of itself sufficient: but it must be shown that the enorsement of payment was in fact mae within such time. But where the enorsement is mae by the obligors, or one of them, then proof of that fact will be sufficient evience to permit the enorsement to be rea as evience, as well of the ate as the fact of payment.
After the statute bar has attache no act or amission of one •co-obligor will bin another. Trustees vs. Jenkins, et al. 5 Eng. 108. Such acts an amissions are alone bining upon the party making them. Moore’s amissions, therefore, at the time when they were mae, whether wiitten or verbal, were inamissible as evience against Ruell, an shoul have been exclue. He was not sue, an was clearly a competent witness to prove the fact of such payment, as well as the time when it was mae, whether mae by Ruell or himself.

elivere the opinion of the court.
This was a suit in chancery, to enjoin a jugment at law. The grouns for equitable relief are: that the complainant was security for one Whitfiel, upon a elivery bon. That after the bon was forfeite an before the renition of tlie jugment thereon, Arrington, the creitor, without the knowlege or consent of the complainant, mae a new contract with Whitfiel, the principal in the bon, by which he postpone the payment of the ebt to a further ay. An also, upon the further groun, that after the bon ha been returne forfeite, an before suit upon it, the creitor sue out an alias execution upon the original jugment against Whitfiel, the principal in the bon, an cause the same to be levie upon the personal property of Whitfiel, of value sufficient to pay the ebt, an that after such levy, by the orer of the creitor, the execution was returne without sale or isposition of the property.
It becomes unnecessary to ecie upon the merits of the equitable efence here set up, or whether it is sustaine by proof, until we ispose of a preliminary question, as to whether the efence, conceing it to be sufficient, shoul not have been mae upon the trial of the case at law.
It has been settle by the previous ecisions of this court, that this is a matter of efence over which the common law an the chancery courts have concurrent jurisiction. Hempstea & Conway vs. Watkins, a. 1 Eng. 317 It is a complete legal efence? an may be.pleae as such, Calwell vs. McVicar, 4 Eng. 418, an the efenant may elect to efen in a court of law, or shoul he ecline to efen there, he may set up such efence in chancery. Hempstea & Conway vs. Watkins. But shoul he elect to efen in a court of law, an fail in his efence, ho is hel to his election, an cannot again present his efence in a court of chancery, unless there is an express averment of frau, surprise, accient, or the like, which may in some instances entitle the party to relief in chancery, notwithstaning his efence at law. Garvin et al. vs. Squires, 4 Eng. 533. When the efenant submits himself *to the jurisiction of the court of law, by offering any efence whatever, it matters not whether by emurrer to the eclaration, plea in abatement, or in bar, it amounts to an election of jurisiction, an having mae such election, he must make efence there, an whatever efence is not mae, will be consiere as having been waive. Le Guen vs. Gouverneur, 1 John. Cases, 505.
In truth, from the moment he comes into the court of common law to efen, his election is fixe, an he stans in all respects, as if it was a efence over which the common law court ha exclusive jurisiction, an his excuse for a failui’e to make a full an successful efence must be the same as if no such concurrent jurisiction ha ever existe.
In this case the parties were all before the court. The efenant emurre to the plaintiff’s eclaration, upon which issue was joine, an a jugment renere. This is a efence, a submission to the jurisiction of the court, an an election to efen there. The nature of the efenceitself is not so important. The true enquiry is, has the court power to hear the efence, an has the efenant electe to be hear in that coui’t. If so, he must abie his election. Courts of chancei’y abhor multiplicity of act mis, an require vigilance at the hans of its favore suitors. Such vigilance was cleaxy not shown in this case, nor is any reason assigne for eclining to follow up his efence in a court that ha thus acquire jurisiction of the parties, an where an issue was tenere, upon which that court ha fall power to affor the same relief that is sought in this court. It must be remembere too, that before the case of Hempstea of Conway vs. Watkins, settle the practice ifferently, it was rather the favore opinion that when the plaintiff tenere to the efenant an issue in a court of law, upon which the efence was full an complete in that court, such efenant was boun to make such efence, or shoul he suffer a efault, he shoul not be hear thereafter in a court of chancery, even though such court ha concurrent jurisiction with the court of law to hear an etermine the same. An there is certainly not wanting both goo reason an authority for this ; for, amitting that the courts have concurrent jurisiction, an are in all respects equally competent to hear the efence, that which first gets jurisiction of the parties, an in which the issue is first tenere, woul seem to have preceent right to ajuicate an finally settle the matter litigate.
We are not to be unerstoo by these remarks as issenting from the correctness of the ecision in the case of Hempstea & Conway vs. Watkins, but simply as intening to show that the rule shoul not be extene further. In that case there was no efence whatever : in this, there was a efence, an election to appear an efen. An in the absence of any sufficient excuse for not having followe up that efence, the efenant will not be hear to complain in this court. Because from the time such election was mae, it cease to be a matter of concurrent jurisiction, an became a matter exclusively within the jurisiction of the common law court. The efenant was not eprive of his right to select in which court he woul make his efence, but i elect, an having one so must abie by it.
As therefore the court of chancery ha no jurisiction of this case it becomes unnecessary to enquire whether the facts sustain the equitable efence set up or not.
The ecree of the Jefferson Circuit Court must therefore be reverse with instructions to assess amages ujrnn the issolution of the injunction an to ismiss the bill.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The first groun of exception in this case is as to the correctness of the ecision of the Circuit Court in sustaining the plaintiffs emurrei'jto the efenants plea in abatement. The matter pleae in abatement was a varíen ce between the writ of summons an a copy of the summons serve upon the efenant. This was no groun for abating the action; at most it was an inirect attack upon the sheriff’s return. If the sheriff ha not, in fact, serve the efenant with a true copy of the writ, an ha falsely returne a vali service, it might become the subject of inquiry upon a irect proceeing against him for a false return, but was no groun whatever for abating the writ. Hughes vs. Martin, 1 Ark. Rep. 386. The plea shoul have been stricken out! There was no necessity for emurring to it, but the objection by emurrer was also goo. An issue-upon it, if tenere, woul, in fact, have settle nothing beyon a question of service.
The secon groun is that after a jugment by efault an upon inquiry of amages before the jury, the efenant was ene the privilege of cross-examining the witnesses introuce to establish the amount of amages sustaine.
In this we think there was error. By failing to appear an. efen, or after having appeare an pleae in abatement, the failure of the efenant to plea in bar, was a confession of the plaintiff’s right to recover amages, an although after such efault or failure to plea, the efenant coul not be hear to eny that some amages were recoverable, still, it was not an amission of any particular amount of amages. If so, there woul be no necessity for a writ of inquiry of amages; an although we have not foun any ajuicate case settling the practice in such cases, we can see no goo reason why the efenant shoul be eprive of his right to cross-examine the witnesses introuce by the plaintiff upon the trial of the inquiry of amages, in orer to show truly what amages ha been sustaine.
In this case we o not know what the question intene to be aske was, nor o we know the range of enquiry inulge upon the examination in chief. The opinion of the court woul seem to eny all cross-examination, irrespective of the nature or extent of the enquiry. Without, therefore, knowing what the particular state of case was, or intening to be unerstoo as eciing that any an all evience, which, uner proper issues forme, woul ten to lessen the amount of amages, may be offere by the efenant upon an inquiry of amages, uner the state of case pre sente we think the Circuit Court erre in refusing the efenant permission to cross-examine the plaintiff’s witnesses. An for this error the jugment of the Circuit Court must be reverse, an the cause remane.",legal_case

This is a proceeing by attachment against Ellis, a non-resient efenant. A eclaration in ebt for $1,450 32, a bon for costs, an affiavit for $671 86, an attachment bon for $1500, all in ue form, having been file, the clerk of tbe Circuit Court of Phillips county issue a writ, which is not questione otherwise than we shall presently state, commaning the sheriff “to attach George W. Ellis, by all an singular his goos an chattels, bons an tenements, creits an effects, or so much thereof as shall be sufficient to secure the sum of six hunre an seventy-one ollars an eighty-six cents, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, from the 23 ay of April, A. D. 1851, together with the costs of this suit. An you are also commane to summon the sai George W. Ellis, if he be foun in your county, to be an appear before the juge of our Circuit Court, at the court house, in an for sai county of Phillips, on the 4th Monay in May next, A.

Hill, merchants, an partners, traing an oing business uner their firm, name an style of Cossitt, Howar & Hill, the plaintiffs in this suit, in the premises, *as set forth an sworn to. An you are further commane, <^c.”
To this writ two pleas in abatement were file, praying that it might be quashe; first, because the sai writ wants these wors “ in an action of ebt for the sum of fourteen hunre an fifty ollars an thirty-two cents, ebt, an two hunre ollars amages secon, he says that the sai writ of attachment wants these wors “ as sworn to.” To the first plea the plaintiffs interpose a emurrer, an replie to the secon. An the issues in law an fact, severally, having been foun for the plaintiffs’ below, an the efenant taking exceptions an eclining to answer further, final jugment w7as renere against him an he appeale to this court.
Upon the authority of the cases of Renner vs. Ree, (3 Ark. R. 339) an of Chilress vs. Fowler, (4 Eng. R. 159) it is contene that the writ ought to have been quashe on the first objection.
Allowing that the remey by attachment, both in process an pleaing, in all matters beyon the scope of the statutory provision setting it on foot, is to be governe by the general provisions of law applicable to other law suits, an that these statutory provisions themselves are to be construe in reference to our entire system of laws; an recognizing the compoun nature of the process of attachment, in combining a proceeing in rent with a proceeing in personam, as inculcate in the case of Chilress vs. Fowler, nevertheless this writ woul be goo uner the reasoning an spirit of the case of Renner vs. Ree, because upon the face of it, the efenant is not only avise of the nature of the complaint in its being exhibite as a money eman, but he is avise of the precise amount sworn to by the plaintiffs, an has, therefore, a much more accurate ata upon which to prepare a efence, than the face of an orinary writ woul give. So far as facilities for efence are concerne — an this is the groun Upon which the jugment in Renner vs. Ree was base — when the efenant is avise that he is proceee against for a money eman, specific in amount an sworn to, an in a proceeing by attachment for service by seizure of property, we think it a sufficient notification to him of the nature of the complaint,‘to apprise him of the cause of action, an enable him to prepare his efence: more especially in view of our system of practice, which requires, that before any original writ shall issue, a eclaration shall be first file in the clerk’s office, there to remain, subject to the inspection of all parties. (Dig. Pr. Law sec 3.) An if the ecision in Renner vs. Ree unavoiably le to the consequence of holing the writ ba in this case, upon the objection taken, which it oes not, as we have seen, we woul be more incline to epart from that case an return to what we conceive to be the true spirit of the statute than to be governe by it.
We think there is nothing in the other point mae.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was a suit upon a bon given by the plaintiff in an action of forcible entry an etainer uner the statute, an the other efenants in error, who were his securities. The bon was given, payable to the efenant in the action of forcible entry an etainer, an who is the present plaintiff, but it is conitione strictly in accorance with the statute. The eclaration makes profert of a true copy of the bon, alleging that the original is on file in the office of the clerk of the Circuit Court to which the writ of forcible entry an etainer was returnable, an not within the power or control of the plaintiff: an after setting out the bon an conition assigns for breach, that upon the execution of the bon, the sheriff proceee to execute the writ by turning the.present plaintiff out, an putting the efenant, Gibson, in possession of the premises in question, an that such further proceeings were ha in the action of forcible entry an etainer, that afterwars, to wit, &c., “sai Gibson ismisse his sai suit an abanone an refuse further to prosecute the same, whereupon by the consieration an jugment of the sai court there,[a. jugment for costs was renere in favor of sai plaintiff herein against the sai Gibson, an a writ of restitution aware by sai court, which costs amount to a large sum, to wit, the sum of --- ollars,” all of which woul appear from the recor thereof remaining, &c., an avers that the sai efenant Gibson i not restore to the plaintiff the possession of the premises escribe, an i not, nor woul pay the sai plaintiff all such sums of money as were ajuge against him in sai action, an so the conition of the bon was broken an the same became forfeite, &c.
The plaintiff refusing to amen, after emurrer sustaine to the eclaration, final jugment went against him, from which he has appeale. The question is, as to the sufficiency of the eclaration, to which various causes of emurrer were assigne in the court below, an some of which will be notice.
The statute, Digest, Title, Forcible Entry an Detainer, sec. 7, provies that the writ of possession shall not be execute in any case, unless the plaintiff or some other person in his behalf shall execute a bon to the sheriff or other person, in a sum at least ouble the value of the property specifie in the writ, &c. The “other person” in the statute oes not refer to the efenant in the action, but means that the bon shall be execute to the sheriff or other officer to whom the writ is irecte, an who may be charge with its execution, as for instance, the coroner, or in extreme cases, the constable, where the offices both of sheriff an coroner happen to be vacant. Thompson vs. Bremage, at this term. See Digest, Title, Replevin, sec. 10, from which the section in question was, no oubt, intene to be copie. The efenant in the action of forcible entry an etainer might have ha the bon prouce by a rule upon the sheriff, an woul not be boun to accept it, if essentially informal, variant from the statute, or efective in the conition, an might have obtaine an orer upon the plaintiff to furnish a sufficient bon, on paiii of having his suit ismisse with jugment of restitution.
But the efenant in the action of forcible entry an etainer appears to have acquiesce in the form of the bon, an has signifie his acceptance of it by the present suit. It oes not lie in the mouth of the plaintiff in the action of forcible entry an etainer to question the sufficiency of the bon or its valiity uner the statute, nor ought they to be allowe to escape from it, if it can be uphel as. a common law obligation. It was execute to enable the principal to obtain possession of the property in controversy, an was a conition preceent to the execution of the writ: it was execute voluntarily an not uner any uress, is not contrary to public policy or goo morals, an not forbien by any statute, or calculate to efeat its object. Nunn vs. Goolett, 5 Eng. 89. See authorities collecte in Whitset vs. Womack, 8 Ala. 475.
The allegation that the bon sue upon is on file in the clerk’s office, an which is but inucement for the conclusion that is not within the power or control of the plaintiff, oes not come up to the allegation in Nunn vs. Goolett, that Hie bon was of recor, an though confesse by the emurrer, oes not show any sufficient excuse for not proucing the original. The allegation that a paper is on file oes not necessarily imply that it is so by authority of law, as to make it a recor or a part of the recor of any particular suit, unless from the character of the paper, the court woul have to conclue that it was a matter of recor. But if equivalent, this point was not notice or ecie in Nunn vs. Goolett. The law has provie epositories for official bons, an makes a certifie copy, evience in lieu of the original. So bons for attachment an injunction, being prerequisites to the issuance of the writ, have to be file with the clerk, so that if not technically an for all purposes a part of the recor, of the particular suit or proceeing, they certainly are public recors an in legal custoy. Wilson vs. The State, 5 Ark. 513. So elivery bons are require to be returne with the execution, an become part of- the recor as the founation of ulterior proceeings. In none of those instances woul the legal presumption be that the plaintiff ha the right to the possession of the ee or instrument eclare on; an though he ought to make proferí of an authenticate copy for the ai of the court, an the information of the opposite party, Aams vs. the State, 1 Eng. 504, he is uner no obligation to prouce the original, which remains subject to the inspection of all persons intei’este. '
But the bons in replevin an forcible entry an etainer are not require to be returne an file so as to become in any sense a part of the recor, unless mae so by some proceeing or exception taken uring the progress of the cause. They are taken an hel by the sheriff for the benefit of the efenant, an aré to be assigne to him, if jugment be renere for him in the action. This assignment follows of course, an the court will orer it as a matter of right on the application of the efenant, in case the sheriff shoul refuse. So that when the efenant brings suit on such a bon, it is in legal contemplation in his possession, or uner his control. It may be lost or estroye, or for some unusual cause, beyon his control, but this ought to be shown, an to the extent that profert is necessary, in orinary cases, as an excuse for the omission.
There is nothing in the case of Nunn vs. Goolett which woul ispense with a succinct an accurate statement of the jugment or recovery set forth in any assignment of breaches. Without enquiring as to the proper moe of making the averment which the ecision in Butler vs. Owen, 2 Eng. 373, misapprehening Calwell vs. Bell & Graham, 3 Ark. 423, has left in some confusion, the rules of pleaing require that the plaintiff shoul set forth some certain amount ajuge to him for his costs, or if ajuge generally aver the amount uner a viclicit which woul let in proof of the true amount to which the costs were afterwars taxe. Shelton vs. Clark, 2 Eng. 194. As the property is immovable an the successful efenant can always be restore by-writ of restitution, his costs, an perhaps also the rents an profits accruing after jugment, if he oes not choose to avail him- • self of the writ of restitution, uner the construction given to the statute in Fowler vs. Knight, 5 Eng. 43, constitute the gravamen of the, breach. From so much of that ecision as hols that where the efenant succees he cannot have his amages assesse, but has his remey upon the plaintiff’s bon, we are not now prepare to issent further than to observe that, accoring to the conition of the plaintiff’s bon, it woul seem the efenant can have no remey upon it for any amages consequent upon eviction uner the writ of possession, or the intermeiate rents an profits, or even waste committe before jugment, unless recovere against the plaintiff in that action, so that the security affore by the bon, is a mere elusion an the omission in the statute to provie for the assessment of amages, where the efenant has jugment of restitution, is one caliing for’ prompt remey by the Legislature.

elivere the opinion of the court.
This was an action upon a proteste bill of exchange. The issue upon the plea of non-assumpsit, was submittte to the court sitting as a jury, an as no question of law was raise on the trial, it woul seem that the uly ascertaine fact in the case isr that the efenant i not unertake or promise as allege in the eclaration. The plaintiff, however, has brought the case here upon exception to the overruling his motion in the court bel.ow for a new trial. The testimony, epositions an exhibits set out in the bill of exceptions, sprea over near thirty pages of the recor, the whole of which might have been conense, on a case mae for this court, so as to present the single question, argue here for the appellant, into the following statement of facts.
Burr, a merchant of Batesville, having funs in the hans of Walton & Sheaffe, of New Orleans, rew a bill on them, which they accepte, an which came to the appellant by enorsement. The bill mature on the 17th May, 1846, which being Sunay,, it was uly presente to the acceptors an proteste for nonpayment on the 16th. The only proof of notice to the rawer is-that containe in the eposition of the notary, who states, “I ghve notice of such protest to the rawer by a letter aresse to him, bearing ate the same ay of the protest, an irecte to him at Batesville, Arkansas, which letter I eposite in the post office, in the city of New Orleans, on the 18th ay of May, 1846, in time to go by the first mail thereafter.” There was no evience as to the usual'times for eparture of the mail. It oes not appear at what hour, or whether any mail left New Orleans on Monay, by which the notice might have gone or at what time of that ay the notice was eposite in the post office.
Apart from the consieration that this court ought not to presume against the verict of a jury, or the court sitting as a jury, but rather in favor of it, so far as it might epen on the weight or creibility of testimony, an regaring iligence as a question of law, an giving the appellant the full benefit of the legal questions, by supposing the evience to be facts state, the question woul be whether the proof comes up to the mark of establishing ue iligence.
Accoring to the rule aopte by this court in Davis vs. Hanly, 7 Eng. 645, the holer was not oblige to eposit the notice in the post office on Monay in time to go by the mail of that ay, if it went out too early to allow notice to be prepare conveniently within .business hours, but he ha until a convenient hour of that ay, for putting the notice into the office, an the first regui ar mail thereafter, though it i not go out until the succeeing or some subsequent ay, woul be the next convenient or practicable mail; an the law woul hol this to be sufficient iligence on the part of the holer to charge the rawer. This is in accorance with the opinions of the court, in Lennox vs. Roberts, 2 Wheaton 373, as qualifie by the Bank of Alexanria vs. Swann, 9 Peters 33, an with that qualification now generally recognize to be the correct rule, that “a eman of payment shoul be mae upon the last ay of grace, an notice of the efault of the maker put into the post office, early enough to be sent by the mail of the succeeing ay,” unless the mail of the succeeing 'ay goes out at an unreasonably early or inconvenient hour.
But the burthen of proof being on the plaintiff to show iligence, it follows as a necessary consequence of that rule that it is incumbent on him to prove such facts as will bring himself within it, Downs vs. The Planters Bank, 1 S. & M. 276, else the result woul be toleration of a ifferent rule, that the holer or intermeiate enorser receiving notice, ha all of the succeeing ay after protest or receipt of notice within which to eposit notice in the post office, so that it woul be sufficient if it went out by the mail of the thir ay, which as we have seen, is not the rule aopte by this court, nor so far as we are aware, generally recognize, either in Englan or by the courts of this country.
Diligence oes not epen alone upon the fact of putting the notice in the post office in time to go by the mail of the ay succeeing the protest, because, if no mail leaves on that ay for the place to which the notice is irecte, it woul be sufficient to prove that it was eposite in the office on any subsequent ay, in time to’ go by the first regular mail which left after the ay of the protest. An uner the qualifie rule before state an a here to by this court, the test of ue iligence on the part of the holer is not merely the putting of the notice in the post office on the ay succeeing the protest, unless couple with the further proof that it was eposite in time to go by the mail of that ay, if one left uring convenient business hours, an if no mail left uring those hours, then the presumption woul follow, of course, in favor of iligence, that it was in time to go by the next regular mail after that ay. But in the absence of any such proof in the power of the holer to make, the presumption woul be against the exercise of ue iligence unless eparting from the rule, we aopt a ifferent one, i.e., that the notice is sufficient if put into the office in time to go by the first mail which leaves on the secon ay after the protest. The like presumption to be inulge against the party whose uty it was to make out a case in proof, woul have warrante the court below in inferring from the statement of the notary that he eposite the notice in the post office in time to go by the first mail that left after Monay, an not the first mail that left on Monay after the hour of putting the notice into the office; but upon the groun on which our ecision rests, all such critical construction of his statement becomes unnecessary. The proof is insufficient, because it fails to show irectly or by any fair inference that the notice was eposite in the post office in time to go by the first convenient mail, if any, which went out on Monay.

It appears from the recor in this case that Pope, the intestate, execute his note to the appellant, which became ue on the 1st ay of July, 1844. That Pope ie on the 20th ay of July, 1845, an aministration of his estate was grante to the appellee on the 15th ay of August following. The claim having been probate, was exhibite to the aministrator oil the 29th ay of April, 1847, an rejecte by him. The plaintiff file the claim in the Probate Court on the 6th of July, 1847, an on the next ay, as shown by the recor entry in the Probate Court, the parties appeare, an by consent it was orere by the court, that the cause be continue until the next term. The cause was, at several subsequent terms, continue at the instance of the Bank, an upon her motion, successive writs of summons were sue out against the aministrator, one of which was returne serve on the 30th of July, 1849, an at the October Term, 1849, the parties appeare an the efenant entere his plea of the statate of limitations, to which the plaintiff joine issue, all in short by consent upon the recor, an the court sitting as a jury, allowe the claim, an classe it in the 5th class, to which the efenant excepte, an on his appeal to the Circuit Court, the jugment was hel to be erroneous, an atrial e novo aware, in which on the same state of fact, the court foun for the efenant on the issue between the parties an gave jugment accoringly, to which the appellant excepte.
As heretofore hel by this court, the appearance of the efenant, an his consenting to a continuance is a substantive act, ispensing with the service of process. Rogers vs. Conway, 4 Ark. 70. The efenant must therefore be consiere as having notice of the application for allowance to the Probate Court, an as being in court for all the purposes of the suit from that time forwar.
In the case of Etter vs. Finn, 7 Eng. 634, it was the opinion of the court, that, though as a general rule, where a statute commences running, it continues to run until the bar becomes complete, such general rule ha been qualifie by this court upon the authority of the ecisions in the courts of Marylan, Tennessee, North Carolina, Mississippi, an Alabama, as woulbe seen by reference to the case of Aikin vs. Bailey, 5 Eng. 584, where the eath of aparty has been hel to prouce a temporary suspension of the operation of the statute, for then there are no parties competent to be sue. As for instance, if the payer of a note shoul ie after the statute ha commence running, but before the statute bar ha mature, the time between the eath of such party, an the substitution of a new party, executor or aministrator, woul not be estimate in computing the time of the statute bar.
If, therefore, we are to regar the plea of the statute of limitations interpose, in short, by the aministrator’, as being the general statute of three years, the exceptions to the ecision of the Circuit Court must be consiere as well taken, because upon the facts proven, if the time between the eath of the intestate an the grant of aministration be exclue, three years ha not elapse from the accrual of the cause of action, until the institution of the suit ]oy the voluntary appearance of the aministrator in the Probate Court, an in this view of the case, the jugment of the Circuit Court is erroneous.
But the efenant coul have the benefit of the general statute of limitations as a plea thus informally interpose, only on the supposition that the claim was barre by that statute before the eath of his intestate. Because, although we have consiere the case with reference to the ecision in Etter vs. Finn, which was that upon the eath of the ebtor, the statute is suspene until the grant of letters, an then resumes its course, an have conclue that, even if governe by that ecision, the efence is not sustaine, yet in our opinion that case oes not furnish the rule of ecision.
During the present term, in the case of Walker a. vs. Byers, after a thorough examination of the subject, an a review of the previous ecisions of this court touching the point, we have solemnly hel that the two years statute of non-claim, gives the rule as to claims against the estates of ecease persons, an not the general statute of limitations; that is to say, that uner our a-, ministration system, as regulate by statute, when, a party ies, all subsisting claims against him, not then barre, are put on the same footing, an may be presente an allowe against his estate, at any time within two years from the grant of letters, an if not presente within that time are barre, without any saving or exception in favor of isabilities, an without reference to the length of time such claims might have ha to run as against living persons uner the general statute.
When we apply this rule to the facts of this case, it is beyon question that the claim was not barre; because the aministrator appeare in the Probate Court on the 7th of July, 1847, an within two years from the grant of letters, to resist the allowance an classification; he having rejecte the claim when it was presente to him uly authenticate on the 29th of April following.
The jugment of the Circuit Court must therefore be reverse, an the cause remane with instructions to affirm the jugment of the Probate Court.

B. F. PAYNE, Clerk,
By W. S. Walker, Deputy Clerk'.
It also appears by the transcript of the proceeings of the Probate Court, that the cause was twice continue in that court by “consent of parties,” before it was finally hear an etermine there; an upon the latter groun it is insiste here that the want of authentication (if this court shoul hol the affiavit insufficient) was matter in abatement; an therefore the motion for non-suit, after these continuances, was out of time.
In the case of Ryan et al. vs. Lemon a. (2 Eng. R. 78) this court conclue upon this point that this objection an motion might be mae at any time prior to final jugment, an at the present term, in the case of Walker a. vs. Byers, we have hel that the objection, for want of authentication, might be taken either by plea, on motion, or by way of objection to the amissibility of evience offerre to establish the claim. There is therefore, nothing in this objection.
Another question, however, is irectly raise upon this recor, an it is the only remaining one involve in the cause; an that is, as to the sufficiency of the authentication. The promissory note, on which the claim is foune, is payable to Beirne & Burnsie. It oes not appear to have been enorse to any one, an the proceeings for its exhibition are in their name, while the affiavit, in ue form, as provie by the statute, appears to be mae by Thomas M. Cory. Is this such an authentication as is contemplate by the statute ?
The authority of the Legislature to enact the law, requiring one who has a claim against the estate of a ecease person to authenticate his claim by his own affiavit, before evience shall be hear to sustain it, may be safely assume. There can be no pretence that such a regulation cuts off all remey, or that it clogs it in any such egree, even upon small emans in favor of istant creitors, as to be obnoxious to the objection that the obligation of the contract is thereby impaire within the meaning of the constitution. Although the cost of an affiavit might be greater than the amount of the claim authenticate thereby, it woul be no more onerous upon the claimant to avance the amount than it woul be to avance the cost of a writ in an orinary proceeing, when his claim might be less than the cost of the writ. No constitutional question then will be consiere as involve in the point that we are to etermine. An there is no question as to whether or not this is such a claim as is require by the statute to be authenticate, as there was in the case of Walker a. vs. Byers. Nor is any question presente whether, when there are joint claimants, the affiavit of one of them only sufficiently authenticates the claim. The precise question here is, whether the affiavit of Cory, who oes not appear as a claimant at all, is sufficient authentication within the provisions of the statute.
It is insiste.that by a fair an sensible construction, the affiavit of any one, who can make it truly from his own knowlege of the facts, woul be sufficient authentication, whether it be that of the creitor,'or one of them, or his or their agent, or attorney, or other person, or at any rate if it be that of the agent, or attor-5 ney.
It may be remarke in the first place that so much has been expresse by the Legislature on the point, in an unambiguous manner, that but little is left to be interprete; an that little must necessarily be interprete in irect reference to the general policy of our aministration system; of which the enactments in. question constitute a part. All claims are to be barre unless exhibite properly authenticate,” within the two years specifie (Dig. p. 125, sec. 85;) Both exhibition an authentication are the creatures of the statute, an are alike applicable to all claims, an the latter is a prerequisite of the former, whether the exhibition be the act of the parties or by means of a proceeing, either on the law or chancery sie of the Circuit or in the Probate Court. Executors or aministrators have to authenticate their own. claims against the estates committe to their hans by the “same affiavit require of other claimants,” (sec. 84). Actions pening against any person at the time of his eath, which survive against his executor or aministrator, are consiere as exhibite without authentication, (sec. 86). When a claim is exhibite by the act of the party out of court, the “ claimant shall appen to his eman an affiavit.” (sec. 88). When he exhibits by means of a proceeing in court, the affiavit must be prouce, an it must appear to have been mae prior to the commencement of the proceeing, (sec. 93). The general form of this require affiavit is prescribe, (sec. 88), an when authentication is mae in behalf of a corporation, or by an executor, aministrator, or assignee, a special affiavit prescribe, is eclare to be sufficient, (sec. 91). The officers, before whom affiavits are to be mae in this State, are specifie, an provisions are mae for their authentication, when mae beyon the limits of the State, (sec. 96). Persons who swear falsely in making the require affiavit are eclare guilty of perjury, (sec. 96). When a ebt is ue to a corporation, the cashier or treasurer is to make the affiavit, (sec. 90). If the ebt be assigne after the ebtor’s eath, the authentication is to be mae by means of both the affiavit of the person, who hel the ebt at the eath of the ebtor, as well as that of the assignee superae, the one in the general, the other in the special form prescribe, (sec. 92, 91), an it is in express terms provie that “ before any executor or aministrator shall pay or allow any ebt emane as ue from the ecease, the person claiming such ebt shall make an affiavit, as aforesai,” (sec. 89). An there are several other provisions touching exhibition an authentication, which, when all consiere together, seem clearly enough to show that the Legislature use as synonymous the terms, “ creitor” an “ claimant,” an the terms ebt, claim an eman. There is much light thrown upon the question at issue, by these various provisions, affirmative an negative, general an special. Perhaps, however, it is not necessary to look beyon the provisions of sections 89, 90, 91 an 92, when consiere together, anin generalreferencejonly to the policy of our aministrative system, to solve satisfactorily the point to be etermine. If it ha been esigne that the affiavit of the agent or attorney of the creitor shoul authenticate the claim uner any circumstances, the provisions mae for the authentication of a claim on the part of a corporation, woul* have been totally unnecessary.
So, if it ha been esigne that the affiavit of any person whomsoever, whether the creitor or his agent, or attorney, who coul make the affiavit truly from his own knowlege of the facts, shoul be' sufficient authentication, neither the provisions as to corporations, nor those as to assignees woul have been necessaiy, because, in the case of a corporation creitor, a knowlege of the facts on which the affiavit woul be base, necessarily lay in some natural person, who was not in contemplation of law the creitor; an in the case of claims assigne after the eath of the ebtor, such knowlege woul, in general, lay either in the holer of the ebt at the time of the eath, or of some other person, not the- assignee. Because, as to the assignee, it coul not be possible, in contemplation of law, that any thing coul have been pai on the ebt after the eath of the ebtor, an before its exhibition ; an any knowlege as to the original consieration, or of its failure, either before or uring this interval, woul, in general, be better known to some other person than the assignee.
So, also against the iea that any person may make the affiavit whose knowlege of the facts woul enable him to o it truly, an in such case the affiavit of the creitor may be ispense with, it is apparent, from this provision in reference to corporations, executors, aministrators an assignees, when those mae in reference to the latter are contraste with those in reference to the other three, that an affiavit is more reaily ispense with from a thir person, who coul make it positively upon his own knowlege, than from the creitor himself, who coul only make it on belief from information.
When then consiering together the provisions of the four sections we have groupe, in their connection with our aministration system an in irect reference to its policy, we think it perfectly clear that the Legislature has not only enacte affirmatively as a general rule, that the creitor in person must authen j ticate his claim by his own affiavit, but that rule is re-affirme by inevitable inferences from the provisions as to corporations, exeeutors, aministrators an assignees, which constitute the exceptions to, an limit an qualify this general rule as to who shall authenticate, an the moe of authentication.
This we conceive to be the true interpretation of the enactment in question, an it is in accorance both with the letter an the spirit of the statute. An nothing is to be inferre against it from the form of the affiavit prescribe ; which is eviently but a general form, applicable in its precise terms to ebts at maturity, upon which there may be creits enorse, an is, of course, to be often varie in its terms, so that the substance is preserve, to correspon withucases where the ebt may 'not have mature —may have no creits — when the claim may soun in amages, (Dig. p. 125, sec. 80), or he uncertain in amount, for want of the settlement of complicate accounts, sought by proceeings in court to be settle; in which latter cases the party coul only swear to the best of his knowlege an belief to some specifie amount of amage or balance ue him.
It but remains to be sai that we are of opinion that the suppose authentication in this case was insufficient, an fining n,o error in the recor the jugment must be«affirme.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
At the July term, 1847, of the Probate Court of Pulaski county, the following proceeings appear to have been ha : “ On this ay the claim of W. R. Overholt, against the estate of B. J. McHenry, ecease, amounting to the sum of $235 62, allowe by the aministratrix, an file herein for classification, on the 1 st ay of July, 1847. was taken up, an upon examination thereof, it is orere by the court that sai claim be place in class number four.”
At the January term, 1851, of the same court, Overholt file his petition, praying that McMorrin, who ha, in the meantime, become aministrator e íonis non, shoul show cause why he shoul not pay sai claim, so allowe an classe. In response to a rule against him, that went out accoringly, McMorrin appeare an set up by way of resistance to the application of Overholt for an orer of payment', first, that the claim ha never been legally allowe by the former aministrator, as the recor purporte: an seconly, that at the time of the eath of the intestate, Overholt was inebte to him for ivers sums of money specifie, an for boaring, &c., an introuce testimony on both points, against the objection of Overhojt, The Probate Court, however, mae the orer of payment for a pro-rata amount in favor of Overholt, an McMorrin file his bill of exceptions an appeale to the Circuit Court, where the oings of the Probate Court were affirme, an taking his bill of exceptions there also, he appeale to this court.
We have thus state so much of the mass of matters containe in the transcript (much of which has little or no relation to the orer of payment, which alone is questione by the exceptions taken), as to show istinctly the points of law involve.
We think the action of the Circuit Court was clearly right. The allowance an classification of the claim in question, whether right or wrong, ha become so fixe by the action of the Probate .Court, that all inquiry as to either was close after , the expiration of the term at which it was ha, otherwise than by a irect proceeing for reversal (Dooley et al. vs. Watkins, 5 Ark. R. 705. Cossitt vs. Biscoe, 7 Eng. R. 95. Boren et al. vs. State, use &c., 6 Eng. R. 519). The application for an orer of payment was substantially an application for process of execution, to which the allege matter of set-off was no answer. Payment of the claim allowe an classe was not pretene.
There is no error in the recor.

1862690,Walker as ad. vs. Byers,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott
elivere the opinion of the Court.
This cause was brought here from the chancery sie of the Inepenence Circuit Court, on the separate appeal of Walker. The original bill was file on the 13th ay of March, 1847, by Ichabo M. Manning, against Walker, as aministrator of James Pope ecease, an against William Byers : alleging that a certain partnership, which he particularly set out, ha existe between himself, Byers an Pope, in his lifetime, from the 12th of February, 1838, when it was forme, until the 24th of March, 1841, when it was issolve by mutual consent, an when an account, which he to some extent set out, was state between the partners, an the assets of the concern turne over to Pope an Byers to reuce to money, an pay towars the partnership liabilities, an account for the balance, if any, an praying an account an a ecree for whatever sum shoul be foun ue to him, against Byers an Walker, as aministrator of Pope, the latter having eparte this life about the mile of July, 1845, soon after which time Walker aministere upon his estate.
Byers answere, amitting many of the material facts, an ex j hibiting very fully an particularly the allege state account, at the time of the issolution, all the liabilities of the firm, an its assets of every escription, an the manner in which they ha been ispose of, an showing a consierable loss upon the whole transaction, allege that he was the sufferer, an praye relief against both Manning an Walker, as aministrator.
Walker, as aministrator, answere also, enying all personal knowlege of any of the matters state in the bill, refusing to amit any thing, an requiring strict proof, praye to be ismisse with his reasonable costs. Issues having been forme an epositions taken, the cause first came on to be hear at the June term, 1848, when, an account was ecree, an the matters referre to the master. At the March term, 1849, the master reporte, an at the same term Byers file his cross bill, to which Walker interpose by answer, the failure of Byers to authenticate his suppose claim, as provie by the statute; the special statute of non-claim, an the general statute of limitation, an enying the allegation, an requiring strict proof, praye again to be ischarge with his reasonable costs. Manning also answere the cross bill, an issues having been forme, the entire cause was hear at the September term, 1850, an the court not being sufficiently avise what ecree to rener, took time to consier until the 12th of January following, when at a special ajourne session, a final ecree was renere in favor of Byers, against Manning, an against Walker, as aministrator, from which the latter appeale to this court. From the foregoing statement of the case, it will be observe that the original bill of Manning was file about six years after the issolution of the partnership, an about one year an a half after the, grant of letters of aministration to Walker, on the estate of Pope. This original bill was not sworn to. Pope ie about four years an four months after the issolution of the partnership, an Walker 'aministere upon his estate about six months afterwars. The answer of Byers to the original bill of Manning, was file about five ays before the expiration of two years from the granting of letters of aministration to Walker. This answer was sworn to in the usual manner.
The cross bill of Byers was not sworn to, an it was file above four years after the grant of letters of aministration. The ecree appeale from is that renere by the court below, against Walker, as aministrator, an we shall first enquire' whether or not that ecree was authorize by the cross bill. We shall o so, because in the solution of that question we shall at once get at the real point of law involve in the case. To the cross bill, it will be remembere Walker interpose, by his answer, the three fol efence, that the allege claim of Byers was not authenticate against him as aministrator, in the manner provie by the statute, an was barre both by the general statute of limitations, an by the special statute of non-claim.
The consieration of this efence necessarily brings up several important questions, growing out of the statutory regulations touching the settlement an isposition of the estates of ecease persons, an the rights of those having claims touching an estate, either as creitor or otherwise. Some of these questions have not heretofore been fully consiere, an upon some isolate points of the general octrines involve, two or three of the ecisions of this court have tene to confuse, rather than to eluciate the points of law involve in the case before us.
We shall, therefore, in the course of our observations upon these questions, incientally notice these ecisions, an give to them such explanation an qualification as may be necessary.
When one ies an leaves an estate, what claims against it oes the statute contemp] ate shall be authenticate by affiavit, in the manner pointe out by its provisions ? An what is the true statute rule as to limitations? Does the general statute of limitations give the rule? or oes the special statute of non-claim, or both combine ? Or the one or the other, at the election of the representative of the estate? These are the questions raise by the ecree appeale from, if it is to be consiere as base upon the cross bill; an in that light, as we have alreay sai, we shall first consier whether it can be sustaine.
In orer to arrive at a correct conclusion on any of these points, it woul be very unsafe to rely upon any particular provision only of the statute, that might seem to relate irectly to the particular point to be etermine, much less upon any more minute groun of the mere phraseology of such particular provision ; because it seems perfectly clear when our numerous statutory provisions, touching the estates of ecease persons (all in response to our constitutional provision, on the same subject), are consiere together,that the Legislature i not esign merely to amen the ol laws touching the subject, but to create an set bn foot a new an complete system, which woul necessarily jnake raical changes in the law as applicable to living persons.
In proceeing to this extent, our Legislature has one but little more than to arrange an fix in a permanent system, applicable to all estates of ecease persons, whether solvent or insolvent, principles of equity, an of public policy, that in other States ha been often applie to the settlement of estates only that were insolvent, or settle by a resort to equity courts, an elsewhere in the common law ha been applie in' the settlement of claims in rem in general. Beyon this, however, an in combination with these principles, our Legislature has incorporate into this system a safe guar against frauulent claims, an against collusion, between frauulent claimants, an the representative of estates in requiring an affiavit from every claimant, which contemplates not only the protection of the just creitor but the istributee. An inee, the last remark, as to the istributee, is applicable to the whole machinery of our aministration system, which, in heging out the evils of elay so inseparably connecte with the settlement an istribution of estates, uner the ol law, as well as in all its other main objects, looks not alone to the interest of creitors, but has regar also to the interests of the heirs, or istributees, who are often minors, epenant upon the resiue of the estate for support an eucation.
In this system two capital objects seem plainly in view from the various provisions for their attainment; first, that the estate of every ecease person after eath, shall immeiately pass to the custoy of the law, to be aministere for the benefit of creitors, an after the satisfaction of all claims against it, that shall be presente within two years after the grant of letters testamentary, or of aministration, the resiue shall in the next place be passe to the heir, or istributee, quit of all claims against it, which the law will allow of, as against an executor, or aministrator.
The Probate Court is intruste with this custoy of estates, an that tribunal procees in rem to ajust the right of all persons intereste in an estate; an isposes of it in accorance with the provisions of the statute,'having for these purposes the most summary an plenary powers within the scope of its jurisiction, conferre by the constitution an the statutes, aministering both law an equity within this scope, accoring to the exigency of the right to be ajuicate upon.
In this process in rem, the executor, or aministrator is very nearly ientical with the assignee in bankruptcy. In his name, all rights, both against an in favor of the esl ate, are for the purposes of settlement an istribution, to be asserte in this tribunal an elsewhere.
In such a system, with a tribunal thus constitute, as its effective instrument, we think it clear that the claims an emans which the statute contemplates shall be exhibite to the executor, or aministrator in the manner provie by the statute, before the en of two years from the granting of letters, on pain of being forever barre, are all claims capable of being asserte in any court of justice, either of law or equity, existing either at the time of the eath of the ecease, or coming into existence at any time after the eath, an before the expiration of the two years — incluing, of course, all claims, or emans, running to certain maturity, although not yet payable, to be ajuste presently, upon equitable principles of iscount accoring to the rate of interest when mature, or to be provie for at the ay of maturity without iscount, an excluing such claims only as might be inchoate an contingent, like that in the case of Burton vs. Lockhart, (4 Eng. R. 412), an like ormant warranties, broken by eviction after the expiration of the two years.
In excluing such possible claims, inicate in the latter class, the statute oes not estroy them, only as against any aministrator, or executor, an in preferring to them all claims that exist at the eath, or come into existence at any time before the expiration of the two years, an therefore leaves them to be asserte against the heir, or istributee, as such, as a superior equity to his, in the assets that may have escene to, or been istribute to him after the estate of a ecease person has been .aministere for all the purposes contemplate by law. Whereas every species of claim or eman, either legal or equitable, which comes within the scope of the aministration, as we have efine it, will be forever barre, as well against the heir or istributee, as the executor or aministrator, if not exhibite in the manner provie by the statute, by the en of the two years.
From this exposition of our aministration system, an we can reasonably come to no other conclusion, than that this is the true one contemplate by the Legislature; it results that where one ies an leaves an estate, every claim or eman against it, for which it is liable, when in the course of aministration, in whatever manner asserte, must be authenticate by the affiavit of the claimant, as provie by the statute, because in no other way can a claim be exhibite, in accorance with the statute, to prevent its being forever barre.
To this general rule, however, the statute itself points out one exception — that of a suit pening against any person at the time of his eath, which, by law survives against his executor or aministrator, an although this express exception might seem to exclue all other by a common rule of interpretation, there are oubtless other exceptions, as for instance all proceeings on the part of the wiow, for ower: which are groune on a right in the property itself, out of which she is to get her estate of ower; proceeings for specific performance of a contract which o not seek to iminish the assets, that the law takes into custoy — scire facias, to revive a jugment against an executor or aministrator, because, such revival oes not operate to exhibit the jugment revive, affiavit being nevertheless require, when it might be presente for allowance an classification. Nor nee this enumeration of exceptions exclue the iea of other possible cases, that might not interfere with the policy of the statute.
This provision of the statute, requiring the. authentication of all claims against the estate of a ecease person, as a pre-requisite of their exhibition in some one of the moes pointe out by the statute — 'an unless exhibite they can never be lawfully satisfie out of the estate taken into the custoy of the law to be aministere — coul always be evae at the election of the executor or aministrator, if a failure to plea the want of the authentication was a waiver of it, because of the provision of the 170th section of the aministration act, which provies that “No executor or aministrator, or the security of any executor or aministrator, shall be mae liable for more than the amount of assets of the testator or intestate, on account of having faile to plea or make efence, or on account of any omission to plea, or mistake in pleaing, or false pleaing of any such executor or aministrator;” an therefore, it coul not have been esigne by the Legislature, that the want of authentication shoul be set up in no other manner than by way of a plea. Such an iea woul be irectly at war with so much of the esign of the Legislature, as relate to collusion between a frauulent creitor an the representative of an estate, because, whenever the representative might esire to facilitate a frauulent creitor, he woul either turn him over to the Circuit GoUrt in the first instance, or reject his claim, to give him an opportunity to go to the Probate Court, an in either case fail to plea the want of authentication without responsibility to himself or his securities, an thus efeat so much of the policy of the law. It must, therefore, have been the intention of the Legislature to have sustaine the policy of the law by some means beyon the mere interposition of the objection by means of a plea or motion, an cumulative of this means.
If the entire 170th section of the aministration act, which we have above copie, be hel to apply strictly to matters of efence, by means of the pleaings, which, we think was clearly intene, an that the provision as to authentication, was esigne to work such a change in the law, as to make all evience inamissible, to sustain a claim against the estate of ecease persons, until it ha been first authenticate, as provie by the statute ; then, in case the objection ha not been properly interpose by a plea or motion, it woul be the uty of the executor or aministrator, for the performance of which he an his securities woul be responsible, to insist on the objection, by way of an objection to the amissibility of any evience offere to sustain the claim, until it shoul be first mae to appear, on the part of the claimant, that his claim ha been uly authenticate before the commencement of the suit in which the evience was offere. This woul place him an his securities upon the same footing as to responsibility, as if uner the provisions of sections 88, 89, 97, 98, &c., of the aministration law, (Dig. 126, 7 & 8), he ha by his owp act out of court, allowe a claim without authentication. Accoringly we aopt this construction of the statute, an the consequence is that even in a case where the contract is in writing, an as against a living person, when the founation of a suit, coul be rea in evience without proof of its execution, unless enie by sworn plea, as provie by the statute, it coul not yet be rea in evience, (even if its execution were proven, as at common law), in a suit in the Circuit or Probate Court, against an executor or aministrator, until the authentication ha been mae to appear of a ate before the commencement of the suit, in which it might be offere in evience.
The next question we are to consier is as to the true statute rule operating upon claims against the estates of ecease persons. Does the general statute of limitations give the rule, or the statute of non-claim, or both in combination? As all ■claims, not exhibite within two years from the granting of the letters, are to be forever barre, it follows that however long a claim may have to run uner the general statute, it cannot sustain it even one ay beyon the en of the two years, an therefore, it is that to this extent at least, the general statute of limitations is isplace by the special statute of non-claim, because of the inconsistency of the two rules, unless the latter coul come in like a proviso an cut the former own. An if, in the onwar course of the general statute of limitation, it woul run out on a given claim the same ay that the two years woul expire, which woul be a case in principle like where the general statute was cut own by way of such a proviso as that suppose, one or the other woul be useless, because they woul both perform the same office in sustaining the claim in full life, if it be true, that both are applicable. But it is not true in such a case that they both perform the same office, because the claim is sustaine in full life, not because an action was commence upon it, within a certain time after an action accrue, but because it was exhibite before the en of two years after the granting of letters. If it ha not been exhibite within this two years, it woul have been barre, however short the time since an action ha accrue, or although no action at all ha accrue, upon a ebt not yet ue, but running to certain maturity. It woul seem then clear enough that, in such a case as this also, the rule of the general statute of limitation was isplace by the rule of the special statute of non-claim, because the former coul be of no use at all to either party, there being no place left for its operation, either in itself or in combination with the special statute of non-claim.
It has been suppose, however, that where the general statute runs out before the expiration of the two years, it might operate as well as the special statute of non-claim, because there woul be then some place left for its operation that woul not be inconsistent with the operation of the latter, an therefore it may be relie upon at the election of the executor or aministrator.
This iea is foune upon a misconception of the true nature, an the true rule of the statute of non-claim, an in consequence assumes as true, what is not true, in supposing any place is left, even in this case, for the operation of the rule of the g eneral statute. The statute of non-claim is itself but a statute of limitation, an is nothing else. The most plainly marke istinction, that has ever been rawn between them by the ajuge cases, was that the executor or aministrator was boun to plea the statute of non-claim, but coul plea the general statute of limitation or not at his election. An this was base upon the groun that statutes of non-claim were for the benefit of estates, an of creitors an heirs, intereste in them, an that the executor or aministrator was a trustee"" for them. But even this istinction may be challenge as soun law, the learning upon which it is base being as well applicable to the general statute of limitation as to the special statute of non-claim, an is parcel .of the exploe iea, that an executor or aministrator may revive a ebt against his testator or intestate, by a part payment, pr an express new promise at least, which grew up uner a theory, that regare the executor as the owner of the estate, an responsible not only to the extent of assets, but to a greater extent, if he i not show in efence that he ha fully aministere, ,an therefore cannot be tolerate in a system where, for most purposes, he is regare only as trustee, or assignee, an cannot bin the estate by any contract of his own, an where nothing short of a contract by the party to be boup, can revive a cause of action barre by the statute of limitation. But while the nature of the two statutes is ientical, the rule given by each is essentially ifferent. The one bars causes of action, if the suit be not commence within a given time after accrual; the other, having a wier scope, bars all claims an emans, without regar to the time of accrual of the cause of action, if not exhibite within a fixe perio of time. The statute of non-claim is like the statute of limitations that existe in early times in Englan; before the first general or prospective statute, in being temporary, an in running off from a fixe point of time; as from the first laning of 'King Richar, the 1st, an not unlike our earlier pre-emption laws. In both instances the experience uner the operation of the temporary enactment proving the goo policy of prospective an permanent enactment-
As a mere statute of limitations then, giving a rule of limitation which rums, not from the accrual of the cause of action, but from the granting of the letters, if the general statute still operate there woul be two limitations operating at the same time upon the same eman, one of which was foune on policy, which ha been itself entirely isplace by the substitution of a new system, esigne by irect means to effect at once the very object that the policy overthrown sought to achieve, by means of stimulating, merely, speey settlement between ebtor an cre^ itor.
This system, assuming to make all such settlements at once upon the eath of any ecease person, an forthwith taking the custoy of all available assets, calls for the exhibition of all subsisting claims, upon pain that all such shall be forever barre, if not exhibite by the expiration of the two years from the granting of the letters, an staying all process in the courts, except such as shall be neeful for the exhibition of emans. In effect regaring the whole perio, from the time of the eath to the expiration of the two yeai’s from the granting of letters, as a single point of time, for purposes of exhibition of claims subsisting at the time of the eath, or which may come into existence at any time before the expiration of the two years.
Uner such circumstances, to suppose there was any place left for the operation of the general statute of limitations, woul be to suppose that a rule base upon a particular reason coul properly have operation in a case without the reason, or coul exist where the reasons on which it reste ha no longer existence.An if this was not so, all that policy of our aministration system,which looks to the speey settlement of estates, that istributees an legatees may, as soon as practicable, be place in the enjoyment of their rights in the resiue, woul, in general, be entirely overthrown. We therefore think-this court was correct in coming to the conclusion, in the case of Erwin, use vs. Turner, surviving amr. (1 Eng. R. 14), that the general statute of limitations was esigne to operate upon the rights of parties while living, an was not esigne to apply after eath to claims against the estates of ecease persons, the statute of non-claim, as to such estates, giving the rule of limitation, an was wrong in holing the contrary, in the case of Etter vs. Finn, as amr., 7th English R. 632. Although the principle, for which the case of Aiken vs. Baily (5 Eng. R. 584), was cite as authority in that case, is unoubtely soun, an is applicable not only to the general statute of limitation, but also to the statute of non-claim, in a proper case, as where the first aministrator might ie, or resign within the two years, an some time might elapse before a secon aministrator shoul be appointe, the time uring which there was actually no aministrator, woul not be compute as a part of the two years.
We think that this court was also wrong in holing, in the cases of Burton, amr. vs. Lockhert, executor, 4 Eng R. 412, an in Allen vs. Byers, amr. (7 Eng. R. 593), that the statute of non-claim runs from the accrual of the cause of action upon the claims respectively. In the first case the claim sprung into existence from a ormant an contingent state, some time after the expiration of the two years from the grant of letters, an was therefore brre forever, as against an executor or aministrator, an coul only have been asserte, as against the heir or istributee, to be satisfie out of any resiue of estate escene or istribute. The secon case was where a security ha pai a ebt after the expiration of the two years, an was consequently a claim of the same escription.
If, however, he ha pai the ebt an exhibite his claim before the expiration of the two years, it woul have been entitle to share against the estate as other claims exhibite in ue time. The authorities, upon which the latter ecision was base, were from States whose aministration systems iffer from ours in taking the assets of an estate into the custoy of the law, only in cases where the.estate is insolvent, an where the statute of non-claim is not construe as isplacing the general statute of limitations as to claims not arrive at maturity.
In the light of these views then, it is clear that the ecree in this case cannot be sustaine upon the cross bill of Byers, because there is no pretence either that the cross bill was sworn to, or that it was file, until long after the expiration of two years from the grant of letters of aministration to Walker.
This first view of the case at bar having mae it necessary that we shoul examine the octrines iscusse in orer to etermine the two points settle, we will remark before proceeing to the next view, as they are questions of some importance, that we have examine them with care, an have not etermine them until after consiering their probable consequences. An in these we see no probable evils at all to be weighe against the manifest goo to be achieve by stimulating the speey settlement of estates, in accorance with the unmistakable spirit of our aministration system, palpably manifest.
In the next place, Byers insists, that as his answer to the original bill of Manning against himself an Walker, as aministrator, was uly sworn to; was file before the en of the two years from the granting of the letters, containe all the material matters subsequently set up in the cross bill, an was sustaine by' the proofs, that therefore the ecree in his favor against his co-efenant, Walker, can well rest upon these pleaings an proof,, irrespective of the cross bill, uner the rule, which uner certain-circumstances, allows of ecrees over between co-efenants, or of cross ecrees between them, foune upon the justice an: equity of the whole case. Such a practice is allowable when such cross ecrees can rest upon the matters state in the bill, an amitte by the efenant, sought to be change by his' co-efenant, either by suffering the bill to be taken as confesse, or by irect amissions in his answer.""
But no case is cite that goes the length of allowing a ecree in favor of a efenant against his co-efenant, on matters state in the answer of the efenant, in whose favor the ecree is renere, which the efenant ecree against, ha no opportunity to respon to by pleaing an evience, as he woul have ha if thosfe matters ha been state in the original bill. An this is precisely the state of the case before us, an although Byers was entitle to a ecree against the plaintiff, Manning, for any balance foun in his favor, upon the settlement of the accounts which he ha emane by his bill, because by this eman of a settlement of accounts, he thereby gave a plege that he woul submit to a ecree for any balance foun against him. (Hoo & Wife vs. Lee, 5 Monroe's R. at p. 66). There was no-such plege, either express or implie, between Walker, as aministrator, an Byers, an Walker ha no opportunity to respon to any other than the matters state in the bill, while the-ecree against him is foune upon the matters state in the answer of Byers, to which he ha no opportunity to respons The general rule is istinctly state to be (Daniel's Ch. Pr. 3 vol. p. 1743), that “ one efenant cannot have a ecree against a co-efenant without a cross bill, with proper prayer an process, or answer, as in an original suit,” an a efenant can, in general, pray for nothing in his answer but to be ismisse the court. If he has any relief to pray for, he must o so by a bill of his own, or by answer in the nature of a cross bill, uner the provisions of the statute, Calhoun vs. Erwin, 4 Ala. R. 452. Cummins’ heirs vs. Gill’s heirs, 6th Ala. R. 562; Morehea vs. Prater an Smiley, 1 Bibbs R. 316; Shelby & Roberts vs. Smith’s heirs, 2 A. K. Marshall’s R. 514; Talbot vs. McGee, 4 Monroe R. 378), an if he seeks such relief against a co-efenant, by this statutory means, he must, after answering the original bill, procee to charge his co-efenant as he woul by a regular cross bill, an take steps to get his answer, because otherwise, although it might be in the nature of a cross bill, as against the complainant, it woul not be as against his co-efenant, (Talbot vs. McGee, 4 Monroe, 378, Shelby & Robertson vs. Smith’s heirs, 2 A. K. Marsh. R. 514.)
But in this case, if Byers ha shown himself to be within any exception to the general rule, thus lai own, so as to be entitle to a ecree against his co-efenant, Walker, upon the pleaings an evience, his ecree against Walker coul not be sustaine, because it woul have neither pleaings or evience to rest upon. The bill of Manning was not sworn to, an although Walker might be consiere as having waive this objection as to him, by reason of his never having in any way taken this specific objection to the proceeings by him, he cannot be suppose to have waive it as-to Byers, either as to the pleaings or the evience, because, in resisting the only apparent effort of Byers to seek a ecree against him as aministrator, he expressly interposes this specific objection, which in all fairness shoul avail him, as well when Byers falls back upon the bill of Manning to sustain his ecree to any extent, as when he relies upon his own cross bill. When then he is allowe the benefit of the objection to this extent, it cuts out the bill of Manning as- to Byers, an with it falls Byers’ answer, which is a epenancy, an even if the pleaings were not thus overthrown, all the evience in the entire case was, as in favor of Byers an against Walker, incompetent as to Walker, in the face of his specific objection, for want of authentication staning in the recor, an insiste upon at the hearing.
The ecree then against Walker, as aministrator, cannot be sustaine, either upon the cross bill, or upon the pleaings an evience in the original suit of Manning. It is therefore unnecessary for us to examine Walker’s thir groun of efence, which is that the claim for an account against him as aministrator, was not a subsisting claim or eman at the eath of his intestate, for the allege reason, that it was then barre by the lapse of time, within the octrines applie uring the present term of this court in the case of Aams, amr. vs. Cree Taylor.
We are of opinion, therefore, that so much of the ecree of the court below, as is against the appellant Walker, as aministrator, ought to be reverse an hel for nought, that the bill an cross bill, as to him, ought to be ismisse,, an that he shoul recover his cost. Let this be one an this cause remane to the court from whence it came with instructions so to reform the ecree of that court, that all of it that now appeal’s either against the appellant severally, or against him jointly with Manning, may be set asie an hel for nought, an the resiue of the ecree be so forme that it may stan an be execute as a several ecree against Manning.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The action in this case was brought upon the official bon of a sheriff, against himself an his securities. After setting out the bon with its conitions, the plaintiff avers that Nancy Perry-man, for whose use the suit is brought, commence her action in replevin for slaves, against William Drew in the Sebastian Circuit Court, an sue out her writ of replevin, which, whilst in full force, was place in the hans of the qualifie eputy of sai Stephens, who was then sheriff of Sebastian county, by which he was commane that if the sai Nancy Perryman shoul give security as require by law, that he cause sai slaves to be replevie an elivere to her; that sai sheriff i, whilst sai writ was in full force, by his eputy, take sai slaves by virtue thereof into his possession. An the plaintiff then alleges, as a breach of the official uty of sai sheriff that he refuse to take bon an security as require by law, from sai Nancy Perryman; but frauulently intening to injure an cheat her out of the negroes, elivere them to sai Drew.
The secon count is in all respects like the first, with this ifference, that it is allege for a breach, that sai sheriff, by his eputy, took the slaves into possession, by virtue of sai writ, but woul not, an i not take bon from the sai Nancy Perryman as require by law, an wholly faile an refuse to o so.
To this eclaration a emurrer was file, the groun of which was, that the breach assigne in each is insufficient in this, that it was not sufficient to aver that the sheriff refuse to take a bon, fyc., or that he woul not take such bon, or i not take it, but that in orer to charge the sheriff for a breach of official uty, it was necessary to aver that the sai Nancy Perryman, or some one for her, execute an tenere such bon, as require by law, to the sheriff before he execute his writ, or took the property into possession uner it. The emurrer was sustaine by the Circuit Court, an the plaintiff having ecline to amen, final jugment was renere in favor of the efenants, from which the plaintiff appeale.
There can be no oubt but that the sheriff was not only not boun to take the property into possession, without first having the security require by the statute, but it was clearly his uty to esist from any attempt to execute the writ until such bon was tenere to him. The comman in his writ is conitional: that “if the plaintiff shall give you security,” &c., “you cause the goos an chattels to be replevie an elivere to the plaintiff,” &c.
The 10th sec. Dig. ch. 146, provies that such writ shall not be execute in any case, unless the plaintiff, or some other person in his behalf, shall execute bon, &c. An the 12th sec. provies “that upon the receipt of such writ an bon before require, the sheriff shall forthwith procee to execute such writ,” &c. No one can rea these sections without being satisfie that the sheriff exceee his power an authority in taking the slaves into his possession, without having receive the bon intene for the protection an security of the efenant, an that having one soj he was uner no obligation to retain the property so taken; inee, it was his uty at once to restore it to the efenant. The statute oes not require of the sheriff to prepare a bon, nor to eman one, but before he is authorize or require to execute the writ, it is the uty of the plaintiff to make, by herself, or some one for her, a goo an sufficient bon, conitione as require by the statute with sufficient surety, an to tener it to the officer. Then shoul he refuse or neglect to perform his uty he may be hel to account by the party injure; an shoul he, as in this instance, improviently take the property into his possession without first having receive such bon, (to place the case in the most favorable attitue for the plaintiff,) it was the plaintiff’s uty to prepare an tener such bon before the sheriff coul be hel accountable for not elivering the property to her.
The language use in the breach oes not necessarily imply that a bon was tenere. A “refusal to take a bon,” or in the secon count, “that the sheriff i not an woul not take a bon,” are not equivalent to a tener an offer of a bon, prepare as require by law. The grouns of the refusal or failure to take bon are not state. The plaintiff may have offere to prepare a bon, an the sheriff have ecline to hol up the property until it was one, or for other cause, an uner the rule'that the pleaer must be suppose to have presente the facts in the most favorable aspect for his client, we must presume that ha a bon been tenere an offere to the sheriff it woul have been so state.
We think the grouns for the emurrer well taken.

1862695,Viser vs. Bertrand,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins.
This was an action of assumpsit with a count for professional services, the common money counts, an an account state, brought by Bertran against Mrs. Yiser, the plaintiff in error. The bill of exceptions isclose a claim for $150, charge as an attorney’s fee, an $300 money avance for her, an at her request.
The evience on the trial conuce to show the following state of facts. Bertran ha been the attorney of Mrs. Yiser in prosecuting a suit in the Pulaski Circuit Court, against her husban for ivorce, an for his services in conucting that suit, the fee of $150 was charge. It appears that Mrs. Yiser ha several negroes, which she claime as her separate estate, but in which Yiser also claime- an interest by virtue of his marital rights 1 Mrs. Yiser, the complainant, was living in LittleRock, an Yiser, the husban, was in New Orleans. A negotiation ensue between the parties to that suit, through the meium of their respective attorneys, the result of which was, in the language of Yiser’s attorney, the only material witness to this point, that “Mrs. Yiser’s attorney agree that she woul pay me $300 for Yiser, if he woul relinquish his claim to the negroes an make no further opposition to the ivorce, which as Yiser’s attorney, I accepte.” The attorney of Viser wrote to him at New Orleans, an obtaine his ee of relinquishment of the negroes. The ee was execute to Bertran, an elivere to him, with the unerstaning that, after the ivorce, he was to convey to Mrs. Yiser. Bertran on behalf of Mrs. Yiser, gave his obligation for the payment of the $300. Subsequently, in July, 1850, Mrs. Yiser obtaine a ecree in the ivorce suit, Yiser making no opposition. The payment of the $300, was elaye for some time after the ecree, the excuse being that Mrs. Viser ha not succeee in raising the money by the sale of one of the negroes, as was intene, an which she mae some efforts to o. Accoring to my unerstaning of the recor there was evience conucing to show that Mrs. Yiser, after the ivorce, requeste Bertran to avance the money for her, until she coul raise it by a sale or mortgage of one of the negroes, or from which the jury might have inferre the fact of such request, which however, I o not regar as material. Finally, Bertran, who, not long after the ivorce, ha pai $100 aboutthe first of February, 1851, close the matter by giving his note for the remaining $200 to Yiser’s attorney, who accepte it with the unerstaning that he woul pay it whenever calle on; the witness, however, up to the time of the trial, ha not calle on Bertran for the money. There was abunant evience showing that after the ivorce Mrs. Yiser, the efenant below, acknowlege her inebteness to the plaintiff for his fee, which was agree to be settle at $100 an also for the $300 avance or assume to be pai by him for her to Yiser, an that she, on several occasions promise to pay him those sums.
On the trial in the court below, various instructions were aske for, the repetition of which in etail as given, moifie or refuse, woul be as little calculate to eluciate the ecision here as they were the issues before the jury. The points mae on behalf of the efenant below were, as gathere from the instructions aske, that as the retainer of the plaintiff an the contract or agreement about the payment of the $300, ha their inception whilst the efenant was a feme covert, such contract was absolutely voi an not bining on her; an being so, no subsequent promise by her, after she became iscovert, without some new or further consieration was shown to uphol it, woul amount to a ratification, or make such new promise bining upon her in law Seconly, that the plaintiff coul not recover for money pai, as to so much of the claim for which he ha given his note, an which i not appear to have been pai. The court below seeming to regar these propositions as law, instructe the jury on behalf of the plaintiff, that if they believe from the evience that the efenant mae a new contract, after the ivorce was grante to her, upon a sufficient consieration, to pay the $300 an the fee, they might nevertheless fin for the plaintiff uner the count upon an account state, but upon the return of the jury reporting a isagreement the court appears to have charge that, although the original contract was voi in law, yet if she mae a new promise to pay since she was ivorce, the consieration receive by her uring coverture, is sufficient to sustain such new promise, which became bining so as to authorize a recovery against her in that action.
It is certainly a rule of the common law that the contract of a marrie woman is voi. Her legal existence becomes merge in that of the husban, who, as he assumes her ebts, acquires as it were, a ominion of her estate as well as her person. She coul make no contract, the enforcement of which might eprive the husban of her society, or which coul be obligatory upon her, because of the legal presumption that it was mae uner uress. The wife may impose a liability upon the husbanby acting as his agent, by his express or implie authority, but then the contract is his. The husban being liable for her support an maintainance. the law will oblige him to furnish it, an in case of his refusal, where necessaries are furnishe to her, the law imposes the obligation an implies a promise on his part to pay for them. It woul seem that her contracts are voi by reason of incapacity to contract, an not voiable like those of an infant, to whom the law affors a protection, of which he may avail himself or waive at his pleasure.
But it has long been the establishe octrine of courts of equity, that in regar to her separate estate, the wife may have rights inepenent of, an averse to those of her husban, which will be protecte, an her liabilities in respect of such estate, enforce in that forum. When we consier the increasing tenency of legislation in this, as in other States, to emancipate the wife from the ominion of the husban, by securing to marrie women their separate property, an authority to acquire an hol it in their own names, ischarge from liabilities incurre by the husban, it behooves us to enquire whether it be the policy or esign of such legislation to exempt the separate property of the wife from liability, though it might have to be'enforce in a court of equity» upon her contracts in respect of such property. Wherever there is free agency an sufficient mental capacity, the right to contract, an the power of alienation ought to be inseparable from the ownership of property. It may inee be limite within the perio beyon which, the restraint woul become obnoxious as a perpetuity, so that where a separate estate is settle upon a woman in contemplation of marriage, the terms of the settlement an the powers conferre by it might have to be pursue in orer to enable the woman to charge her estate; yet it cannot be sai to be the policy of the law in this country, that property shoul be tie up from alienation, or absolve from the just ebts of the real owner; an the statute enabling marrie women to acquire an hol property irectly, instea of through the intervention of a trustee, is one of the many eviences of the isposition to o away with the istinction between law an equity, or rather to require courts oí law, in all cases where they are capable of afforing aequate relief, to aminister law in the spirit of equity.
Supposing in this case the money to have been fairly avance or assume to be pai, for the purpose of securing to the woman her separate property, or to quiet by way of compromise any oubtful claim of the husban to the usufruct', I apprehen it is not questione; but that the claim of the plaintiff below was such as coul have been enforce in a court of equity, an uring her coverture as against the property. The parties were living apart, an the treaty was concerning her separate property. So far from the husban being liable, he was the averse party in interest, an the wife by her agent or trustee, was contracting with him. The attorney thus acting as her agent, woul have a lien in equity upon the property for the moneys avance at her request, to secure her in the ownership or enjoyment of it. Even the court granting the ivorce, if satisfie of the fairness of the transaction, might have mae a summary orer, requiring the money so avance to be refune, an charging the payment of it upon the property ecree to the wife. Because to the .extent that a feme covert is capable of contracting, in a court of equity, she stans on the same footing with other persons, an is regare as a feme sole, uner no isability whatever. In the case of infants, who o labor uner a isability, where they avail themselves of the privilege, any court having the power, woul compel them to surrener an avantage or make restitution of property, which woul cease to be theirs, an be unjustly retaine upon the repuiation of the contract by which it was acquire.
So, a reasonable compensation for his services, to the attorney of a marrie woman, is chargeable upon her separate estate. If the suit is for ivorce, the complaint on the part of the wife, selom mae out of levity, but more often resorte to as a esperate remey for intolerable wrongs, though not to be encourage, is so far favore, that the court to which she appeals will eneavor to place her upon something like an equality with the contesting husban. If she have no separate estate the allowance to her for maintainance pening the suit, or for alimony by the ecree, are funs out of which she might be require to compensate her attorney. To eny to her the power of bining her estate for the retainer of competent professsional ai, so far from being an avantage, woul be to isarm her in a contest alreay unequal^ an require her to come into court efenceless save as an object of sympathy.
I am clearly of opinion, that if the jury believe the facts which I suppose the evience conuce to prove, (leaving out of view another feature in the cause to be presently notice,) the plaintiff below was entitle to recover upon the express promise of the efenant after she became iscovert, without any new or further consieration for the promise being mae to appear: an I rest my opinion istinctly upon the groun that the promise was bining, not by force of any mere moral obligation resting upon her, but because the contract or agreement mae uring coverture, whereby she receive an avantage, an the plaintiff below suffere a isavantage, was of such a nature as to be vali an bining upon her estate as a feme covert an a sufficient consieration to uphol her promise as a feme sole.
I o not unerstan the case of Lee vs. Muggrige, 5 Taun. 36, an the cases which followe it, to have been oubte or overrule, except to the extent of the loose expressions containe in that case, to the effect that any moral obligation is a sufficient consieration to uphol an express promise. The law is now well settle the other way, an without tracing the course of the ecisions, a correct exposition of it is containe in the more recent cases of Eastwoo vs. Kenyon, 11 A. & Ellis 438, in Englan, an Greer vs. Archer, 2 Barbour Sup. Ct. Rep. 420, among many ecie in this country. Strictly speaking, á moral, istinguishe from a legal obligation, an where there never was anything more than a moral obligation, is never a sufficient consieration to uphol an express promise. Many instances may be imagine where a person of refine feelings an cultivate min woul hol himself, or consier another boun by strong obligations of gratitue, where voluntary compensation might well be mae, but where no promise for future compensation coul raise the uty to the slanar of a legal obligation. Such uties belong to that class of imperfect obligations, bining in conscience, but whiclffihejlaw'fioes nofrecognize an will not enforce, because it cannot appreciate the consieration, or estimate the amages for a breach of uty. Inee, no greater change in the fabric of the common law coul well be conceive, than for the courts to put moral obligations upon a footing of equality with valuable consierations to uphol contracts. Besies the vague an inefinite nature of such obligations, the liability to unjust preferences of them over creitors whom the law has recognize as more meritorious, will suffice without any further conjecture, to illustrate the startling consequences that woul result from such a change. The rule euce from a review of the cases containe in the note, so often cite an approve, to Wennall vs. Abney, 3 Bos. & Pul. 249, exclues the iea of a mere moral obligation as a sufficient consieration to support a promise, by confining its operation to those cases where there was a preceent goo consieration to support an express promise, or from which the law woul imply a promise, which might have been, or coul yet be enforce, but for the operation of some'positiverule of law, as for instance, a ebt once vali an subsisting, but ischarge in bankruptcy, or barre by limitation, or the contract, of an infant which he may confirm at majority.
It may somtimes be ifficult to istinguish, between what are legal an what are moral obligations, but when ascertaine, the istinction has no peculiar application to the contracts of marrie women, or their moral obligation for benefits conferre. It is applicable alike to all persons who have full capacity to contract. If the agreement of a feme covert to contract is vali, so as to be obligatory in equity, her promise after she becomes is-covert nee not epen upon the moral obligation; nor is the promise of one, not uner a isability, aie by any moral obligation where there never was a preceent goo consieration.
. It is true the original contract of the efenant below, while a feme covert, coul not have been enforce against her in an action at law; but if I am right in concluing that it was one for her benefit, which equity woul sanction an enforce in her favor an against her estate, it woul seem to be a technical an unfoune istinction to hol that there was no consieration to uphol her subsequent promise, because the original contract coul not have been enforce at law. I take it to be the spirit of the rule given in the note to the case in 3 Bos. Sf Pul., that wherever the promisee ha a right, upon a goo consieration, of which he might have availe himself, at law or in equity, against the promisor, an whether in the prosecution or efence of a suit, such right, though it has become unavailing, is a sufficient consieration to uphol a promise to continue or renew the former liability. The case of Littlefiel vs. Shee, 2 Barn. & Aol. 811, where the plaintiff, a butcher, ha supplie the efenant, when a marrie woman, with meat for her own use, while her husban was abroa, an after his eath she promise payment, oes ilot militate against the position that the efenant may be liable upon her promise in this case, because there, supposing the eclaration to have been free from any objection, the court must have hel that if anyboy was liable to the plaintiff it was the husban, it being in law his ebt an not that of the wife, for whose subsequent promise there coul have been no consieration beyon the suppose moral' obligation. So, in the case of Watkins vs. Halstea, 2 Saun. Sup. Ct. Rep. 311, where goos were furnishe to a marrie woman living apart from her husban, an having a separate property hel for her by a trustee, an after being ivorce from her husban, she promise to pay for the goos, the court say, “It is not pretene that inepenently of the express promise of the appellant, after she obtaine her ecree of ivorce, this action coul be sustaine. If when the ebt was contracte, when the goos were elivere any person was liable it was the husban. We see nothing in the case to exempt him from liability. The appellant was then a feme covert an clearly not liable. Her promise to pay was mae after she was ivorce, an if that promise is not supporte by aequate consieration, the action must fail.” Assuming therefore, at the outset, that the original promise was not bining on the wife, an never coul have been enforce against her, the court go into an examination of the cases an unavoiably conclue that the moral obligation resting upon her was not sufficient to support her subsequent promise.
The other point of law raise by the instructions, is settle by the ecision of this court in Neale vs. Newlan, 4 Ark. 506. See also Logan vs. Williamson, 3 Ark. 216. R. E. Bank vs. Rawon et al., 5 Ark. 569, an Joran vs. Aams. 2 Eng. 348, that a negotiable note given an accepte in payment of a ebt of a thir person, becomes an extinguishment of it, an proof of this is sufficient evience to support an action against the ebtor for money pai. An upon so much of the case, as it come up on a motion for new trial, I woul see no cause to isturb the verict.
But the efenant below, in her motion for new trial, besies renewing the legal exceptions I have been consiering, an also urging certain matters of surprise an aitional evience, which are lai wholly out of view as insufficient, move for anew trial upon the groun, then for the first time presente to the court, that the original consieration for her liability to the plaintiff was illegal an immoral, in this, that the money was avance to inuce Viser, the husban, to withraw his opposition to her suit for ivorce, which if it be true, woul be a clear case of collusion, in violation of the spirit of the statute concerning ivorces, an contrary to public policy. An after some hesitation, because the efenant, moving for a new trial, seems to stan in the attitue of one, who shoul come into equity with clean hans, I thinlc the court below shoul have grante a new trial upon this groun — not for any merit in the efenant, much less a emerit in the plaintiff who may have been acting for what he conceive to be the best interest of his client; not that I can assume the fact to be as claime, because this as a question of fact was*-' not put to the jury or passe on by them; but because there was evience conucing to show that the money was pai to inuce Viser to make no further opposition to the ivorce, as well as to relinquish his claim to the negroes. An there being such evience, it was not only the right but th.e uty of the court to have interpose of its own motion, an put it to the jury to say whether this taint entere into an forme any part of the consieration, for which the three hunre ollars were pai, an to have charge them that if they so foun, the plaintiff as to so much of his eman, coul not recover. Because, otherwise, if both parties to an immoral contract, were content not to raise such objection, the courts might be compelle to ajuicate their allege rights uner contracts of that escription, which the law woul neither enforce nor rescin. It requires no enlarge inquiry into the policy of the statute concerning ivorces, to lea to the conclusion, that if money is avance or agree to be pai in consieration that a party to a suit for a ivorce will withraw opposition, it amounts to collusion. The statute requires, in suits for ivorce, at least a ecent show of opposition, an where that is wanting, the courts shoul look to it with increase vigilance, that the complainant’s allegations are fully sustaine by evience. If the money was avance for the purpose in whole or in part of compouning the suit, it coul not be recovere back from the party to whom it was pai, an the illegal taint woul enter into an vitiate any new promise to refun mae by the party, on whose behalf it was avance.
For this groun alone, an not upon any other containe in the motion, I think a new trial shoul have been grante.
Mr. Justice Scott.
None of the reasons for the motion for a new trial are tenable, as I think, except that which sets up, that in the groun of liability presente by the plaintiff below there was such gross illegality as to be justly offensive to goo morals an soun public policy, in this, that a part of that, for which he proceee, was for money avance to inuce Yiser, the husban, not only to relinquish his claim to the negroes in ispute, but to withhol his opposition to the suit of the wife for a ivorce. The former might well be uphel, because of the law’s high favor of compromises] but its abhorrence of collusion in a suit for ivorce, is so great, that relief shoul be at once given on such groun, even at the application of a particeps .criminis. It oes not give relief, however, in such case to the party, but to the public through the party, for the promotion of ecency an public morals. An it will be affore as well where there may be just emans unite with one so tainte, as where the latter may be the sole founation of the suit; because it is the public interest alone that the law thus seeks to subserve; an it was the party’s own folly to mix a rotten eman with a soun one.
Nor shoul this groun of interposition by the court be any the less regare, because it was not moote uring the trial in chief. So far from this, it is the bounen uty of the courts to guar the public morals of the country to the full extent of their powers, an for this purpose to interpose of their own motion for their vinication on all proper occasions. Nor oes any matter touching public ecency an soun morals, an the very pith of the Jeaven of social life, so much eserve the vigilance of the courts as this very matter of ivorce. The marital tie, although a civil .contract in the eye of the law, iffers from all other civil contracts in one essential particular. The parties can never annul it by means either irect or inirect. TIence the inexible rule of law, that the confessions of either party are wholly incompetent as evience. Nor oes our statute, which irects that “like pi'ocess an proceeings shall be ha in” ivorce cases (Dig. ch. 58 p. 462, sec. 3,) “as are ha in other cases on the equity sie of the court,” or in any other of its irections, or provisions, in any way alter or moify this vital rule of evience touching the issolution of the marital tie. Parties by their mutual consent, if of proper age an capacity to receive the sanction of the law, may make the marriage tie, but they can never break it accoring to the rul es of law an the soun morals upon which itrests, by any express, confessions, much less by those implie by a efault of answer to a bill for ivorce. A contrary rule, it woul seem, coul only be certifie to the courts by express legislation, pn even then, so great woul be the inevitable abuses in its aministration, that it might not be totally unworthy of consieration whether it coul have operation among men in harmony with the paramount laws of Go.
But for this groun of the motion for a new trial, it might well enough have been refuse, as it was, because leaving out of view this matter of illegality, in which the public was thus concerne, an which the evience seems to show to exist in fact, the verict an jugment were well enough sustaine. The compromise settle the property as the separate property of the wife, an certainly quoa this, she was a feme sole in a court of equity, an liable not only for her contracts concerning it, but also for others that touche her personal benefit, if not contrary to law; an it was not unlawful for her to sue for a ivorce an employ counsel to sustain her suit.
I concur with my brother juges in awaring a new trial.
Mr. Justice Walker.
This was an action of assumpsit brought by Bertran against-Mrs. Viser. The efenant pleae the general issue, an the-case was trie by a jury, who foun a yerict for the plaintiffiThe efenant file her motion for a new trial, setting out various causes for the same, amongst which it may only be necessary to enumerate those which affirm that the court erre in the-' instructions given, an in refusing to give instructions aske by the efenant an that the verict was contrary to the evience, to law, an to the instructions of the court. The motion for a' new trial was overrule an the efenant excepte, setting out the evience, an has brought the case here by writ of error.
The plaintiff’s action is foune upon two items of charge, the nature of which we will procee to consier. The first is for professional services renere by the plaintiff in obtaining a ivorce for her. These services were contracte for an renere whilst the efenant was a feme covert, an therefore the contract as to her was voi. The plaintiff amits this, but relies upon an express promise to pay after the ivorce, upon the groun that, although no legal obligation reste upon her to pay, that her moral obligation was a sufficient consieration for such, express promise. If this contract ha been voiable instea of voi (as if mae with an infant) the question woul have been more free from oubt. The point of ifficulty is whether, if no legal obligation, ever existe, a moral obligation can be sai to exist, such as will be a sufficient consieration to uphol an express promise to pay.
Upon examination of the authorities I think it may be sai that there must be such legal obligation or a legal an sufficient consieration, such as might have been enforce through the meium of an implie promise, ha it not been suspene by the incapacity of the feme covert to contract. Kent, in his Commentaries, part 5, vol. 2, p. 258, says, “A sufficient legal obligation to o a thing is a sufficient consieration for a promise to o it; but it has been an unsettle point, whether a mere moral obligation be of itself a sufficient consieration for a promise, except in those cases in which a prior legal obligation or consieration ha once existe. The weight of authority is that it is not sufficient.”
An it is lai own by Chitty in his work on Contracts, page 47, “That an express promise can only revive a preceent goo consieration which might have been enforce at law through the meium of an implie promise, ha it not been suspene by some positive rule of law, but can give no original cause of action, if the obligation on which it is foune never coul have been enforce at law, though not barre by any legal maxim or statute provision.” The same rule is lai own in 3 Bosanquet & Puller 244. Smith vs. Vare, 13 John. R. 258.
In the case now uner consieration, although no legal obligation existe uner which the efenant coul have been compelle to pay for the professional services, still such services were a legal consieration which but for the rule of law that makes voi the contract of a feme covert, a recovery might have been ha upon an implie assumpsit, an consequently furnishe a sufficient consieration to uphol an express promise mae after the ivorce to pay for them. Nor was it necessary in orer to make the express promise bining upon the efenant, to prove affirmatively that she knew at the time the express promise was mae, that she was not boun in law by her former contract. This, in the absence of evience to the contrary must be presume.
As regars the other item of charge, the $300, the facts are these. The complainant sue her husban for a ivorce, an also set up claim to several slaves, as her separate property. Defenant employe counsel an was preparing to efen, contesting the complainant’s title to the slaves; but upon a conference between the complainant an the efenant, through their respective counsel, it was propose that complainant woul pay efenant $300, if he woul relinquish his claim to the negroes, an make no further opposition to the ivorce, which terms were agree to, an at the request of complainant, the plaintiff in this suit an his associate counsel entere into an obligation to the attorney for the husban, bining themselves to pay him the sum of $300. This contract was entere into whilst the efenant in the present action was a feme covert. The relinquishment was procure from the husban by his attorney an elivere to the plaintiff, Bertran, who still (so far as appears from the evience) retains the same. No efence was mae to the suit for a ivorce, an after it was obtaine, the efenant repeately promise to pay the sum so secure by plaintiff an his associate counsel, Lincoln. But there is no proof that efenant requeste plaintiff to pay sai sum after she was ivorce. The payment of the $100, an the note for $200 seems to have been an arrangement between the plaintiff an the attorney for the husban without special irections or request from efenant, inee she at one time, expresse to Webb, a witness, fears that her attorneys ha not acte fairly with her, an ha in fact not pai the sum aforesai. The testimony of the other witnesses, it is true, acquits the plaintiff of all unfairness, but so far as the latter arrangement of payment is concerne, this goes to show that .representions ha been mae to her about the payment of the money, with regar to the truth of which she was not satisfie. In view of the whole of the evience, there can be no oubt of a full recognition of the contract mae whilst efenant was a feme covert, an of her promise to pay it after the ivorce; but there is no evience of any new contract mae after that time, nor oes it appear from a careful review of the whole of the evience, that Bertran, the plaintiff, took in the obligation of himself an Lincoln, an pai the f 100, an gave his note for the balance at the instance of the efenant or with her consent.
Waiving then the consieration of the question, as to whether .the promise to pay the $200, coul be given in evience uner the counts in the eclaration, the main question is, that conceing the money to have been pai either before or since the ivorce was obtaine, was this a preceent goo consieration which might have been enforce at law, through the meium of an implie promise, ha it not been suspene by that rule of law which enies the valiity of the wife’s contracts mae uring coverture.
The item of charge for professional services was alone encumbere with this positive rule of law. The subject matter of the contract was not against the law, or the policy of the law. But with regar to this latter item, the $300, a part at least of the consieration an inucement to the contract was, that the husban shoul offer no efence to the suit fora ivorce. This was clearly against the policy of the statute in regar to ivorces, uner the provisions of which, the particular grouns of complaint must be set forth in the bill an sworn to. An the complainant is also require to swear that the complaint is not mae through levity, or by collusion, fear or restraint, between complainant an efenant, for the mere purpose of being separate from each other, but in sincerity an in truth, for the causes in the bill set forth.
The contract of marriage, unlike orinary contracts of business, is one which the public, as well as the iniviuals contracting, is intereste in preserving unbroken, unless for such causes as are specially set forth in the statute, an these causes must in fact exist, an must be shown to exist by evience. No amissions of the efenant, whether by answer or by failure to answer, will supersee the necessity of proof of the truth of the allegations in the bill. An every contract not to efen or withhol evience which, if prouce, woul ten to isprove the allegations in the bill, is clearly in violation of the spirit of the statute, an shoul not be enforce.
This question was istinctly presente in the case of Sayles vs. Sayles, 1 Foster’s N. H. Rep. 312, in which the valiity of a contract not to efen against a suit for ivorce came up: an there no question arose as to the capacity of the parties to contract, because the husban execute the note, an the suit for ivorce was by him, not the wife, as in this case, so that the whole question turne upon the valiity of the contract, in reference to the subject matter about which it was mae. There the husban file his bill for a ivorce; pening the suit, conversations were hel between the counsel of the respective parties which resulte in an agreement by which the complainant execute a note for $400, payable to the son of the wife, an elivere to a thir person, with the unerstaning that if the complainant succeee in obtaining a ivorce, an if opposition to obtaining the ivorce was withrawn by the wife, then upon the application to the holer of the note, it was to be elivere up to the wife or her agent.
It appears that no efence was mae, an that the ivorce was obtaine an the note elivere up, an suit brought upon it. It was in proof that the consieration an inucement for making the note, was the withrawal of opposition to the ivorce an some contribution towars the support of the wife by the son to whom the note was execute. The efence set up by the husban against the payment of this note was, that the note was illegal an voi, as being against public policy. Upon this state of facts, the court sai, “The evience in this case pretty fully establishes a case of collusion between the parties, to obtain a ivorce at the hans of the court, when both parties knew or ha goo reason to believe that no sufficient legal excuse for it existe. No such agreement, even if execute, can form a vali consieration for either a verbal or written promise. The great an principal object of the agreement mae between the parties was, to bring about a issolution of the marriage contract, an to put an en to the various uties an relations resulting from it. A contract having any such purpose, object an tenency, cannot be sustaine in law, but must be regare as against soun public policy, an consequently illegal an voi.” In this case there was no want of capacity to contract, an the contract was reuce to writing an elivere up after the ivorce was obtaine, an yet it was hel upon grouns of public policy to be voi.
This rule is firmly establishe. The object of the law is to suppress vice, an to promote the general welfare of society, an no iniviual shall be assiste by the law in enforcing a eman originating in a breaeh or violation on his part of its principles. Chitty on Con. 673. Craig vs. State of Missouri, 4 Peters Rep. 410. 2 Humph. Tenn. Rep. 1. 1 Maule & Selw. 593.
An in the enforcement of this rule neither party has any just cause of complaint. It is true that the objection comes with a ba grace from the efenant, who has reape the benefit of this agreement by obtaining the ivorce; but it is not for her sake that the objection is allowe. It is foune upon principles of public policy, which forbis that courts shoul len their ai to one who founs his cause of action upon an illegal act.
Such being my view of th'e law governing the contract upon which the action in this case is foune, I will procee to consier such of the instructions of the Circuit Court as bear upon this point, the etermination of which shoul, I apprehen, suffice to settle the whole case.
The court, in my opinion, correctly instructe the jury that the contract of a feme covert was voi, an as relate to the $300, also correctly instructe, that asubsequent express promise mae after she became a feme sole, to pay such contract, woul not bin her; but then, I think, the court improperly instructe the jury, that if efenant mae a new contract upon sufficient consieration to pay the $300 an the fee, they might fin for the plaintiff; because in the absence of any instructions as to what was a sufficient consieration, the jury might have suppose the consieration upon which the contract was originally mae was sufficient to uphol the new promise, an it was objectionable also, because there was no evience whatever of any new contract, an therefore the instructions tene to mislea the jury.
The court also erre, in my opinion, in giving the instruction aske for by the plaintiff, the substance of which was, that a promise to pay after the ivorce, an before suit brought, woul, if proven, entitle the plaintiff to recover uner the account state; because, in orer to entitle the plaintiff to recover the $300, it was not only necessary to prove an express promise within the time as set forth in the instructions, but also that sai promise was upon a present or prior legal consieration, an so far from such being the case, to have mae the instructions full, an such as woul truly have applie to the state of the evience, the court shoul have instructe the jury that a contract mae in consietion (in whole or in part,) that the efenant, in a suit in chancery for a ivorce, woul make no efence to the suit, was against public policy an voi, an that if such appeare to them to be the case in this suit, they shoul fin for the efenant, so far as-the plaintiff’s right of action was foune upon such contract.
The last instruction given appears tome still more objectionable than either of these. It was that a valuable consieration receive upon the original contract, even though the contract might be voi, was sufficient to uphol a new promise to pay, mae after the ivorce. If voi alone because of the incapacity of the efenant to contract, then the instruction might have been sustaine, but when voi also, because the consieration was illegal, as in this case, it was the very reverse of the law as applicable to the state of facts before the jury,
I conceive it unnecessary to consier the other exceptions, as from the view which I have taken of the case, the plaintiff might well have recovere uner the count for professional services, but coul not, uner any form of pleaing, recover the sum of $300, assume-by him to the attorney for the efenant.
I am of opinion that the jugment ought to be reverse, an the cause remane with instructions to grant the efenant a new trial.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The most material inquiry in this case is, whether a person who settles on public lan an plants a crop can maintain trespass guare clausum fregib against one, who subsequently purchasing the lan from the Unite States, enters for the purpose of gathering an converting such crop to his own use. An although the question is not free from ifficulty, yet on principle an authority, we think it must be answere in the negative.
In Boyer vs. Williams, 5 Miss. 335, it was hel that a purchaser from the Unite States was entitle to all crops growing upon the lan at the time of purchase. An in Rasor vs. Qualls, 4 Blackf. 286, it was ecie that where a person having a preemption right to a tract of lan, permitte the time to expire without making the purchase, a stranger who afterwars purphase the lan from the Unite States, was entitle to the growing crop. An on a like principle it has been ecie by the Supreme Court of Illinois in Carson vs. Clark, 1 Scam. 114, an the Supreme Court of Mississippi, in Merrell vs. Legran, 1 How. 150, an by this court in McFarlan vs. Mathis, 5 Eng. 560, that a promise, mae by a purchaser of public lan after entry, to pay an occupant for improvements mae prior fo the entry, is withpqt consieration an voi. Every vali contract must be foune on a sufficient consieration an these cases rest on the groun that the occupant has no right of property in the crop or the improvements as against the alienee of the government, an therefore cannot recover in any action.
The case of Turley vs. Tucker, 6 Miss. 583, is an express au.thority to the point that an occupant of the public lan has not such an interest in timber cut by him as to enable him to maintain an action of trover against one who takes the timber away an converts it to his own use.
If there is no reservation or stipulation to the contrary, a conveyance of lan carries with it the growing crops, or as expresse by Spencer J., in Forte vs. Calvin, 3 Johns. 222, “the ownership of the lan raws after it that of the crops, an it cannot amit of a oubt that a sale of the lan simply, by the owner both of the lan an crop, carries the property of the crop to the purchaser.” 1 Leigh. 305. 7 Watts. 378. An in Gibbons vs. Dillingham, 5 Eng. 13, this court hel the same octrine, saying that “ the authorities are full a,n clear upon the point that where a party executes an absolute ee in fee of the soil an without an express reservation of the growing- crop, his interest in snch crop also passes by such conveyance.”
A sale by the Unite States falls within this general rule. The ^ lan, with the improvements an crop pass to the purchaser, (Carson vs. Clark, 1 Scam. 115. Boyer vs. Williams, 5 Miss. 335), an we think it can make no ifference whether the crop is severe or not. in either event it belongs to the owner of the soil, an such is the octrine of ajuge cases, which we think is maintainable on the principles of reason. Congress is investe 1 by the constitution with the power of isposing of an making neeful rules an regulations, respecting the public omain. In the exercise of this power lan offices have been establishe, officers appointe, the moe an manner of sales of the public omain regulate, an the manner by which the Unite States may be iveste of the legal title prescribe. Now every man is presume to be acquainte with the law, an hence the settle? on public lan is boun to know that when the lan, upon which he may resie, comes into market agreeably to the laws an regulations of the Unite States, a stranger has the right to purchase it an thus become the owner in fee simple, unencumbere by any claim on the part of the settler. An he is further boun to know that the absolute ownership of the soil necessarily raws along with it the right to the crop, an emblements prouce from it, whether severe or not, an all improvements on the lan. The settler having nothing beyon a mere nake possession, with no interest in the soil, if he plants what he cannot enjoy, or puts improvements on the lan an loses them, it is in both cases his own folly, an certainly he ought not to be hear to complain of harship, which he voluntarily brought on himself, an against which he might have guare by becoming the purchaser an thus merge his occupancy in a superior title. He is boun to know that the lan may be purchase by a stranger at any moment, an it may not inaptly be compare to the case of a tenant who sows a crop w'hich cannot mature before the expiration of his lease, an who loses it for the reason that it is his own folly to sow when he knows that his term must expire before harvest. 4 Kent, 109.
But even if it were true that it is onlyr.the unsevere crop that woul pass, it woul not affect this case, because it appears from the certificate of the register of the Champagnoile lan istrict offere, an which shoul have been receive in evience, that that the lan upon which the corn crop was plante by Ricks, iVvas entere by James M. Floy, one of the efenants, on the 10th ay of August, 1848, an this court taking juicial notice of the seasons an oí the general course of agriculture, know that -the crop coul not have mature at that ate so as to be serve, an consequently the severance must have been after that perio. ■An this too may be fairly inferre from the proof. It follows then in any event that on that ay Floy, becoming the owner of the lan in fee simple, by purchase from the Unite States, was entitle to the crop, an Ricks ha no right or authority to enter or interfere with the lan or crop.
The certificate of the Register of the Lan Office was competent evience. By force of statutory provisions it is sufficient title to maintain ejectment, an of course is sufficient to establish title either in the prosecution or efence of any action. Digest 454. This question was settle in McCLairen vs. Wicker, 3 Eng. 195, in favor of-the amissibility of the certificate, an that case' is well sustaine by authority. Morton vs. Reeer, 5 Miss. 356. Jackson vs. Wilcox, 1 Scam. 344. S. C. 13 Peters, 516. Bullock vs Wilson, 5 Port. 338.
The statute not requiring any authentication, it is an instru-f ment of evience which proves itself, (Cox vs. Jones, 1 Stew. 379), an the court erre in rejecting it; because the general issue was-pleae, which put in issue not only the fact of the trespass, but' also the title or right of the plaintiff. It follows that any title, whether freehol or possessory in the efenants, might be given in evience uner “not guilty,” if such title showe that the right of possession, which is. necessary to support trespass, was not in the plaintiff but the efenant. 1 Chitty Pl. 538. Also, “the efenant may,” says Juge Tucker, “uner the general issue give evience that the right of freehol is in a thir person, for this proves he ha not trespasse on the plaintiff.” 2 Tucker's Com. 190. In trespass to real property, whatever will show that the efenant i not commit a trespass on the close in question at-all, or that such close was not the plaintiffs, may be given in evience uner not guilty. 9 Bac. Abr., Trespass, (I.) An it is further sai in that book, that the general issue will be applicable if the efenant i break an enter the close, but it was not-in possession of the plaintiff, or not lawfully in his possession, as against the better title of the efenant; for as the eclaration alleges the trespass to have been committe on the close of theplaintiff, not guilty involves a enial that the efenant broke' an entere the close of the plaintiff, an is therefore a fit plea if the efenant means to conten that the plaintiff ha no possession of the close sufficient to entitle him to call it his own. 9 Bac. Abr. Trespass, (K.) 544. Stephens' Pl. 178, 179.
It will be perceive that the certificate was amissible uner this plea, because it prove that the freehol was not in the plaintiff an that he ha no right to recover in the action, or by any form of pleaing.
The efenants offere in evience an instrument of writing, execute by James M. Floy, in the presence of two subscribing witnesses, purporting to convey to Anrew J. Floy,the “univie-half” of the tract of lan mentione in the certifícate an offere to prove its execution an elivery by one of the subscribing witnesses, on a ay previous to the allege trespasses, but the court refuse to permit such proof to be mae, an exclue the instrument.
It is a proposition not to be ispute, that a ee elivere passes the title, as between parties, although it is neither acknowlege nor recore. Fitzhugh vs. Croghan, 2 J. J. Marsh, 433, 434. Turner vs. Step, 1 Wash. 319. Marshall vs. Fish, 6 Mass. 30. In Jackson vs. Post, 9 Cow. 123, it was sai by Sutherlan, J., in elivering the opinion of the court, that “as between the parties to k conveyance, the recoring of it was not necessary to give it legal force an efficacy. It iveste the grantor of all his interest in the lan, an transferre it to the grantee.”
Such a ee cannot prevail against creitors an purchasers without notice. But notice of an unrecore ee is equivalent to a recor of it, an will necessarily estroy the effect of a subsequent registere ee, because one object of the registry acts is to give notice to subsequent purchasers, an if they have such notice without registry, that is all that can be require. Jackson vs. Burgott, 10 John. 461. Our statute concerning conveyances, provies for the acknowlegment or proof, an recoring of ees, {Digest 265), but there is nothing to inicate that an unrecore ee shall be voi,but on the contrary, a clear intention is manifeste that it shoul be entirely effectual to pass the estate, as between the parties an their representatives. The position of the counsel of the appellants, that the only benefit to be erive from having a ee recore is to ispense with the necessity of proof of execution, an to give preceence over subsequent purchasers an creitor’s, is eeme to be a soun interpretation of the registry acts.
This instrument was without ate but a ee takes effect from elivery (4 Kent. 454), an the offer was to prove elivery at a ay anterior to the allege trespasses.
But on examination of this instrument, we fin that it lacks one important requisite of a ee. It oes not appear to be seale, an although this may be a clerical misprision, still we must take it as we fin it in the transcript. The vei y term “ee” implies a seale instrument. Sealing at common law was an impression on wax, or wafer, or some other tenacious substance capable of being impresse; (3 Inst. 109. 4 Kent, 452), but here that is not necessary, our statute eclaring that every instrument of writing expi-esse on the face thereof to be seale, an to which the person executing the same shall affix a scroll by way of seal, shall be eeme an ajuge to be seale. Di■gest 931. The statute is only cumulative, an the common law moe woul still be goo. But this instrument being estitute of either, coul not, in our opinion, operate to pass the legal estate. But the court shoul have allowe the proof, an if sufficient, have amitte the instrument, because there can be no oubt that it woul be competent evience uner the general issue, to at least show that the grantee ha lawful license an authority to enter on the freehol, erive from the owner, an coul not therefore be guilty of trespass any more than the legal owner of the freehol himself.
It is not conceive important to iscuss the instructions given or refuse, because we think it appears istinctly that the close mentione in the eclaration, was not the close of the plaintiff, that he neither ha the right of possession nor property, an therefore any instructions preicate upon the iea of his right to recover woul be in their nature improper. Asie from that, the first an thir instructions given for him are objectionable, because they assume the allege trespasses to have been prove, an whether they were or not, was a fact to be foun by the jury, an which the court ha no right to assume as establishe. Instructions shoul be hypothetical, an emboy in plain an succinct language, the true principles of law, applicable to the facts as evelope on trial; but not assume facts to be prove, because that is an invasion of the province of the jury. Eight instructions were aske by the efenants, two of which were given an the rest refuse. These instructions were base mainly if not entirely on the rejecte testimony, an shoul not have beep aske; but the efenants ought to have stoo on their exceptions to the rejecte testimony. A party has no right to instructions looking to or base on such testimony; because the instructions are just as abstract as if no testimony ha been offere an rejecte. If the testimony, which the court improperly exclue, ha been before the jury, the fourth, fifth an seventh instructions aske woul have fairly presente the law of the case, an the others woul have been unnecessary, an might for that reason have been refuse. To multiply instructions an put ieas in .every conceivable phase is a highly objectionable practice; because it increases the labor of the court, an has a tenency to confoun the jury, by making the impression on their mins that instea of one or two, they have many an ifficult issues to ecie.
These instructions woul necessarily put an en to the case an accor with the law; for a person having a right to enter on lan, is not liable in an action of trespass for entering even with force, Wile vs. Cantillion, I John. Cas. 123. Hyatt vs. Woo, 4 John. 150. 13 John. 236. McDougal vs. Litcher, 1 John. 44. No person can recover upon a claim of right to property against .another whose rights to the subject matter are superior to those .of the person so claiming amages for a violation of his suppose rights. If the entry is violent an with a multitue of people, it may be an offence for which the» party so entering must answer criminally, but it woul be an absui’ity to say that he must also be responsible in amages, as for an injury to a person who has no right. Per Spercer, J., in Hyatt vs. Woo, 4 John. 158.
In Tribble vs. Frame, 7 J. J. Marsh. 601, it is sai that, at the common law a person holing the title to lan an having the right of entry, might use actual force, if necessary, for overcoming any forcible resistance; because his right of entry being perfect, no other person coul lawfully resist him in the exercise of his perfect right. Now the right of entry in Floy was perfect from the 10th of August, 1848, an Ricks coul not rightfully oppose it; an the entry on the lan as actually mae by the Floys, seems to have been peaceable an orerly, an intene to secure an preserve the crop; most of which, however, was taken away by Ricks, who ha no right to it. The court shoul have grante the motion for a new trial on the groun of the improper exclusion of the evience before allue to.
This is a fit opportunity of averting to a practice which seems to have become prevalent in inferior courts, as it regars new trials. A motion for a new trial, in many instances, appears to be regare as a matter of form, an as a moe of saving the points accruing at the trial, an of putting a case in a proper attitue to be reviewe by this court. The party usually expects no benefit from it in the inferior court, an as it is mae without hope, it is enie without ue investigation. In view of the zeal of suitors, the want of time for eliberation, especially as to complicate questions, an the usual circumstances attening a trial at nisi prius, it is no imputation against the learning an ability of the respective presiing juges in those courts, to say that errors are almost unavoiable. But upon more mature eliberation they may an ought to be correcte in the tribunal where they were committe, without forcing the unsuccessful party into this court for reress. An the means of oing justice are more extene in the inferior than in this court, because, as it is the uty of the juge there, to observe an note the testimony an points uring the progress of the trial, he is presume to o so, an is through that meium cognizable of the whole case from beginning to en; the emeanor of the witnesses, an other circumstances calculate to have an influence on the verict. A motion for a new trial places the law an facts before him, unembarrasse by any question of power, an he is more likely to be able to correct injustice than an appellate court, because the latter acts only on questions of law, an cannot act on matters of fact, or isturb a verict on the mere weight of evience.

The constitution of this State vests in the Probate Courts such jurisiction in matters relative to the estates of ecease persons, executors, aministrators, an guarians, as may be prescribe by law. Const, sec. 10, Art. 6. The aministration law authorizes the clerks of Probate Courts to grant letters testamentary, an of aministration, subject however, to the confirmation or rejection of the court {Digest 110), an requires bon from the person to whom letters testamentary or of aministration are grante with two or more securities, resients of the county, to the State of Arkansas, in such sum as the court or clerk shall eem sufficient, not less than ouble the amount of the estimate value of the estate. If the bon is taken by the clerk in vacation, it is subject to the approval or rejection of the court in term time. Digest, 112, 113. An as to securities, it is ^enjoine as a uty to take persons who are solvent an sufficient, an who are not boun in too many other bons, an testimony may be taken to ascertain these facts. An an aitional bon may be require in certain cases, an on failure to give it, the letters may be revoke. Digest 116.
These provisions speak for themselves, an are too plain to Require construction or argument. They inicate the general policy of' the act to be to require security in all cases. This security is for the benefit of creitors, heirs, evisees an legatees, an there are but few instances in which it shoul be ispense with. Perhaps, in the case of a sole heir or evisee, being appointe executor or aministrator, an no ebts against atf estate, bon an security nee not be given, because waste or mismanagement of the estate woul be guare against by motives of self interest, an in any event coul injure no one but himself, an there may be other cases within a similar reason.
But the case shoul be clear, because a oubt in the scale ought to operate in favor of requiring security, that being a general requisition, which the Legislature ha the power an thought proper to make. The clerk stans in a ifferent position from the court, an has, in our opinion, no iscretion on the subject, an must therefore take bon an security in all cases. His act must pass uner the review of the court, an must be confirme or rejecte. The court has iscretion, but the clerk none, an his act is merely ministerial/’
We are not to be unerstoo as eciing that letters grante without security are absolutely voi; because we o not eem the bon a conition preceent to the valiity of the letters. We think the statute is irectory, an that the court may, in some instances, ispense with security.
But in granting, rejecting, or revoking letters, or taking, or ispensing with security, or requiring new security, the Probate Court possesses uner the law a large iscretion; which will not an shoul not be controlle by this court, unless there has been such an outrageous abuse of that as to prouce manifest injustice. The case must be a strong one to call for our interposition.
In this case we regar the action of the Probate Court as entirely proper, an within the scope of its legal authority. But if otherwise, we woul not interpose for another reason, which is, that oral testimony might be taken on these investigations; an where, as in the case here, the bill of exceptions fail to show either expressly or by necessary implication, that it contains all the testimony auce on the investigation or trial, the presumption must be in favor of the jugment.

This is an action of ebt brought upon a writing obligatory for one thousan ollars. To this action the efenant below file several special pleas in bar. To all of which the plaintiff emurre, an the court below sustaine the emurrer; the efenant reste, an jugment was given for the plaintiff below.
The first plea sets up, “that the sai writing obligatory was execute an elivere in consieration that sai Thomas H. shoul obtain, an upon the supposition that he i then an there obtain a vali title to, an become the absolute owner of a certain negro slave name Manuel; an the sai efenant avers that sai Thomas H. i not, nor i any person claiming by, through or uner him, obtain or acquire a vali title to, or become the absolute owner of sai negro, an so sai efenant says, that the consieration of an upon which sai writing obligatory was given has faile; an this he is reay to verify, &c.
Whether the “sai Thomas H. receive a vali title an become the absolute owner of sai slave Manual,” is a question of law epening upon the facts of the case. These facts ought to have been set out in the plea. It shoul have shown how the title to sai slave Emanuel was invali, an the facts which preclue the sai. Thomas H. from becoming the “absolute owner.” Pleas alleging an “invali” or efective title, an that therefore the consieration faile, must set forth the particular facts showing how the title is invali, an wherein it is efective. Dickson vs. Burk, 1 Eng. 414. The plea is eviently efective an the emurrer was properly sustaine thereto by the court below.
The secon plea is the same as-the first with the aitional allegation: “That sai Ewars on the ay of the ate of sai writing obligatory obtaine possession of sai negro an hel him until the ay of March, 1851, when sai negro kille sai Ewars, an was afterwars, to wit: on the ay of May, 1851, for that offence, pursuant to the sentence of this court, capitally punishe an execute. An sai efenant avers that sai Ewars never i acquire a vali title to or become the absolute owner of sai negro, an that sai Ewars, in his lifetime, to to wit: on the 20th ay of Nov. 1850, pai to the plaintiff the sum of one hunre an fifty ollars upon sai writing obligatory, which sum was much more than sufficient to satisfy an pay for the hire an services of sai negro after sai Ewars so obtaine possession of him an for all benefit he erive from sai purchase.”
The matters an things containe in this allegation, instea of going to show that Ewars ha no vali title, amit an show that he i have a vali title to sai negro. In October, 1850, when sai writing obligatory was execute an elivere in consieration of sai negro Manual, the sai negro was elivere to sai Ewars, the venee, at the same time, án all the right an title of Gray an wife, the venors, to sai negro Manuel, then veste in sai Ewars; an the plea oes not preten to allege that any other person, at that time, ha any right or title to sai negro. The sai negro having subsequently kille the venee, an by the State convicte of murer therefor, an sentence to eath an execute, affors no efence to this action. It oes not ivest the venee of title, or rener the title invali, or affect it any Way. The venee took the negro subject to all subsequent casualties. The plea is ba an the court below correctly sustaine the emurrer thereto.
The thir an last plea is in substance the same as the first, with the exception that it alleges, “that the plaintiffs falsely an frauulently represente to sai Ewars, that he” (Ewars) “ha acquire a vali title thereto, an become the absolute owner of sai slave Manuel,” &c., without stating what the false an frauulent representations were, an why he i not acquire a vali title an become the absolute owner. It is therefore for the same reasons fatally efective, an the emurrer was properly sustaine thereto.
The allegations in these pleas, “that Ewars i not obtain a vali title to, or become the' absolute owner of sai slave Manual,” in the absence of all facts upon which such euctions may be preicate, is pleaing a euction of law, which is in contravention to the rules of pleaing. 1 Ch. Pl. 244, 245.

Accoring to a settle octrine often heretofore applie in this court, the ecision mae when this cause was here before, is the law of the case, (5 Eng. R. 211,) an consequently nothing etermine can be now reviewe.
The evience exclue, both as to the suppose voi jugment an the process of execution thereof, an that going to show that the appellee was present at the sale of the negro in question, was properly exclue in conformity with the ecision heretofore mae in this cause, (ib. 211,) whatever oubt the court might now entertain as to either of these propositions. An even if we coul go behin that ecision, an were now to hol that the suppose estoppel coul have been as well set up in the court below on the law as upon the chancery sie thereof, the appellant coul not be consiere as having been injure by the exclusion of the latter evience, because it falls short of showing such a state of facts as woul amount to the suppose estoppel. Ha the exclue evience been amitte, all 'the evience in the entire recor tening to the point in question, so far from going to establish clearly, when consiere together, such facts an circumstances as woul have authorize the jury to presume that the purchaser was le into the purchase by reason of the presence of the real owner, aware of his rights, an by his silence or his other acts, or conuct; it conuces to show, with perhaps equal clearness, that he woul not have been eterre from the purchase by any thing that the appellee coul have sai on the occasion.
We think the instructions given were obnoxious, only to verbal criticism, if any, which coul not possibly have affecte injuriously the interest of the appellant. Certainly the suppose excessive generosity of the first instruction as to the possession of the son, by means of the possession of the father, is fully enough qualifie by the wors, “so long as they live together,” which follow, when consiere in reference to evience before the jury. An the fourth instruction, although broa enough in its terms to inclue all purchases an sales of personal property, whether mae by private or juicial sale, although exceptional in some cases that might be conceive, coul not possibly have mislea the jury in this case, where the contest is about a purchase an sale by juicial process in a cause, where the principle caveat erwptor ha been alreay ajuicate as applicable. (ib. p. 227.)
We think therefore, that there was no error either in the exclusion of the evience excepte to, nor any error, even unsubstantial, that coul have possibly affecte injuriously the appellant’s cause either in the instructions given or in those refuse. An fining the verict an jugment sustaine by the evience the jugment must be affirme.

elivere the opinion of the court.
This is a bill brought by Higgins against Henry Johnson, Robert A. Johnson, Margaret Erwin, wiow, an Henry C. Erwin, an others, heirs at law of James Erwin, ecease.
On general emurrer the bill was ajuge insufficient for want of equity. Without going into the etails of the bill with its voluminous exhibits, the substantial allegations mae by the complainant are as follows:
That in 1838 he purchase of James Erwin a certain tract of lan, in Fayette county, Kentucky, for which he pai Erwin twelve thousan ollars : that Erwin execute his ee in fee, with covenants of seizin an general warranty for the same to the complainant, who entere into possession, mae improvements, an continue in possession until 1852, when he was evicte of one half of it by paramount title, an until about that time, he never suspecte any efect in Erwin’s title, who, when he sol to the complainant, was repute to be wealthy.
That in truth the lan belonge to the first wife of James Erwin, Anne B., to whom it ha been conveye by her father; so that James Erwin ha only a life estate, as tenant by the courtesy. That Anne B. ie leaving four heirs, Henry C., Lucretia, Eugene, an Ewin, who are living an are mae efenants to the bill; that the secon wife of James Erwin is Margaret, aughter of Henry an sister of Robert A. Johnson, also efenants. That in 1847 James Erwin was the owner of a large quantity oí lans situate in Phillips an other counties in Arkansas, an being then hopelessly insolvent, for the purpose of covering up these lans from the claims of his creitors, an securing the benefit of them to himself an family, he conveye them to Henry Johnson, who, soon afterwars, conveye them to Henry C. Erwin, who.execute a general power of attorney to James Erwin, uner which the latter, uring his lifetime, continue to control an ispose of them as if they were his own.
That all these successive conveyances were frauulent an colorable, mae without any consieration pai or expecte to be pai, with intent to hiner an efeat the claims of the creitors of James Erwin, an upon the secrét trust, that they shoul be hel for the benefit of his family, an that Henry C. Erwin is no w liable to be charge in equity, as trustee of the legal title to the lans for the benefit of the creitors of James Erwin. That in 1851, James Erwin, then repute to be without property of any escription, ie wholly insolvent an intestate, an no aministration has been ha of his estate. That he left several minor chilren, of his secon marriage, also mae efenants, an that none of the chilren an heirs at law of James Erwin have succeee to any property or estate by inheritance from their father. That in 1852, after the eath of James Erwin, Henry C. an Lucretia, two of his chilren by his first marriage, relying on the title erive from their mother, institute suit in the Fayette Circuit Court against the complainant, an obtaine jugment with an orer for a writ of possession against him for an univie two-fourths of the tract of lan in question, originally conveye to him, with warranty by James Erwin; that the suppose title, so pretene to be conveye, has faile, an the complainant is in aily expectation of being evicte by Eugene an Ewin, the two remaining heirs of Anne B. Erwin.
The bill prays for iscovery, an that the allege frauulent conveyances from James Erwin to Henry, an from Henry to Bobert A. Johnson, an from him to Henry C. Erwin, may be set asie an cancelle, an the lans embrace in them subjecte to, an sol for the payment of the ebts of James Erwin, particularly that of the complainant, for the amount of which, with interest, a ecree is praye against the efenants, to be ischarge out of the procees of the lans referre to, an for general relief.
Upon the case mae by the bill, the grouns of equitable jurisiction are, that for the want of any aministration upon the estate of James Erwin, there is no legal representative against whom the complainant’s right to compensation in amages for the breach of warranty coul be establishe by an action at law; an even if there was such representative, the remey woul not be complete or aequate; because amitting tbe title of the heirs of Anne B. Erwin, to be superior to that conveye by James Erwin, so that the complainant might have been entitle in equity, before the final payment or consummation of the purchase,' to a recision, an return of the money, yet it is questionable whether, having been only partially evicte, his remey at law woul not be confine to that position only. The effect of the covenant of warranty, as now unerstoo in this country, is that for the breach of it, the grantee is entitle to be compensate in amages, equivalent to a return of the purchase money, with interest, put of the general estate of the grantor, mae subject by law for ■the payment of his ebts; an in the event of his eath, to be establishe like other claims against his estate in charge of his aministrator, an no part of which can regularly go to the heir until after all the ebts of the ancestor have been pai. An though the weight of authority is, that while a jugment of recovery uner a better title is equivalent to an eviction, without the issuance of execution, or an actual turning out of possession, the grantor coul not maintain an action for a breach of the warranty, upon the bare fear or possibility of being sue or evicte by a superior title, so that, being evicte of part, he occupies the position oí a purchaser, who has only gotten a part of the lan he bargaine for, an so woul be entitle to go into equity for a recision; an he may well unite in that suit his claim to compensation in amages for the part of which he has been evicte. Besies, on the Supposition that the property of James Erwin has improperly gone into the hans of his heirs, without being first subjecte to a ue course of aministration for the payment of his ebts, an such is the attitue in which Henry C. Erwin, the principal efenant, stans on this recor, in the suit in equity to establish the claim an subject to its payment, the property in the hans of the heir, he cannot be regare as a stranger, though professing to hol by purchase an not by escent; because in such case the heir is only liable to be sue, because he has the assets, which, for any cause, cannot be reache by a suit against the aministrator, an it may be safely sai, that as a general rule, in view of our system of aministration, where the creitor is compelle to resort to the heir for payment of the ebt of the ancestor, his remey is in chancery rather than at law.
It will not be questione that where chancery once obtains jurisiction for some substantial purpose (apart from any oubt as to mere iscovery,) it will retain it for all purposes, so as to o complete justice between all the parties; an certainly it.woul be ifficultto suppose a case, where the exercise of such a jurisicl tion woul be more beneficial than the class of cases like the present.
There is nothing in Meux vs. Anthony et al., 6 Eng. 411, that ought to conflict with the opinion here. In that case, the facts were, that Royster ha mortgage certain personal property to Anthony an Perciful, to secure ebts he owe them, an pening suits brought by them to foreclose, an while the property was out of Royster’s possession, it having been place by the orer of the court in the custoy of a receiver to prevent its being waste or remove by him pening the suits, an while Royster himself was in prison, uner a writ of ne exeat, issue in one of those suits, he execute a bill of sale of the property in controversy to Meux, expresse to be in payment of a ebt ue to him, by Royster, an Meux thereupon file his bill to arrest the foreclosure suits of Anthony, on the groun that Royster never was inebte to him, an that the mortgage was execute without consieration an with intent to efrau Royster’s creitors; The court there o not seem to have consiere the allege purchase by Meux as either fair or vali; because as the lawful purchaser, no goo reason is perceive why he might not have gone into equity to impeach an set asie any prior frauulent sale or contract respecting the same property, which was a clou upon his title to it; but the opinion of the court, on the question here involve, is preicate upon the iea that Meux was a creitor of Royster, having a claim against him of a purely legal character, which he was seeking to enforce, an obtain satisfaction of it out of the property in ispute. Wherever the remey is purely legal an aequate in a court of law, the rule is believe to be without exception, (See Brinkerhoff vs. Brown, 4 Johns. Chy. 671.) that the creitor must not only establish his claim by obtaining jugment at law, but he must pursue it to execution, an perhaps to a return of nulla bona, before he can invoke the ai of a court of equity to assail any prior conveyance to a stranger on the groun of frau, or enable him to reach any equitable estate or creits of the ebtor intangible at law. The cumulative remey by statute regulating creitor’s bills is to the same effect. In the subsequent case of Williams vs. Bizzell et al., 6 Eng. 716, where this principle was applie, the complainant, Williams, instea of exhausting his remey at law, faile to show that he was even a creitor by having pai the ebts for which he was only liable as security.
Another cause of complaint state in the bill remains to be notice. The complainant alleges that, in April 1851, he purchase of James Erwin two tracts of lan in Phillips county, of which he suppose Erwin to be the owner, but when he emane a ee, to his surprise, it was mae to him by Henry C. Erwin. That he ha pai his acceptance in favor of Henry O. Erwin for the purchase money, the raft having come to the hans of the efenant Margaret, who presente it for payment. That those two tracts were parcel of the lans inclue in the frauulent conveyances, allege to have been mae by James Erwin through Henry an Robt. A Johnson, to Henry O. Erwin. Both causes of complaint are covere by the same prayer for relief.
The fact of this money having come to the hans of Margaret Erwin, might be a circumstance in evience, tening to show the real nature of the transactions allege to be frauulent; but if'the complainant purchase these two tracts in goo faith, for aught that appears on this bill, he acquire agoo title, which is notin anger of failing.
As to this part of the bill, the ecision of the chancellor was right; but for the error in eciing that there is no equity in the bill, the ecree must, for the reasons before state, be reverse, an the cause remane for further proceeings.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of covenant, brought by Williams against Green, upon an article of agreement entere into between them on the 6th of October, 1852, for the sale of a tract of lan an improvements: the substance of the agreement, so far as necessary to be here state, being, that Williams trae an bargaine to Green a certain tract of lan, containing forty-five acres more or less, the price to be thirty ollars per acre for the lan, with the aition of the value of the improvements upon it, such valuation to be mae by two persons name in the article, an for which payment was to be mae in goos of Green, then in store, consisting of groceries, harware; &c., at the original cost, with the aition of freight on certain of the articles, an the balance of the payment for the lan to be mae in goo mules at cash valuation. The. agreement conclues as follows : “In wtness of the above trae we hereby set our hans an seals, an on forfeiture of complying with it on the part of either Green or Williams, we hereby bin ourselves, our heirs, &c., in the sum of five hunre ollars, to be well an truly pai. In testimony whereof, &c.
The eclaration, after setting out the execution of the agreement, procees to aver that Waters an Grayson, the persons name therein, value the improvements referre to, at a certain sum of money, of which the efenant ha notice, an that, on the 20th ay of the same month, Williams an wife mae an acknowlege their ee of conveyance in fee, of the lan an improvements to Green, expresse to be for the gross consieration of $1,636, with covenant of general warranty an relinquishment of ower, an tenere the same to Green, who refuse to-accept it, or to comply in any respect with the agreement on his part. Therefore, accoring to what seems to be the intention of the pleaer, though somewhat inartificially expresse, the plaintiff cl aims to recover the specifie sum of five hunre ollars agree to be pai by either party, on forfeiture of complying with the trae.
The case went off in the court below upon emurrer sustaine to the eclaration. One of the causes assigne for insufficiency, an again insiste upon here is, that the eclaration avers a tener of the ee by the plaintiff to the plaintiff. Supposing this allegation to be in any way material, the whole tenor an the immeiate context of the eclaration show it to have been a mere clerical misprision, the amenment of which, if any amenment was neee, coul occasion no surprise to the efenant; an the objection is only notice because it has been urge by counsel.
But uner the clause of general emurrer, an treating the action as being brought to recover the sum of five hunre ollars as stipulate amages, the question arises upon the construction of the instrument sue on, whether it was the intention of the parties to liquiate the amages consequent upon the failure of either party to comply with the agreement, or whether the clause quote was esigne as a mere penalty.
If there is any branch of the law, sometimes inveighe against for uncertainty, eserving of such a reproach, it is the subject we have here to consier. An though amonishe by the caution evince by other courts of the anger of attempting to lay own any general rule for cases of this escription, it seems to be necessary, in orer to explain the grouns of our ecision, to notice, albeit in a cursory an unsatisfactory manner, the principles which may affect the question to be ecie.
Anciently, at the common law, the penalty name in a bon was a security for the performance of the conition annexe to it. Upon forfeiture of the conition the obligee was entitle to recover the penalty, which was at the same time the utmost limit an beyon which the obligor’s liability coul not be extene. To obviate the harship an injustice often growing out of this stubborn rule, arose one of the early jurisictions of courts of equity, to relieve against penalties an forfeitures, by ecreeing that the jugment for the penal sum shoul stan as a security for the payment by the obligor of such amages as the obligee ha actually sustaine, of which an account woul be taken. The practical effect of .the English statute, re-enacte or tacitly aopte in this country, requiring the plaintiff suing upon a penal bon to suggest the breaches complaine of, an entering a formal jugment for the penalty, to have execution only for the amount of amages assesse, the penalty being in the meantime consiere as a security for any further breaches that might occur, was to enable courts of law to aminister the same relief before affore in chancery. There was no substantial ifference between this form of the remey an an action of covenant upon the conition an for some breach of it, isregaring the penalty; an it became reasonably apparent, that if the courts, for the protection of the obligor, looke to the actual amages sustaine by the obligee, they shoul equally isregar the penalty in favor of the obligee, where his amages for a breach of the conition expressing the real contract of the parties, happene to excee the penalty. While the law was unergoing this change in Englan, some curious illustrations may be foun in the reporte cases, of a halting between the ol an the new opinion. Sometimes the obligor was allowe to relieve himself from all further liability for amages, by paying into court the amount of the penalty; though an unsubstantial compliance with the contract, as unreal as it woul be to compel the obligee in all cases to accept such amages as might be aware to him, without the right in any case to have a specific performance. Wherever we amit that the enquiry now at law, as in equity, is, what amages the obligee has really sustaine by a breach of the conition, it woul seem to follow that, as the obligor cannot, in any case, become liable for the penalty isregaring the conition, so he can claim no protection from it. An it woul seem to be equally plain, that upon bons with a conition, an action of covenant may be maintaine for amages for a breach of the conition, whenever it contains an express or implie unertaking to o or not to o the particular act. The plaintiff in such case will recover amages commensurate with the injury he has sustaine. True, when the obligee brings ebt for the penalty, assigning breaches for the conition, he may not, owing to the technical form of the remey, be enable to recover amages to an amount exceeing the penalty; an upon official bons, an so far as the rights of securities are to be affecte, recoveries against them might not be enforce to an amount exceeing the penalty which is for their protection.
But while courts of equity affor relief against penalties, they will not relieve against liquiate amages. As penalties became unavailing, because the obligee, not entitle to or not seeking a specific performance, was require to accept a compensation in amages for such injury as he coul show he ha sustaine, a new reform of contract was resorte to, whereby the parties anticipate an agree in avance, for a certain amount of amages which woul be accepte as a full compensation for such injury as might be sustaine by a breach of the contract. Many cases may be suppose where it woul be altogether proper an expeient to allow the amages to be thus stipulate. Pruent men unerstaning their own affairs, might not be willing to run the risk of a failure of evience to prove their situation an inucements for entering into the contract, or trace the various sources from whence injury or inconvenience was expecte to result. The obligor an obligee, though for opposite reasons, might be equally unwilling to submit the question of uncertain amages to any arbitration or the precarious assessment of a jury. No court has been bol enough to eny to parties capable of contracting the right to make such contracts as they choose to enter into, in any moe authorize by law, provie they be not illegal, immoral, or against public policy.
But contracts for stipulate amages are narrowly watche, because of the facility they may affor of being use as a cover for penalties in isguise. One of the inflexible rules of law on this subject is, that whenever the sum agree to be pai, though expresse as stipulate amages, is in lieu of the non-payment of a lesser sum, certain or capable of being ascertaine from the terms of the contract, it is construe to be a penalty. Besies violating the usury laws, such a contract coul not be enforce, as stipulate amages, because it woul become a mere subterfuge an evasion of the equitable octrine of relieving against bons with a penalty, conitione for the payment of money. Germain to this is the rule, equally inflexible, that the mortgagor will not be allowe by any shift or evice; to cut himself off from the equity of reemption. Though the creitor, where a high stanar of commercial integrity prevails, may be ruine by his ebtor’s want of punctuality, the law has fixe a certain rate of interest as a compensation for the use of money. This principle istinctly state in Orr vs. Churchil, 1 Hen. Black., pervaes all the cases.
On the other han, where the amages are in their nature uncertain an ifficult of ascertainment, the amount to be pai may be stipulate by the terms of the contract; as for breach of agreement to marry a particular person. Lowe vs. Peers, 4 Burr. 2225. So of agreement not to cany on a rival trae or business, within certain limits, where the breach may consist in acts of frequent recurrence, an the amages are in some egree Conjectural. Crisee vs. Bolton, 3 Car. & Payne, 240, where Best, C. J. refuse to subscribe to the octrine attribute to L. Tentenen, in Ranall vs. Everett, 2 ib. 577, an avocate strongly the right of parties to stipulate for their amages. See also Green vs. Price, 13 Mes. & Welsby 695, S. C. 16 ib. 346. Pierce vs. Fuller, 8 Mass. 223. Nobles vs. Bates, 7 Cowen, 307. Smith vs. Smith, 4 Wen. 468. Dakin vs. Williams, 17 ib. 448. S. C. 22 ib. 201. So for emurrage or elay while work shall remain unfinishe, which is agree to be one by a certain time. Fletcher vs. Dycke, 2 T. R. 10, followe in this country by Curtis vs. Brewer, 17 Pick. 573. An a lanlor may stipulate for a particular course of husbanry, accoring to his suppose interest or caprice, an that if the tenant use the lan ifferently he shall pay an increase rate of rent. Rolfe vs. Peterson, 6 Brown's P. C. 470. So if he fail to resie on the estate. Ponsonby vs. Aams, ib. 417.
At the same time, the aversion of the law to the enforcement of penalties, has inuce the courts to lean in favor of the construction that the sum reserve shoul be hel to be a penalty in cases where, upon the whole contract, there was a oubt whether the parties intene it tobe pai as stipulate amages. We have seen that the insertion of a penalty has become of little or no practical utility, an in this State where specialty ebts have no preference over other ebts ue by simple contract, it coul harly be maintaine that a penalty ailors any security whatever: so that the reason fails, for the criterion sometimes lai own, that where the sum agree to be pai is to secure the performance of some collateral act, it will be construe as a penalty. Yet while the form of bons with a penalty continues to be kept up in public legislation, an men in their private ealings ahere to ancient forms, the mutual observance by the parties of such formality materially influences the construction to be given to the contract. There arc many cases, where on the question of intention the construction turne, to a greater or less egree, upon the aherence to the form of a penal bon with a conition, or the use of the wor penalty, or penal sum. Smith vs. Dickinson, 3 Bos. & Pul. 630. Davis vs. Renton, 6 B. & C. 216. Tayloe vs. Sanefor, 7 Wheaton 13. Perkins vs. Lyman, 11 Mass. 76. Merrill vs. Merrill, 15 ib. 488. Stearnes vs. Barrett, 1 Pick. 443. Brown vs. Bellows, 4 ib. 178. Robeson vs. Whitesies, 16 Serg. & Rawle 320. Abrams vs. Counts, 4 Ham. 214. So Buller, J., sai in Fletcher vs. Dyche, that where there is a penalty in a bon, it woul be strange for the sum mentione .in the conition to be calle a penalty. While the case of Sloman vs. Walter, 1 Brown Chy. Cases, asserts the unoubte jurisiction of courts of equity, to relieve against penalties, it might be questione if that, occurring at this ay, woul not be consiere a proper case for liquiate amages, an woul have to be uphel as a penalty upon the groun state by L. Elon, in Astley vs. Welon, (infra,) that there, by the form of the instrument, the sum appeare to be a penalty. But the inications given by the form of the contract, or the expressions use, of an intention to stipulate the amages, or to reserve a penalty merely, are not conclusive, an may be controlle by a contrary intention manifestly appearing from the tenor of the instrument, an the object the parties must have ha in view.
It woul seem to be clear that the acceptance of stipulate amages, which have been agree upon as an aequate compensation for the breach of a covenant to o or not to o any particular act, is an extinguishment of all claim to aitional amages, or for further breaches, an is an implie license to the efenant to o or not to o the act, because, if the obligee ha any right in such case, to have a specific performance, he has waive it by electing to procee for the amages. In some of the cases it appears to be taken for grante, that in orer to constitute liquiate amages, the covenantor must have the option of complying with the contract, or paying the alternative compensation agree upon. White vs Dingly, 4 Mass. 433. Glosson vs. Beale, 7 John. 72. Hasbrook vs. Tappan, 15 i. 200. Gray vs. Crosby, 18 ib. 219. Pearson vs. Williams, 24 Wen. 244. S. C. 26 ib. 630. The covenantee has the right to insist upon entire performance, or the stipulate amages in lieu of it; but where there is a part performance, or acceptance of a benefit uner the contract, the agreement for stipulate amages is broken up. As a compensation, it woul have to be apportione accoring to the extent of the performance. The cases to this effect epen upon the analogous principle, that the venee in possession cannot i:esist the payment of the purchase money, or if allowe to set up a partial failure of consieration, a proportionate share of it, because he i not get all he contracte for. Sprite vs. Taylor, 5 Metcalf 61. Ayres vs. Pease, 12 Wen. 393. Skinner vs. White, 17 Johnson, 357. Dyer vs. Dorsey, 1 Gill & John. 440. Watts vs. Shepher, [2] Ala. 425. Gower vs. Saltmarsh, 11 Missouri 271. An in Bright vs. Rowlan, 3 Howar Miss. 398, the ecision against stipulate amages was influence by the supposition that, in the event of partial performance of an entire contract, the efenant woul remain subject to pay the entire amount stipulate, an which woul then become in the nature of a penalty.
The expression of Heath, J., in Astley vs. Welon, 2 Bos. & Pnl. 346, that “where articles contain covenants for the perform anee of several things, an then one large sum is state at the en, to be pai upon breach of performance, that must be consiere as a penalty,” though often quote, furnishes a rule of very limite application to such contracts. It is emonstrate by the subsequent cases in Englan that it is no objection to an agreement for stipulate amages, where there are several acts to be one or abstaine from, because they appear to vary in importance. Unless the right of parties so to contract is enie, the only effect of such a rule woul be to require parties to be more specific in making the stipulation apply to the breach of each separate unertaking. In Kemble vs. Farren, 6 Bingham 141, the agreement provie for mutual acts to be one, of ifferent egrees of importance, some of them being the payment of small sums of money by way of salary, with a clause, “that if either of the parties shoul neglect or refuse to fulfill the sai agreement, or any part thereof, or any stipulation therein containe, such party shoul pay to the other, the sum of 1000 L., to which sum it was thereby agree that the amages sustaine by such omission, neglect or refusal shoul amount: an which sum was thereby eclare by the sai parties to be liquiate an ascertaine amages, an not as a penalty, or penal sum, or in the nature of one.” The raughtsman of this instrument certainly ha eneavore to take the istinction averte to by L. Tenteren in Davis vs. Renton, between a penalty an liquiate amages, an though it was likene to Astley vs. Welon, C. J. Tinall, put the case upon the groun, equally applicable to Astley vs. Welon, that by it a large sum of money might become payable in consequence of the non-payment of a smaller sum. So that, however clear the intention of the parties might be, as expresse, it was not allowable for them to contract in that way. The ecision in Boys vs. Ancel, 5 Bing. N. C. 390, really turne upon the same istinction, because either party might have become liable to pay the sum of 500 L., as stipulate amages, in efault of paying a trifling amount, being his part of the expense of having the papers prepare. To the same effect is Horner vs. Flintoff, 9 Mees. & Welsby 678. In Atkyns vs. Kennear, 4 Exch. 776, the efenant was boun by the covenant to o an abstain from various things, an of varying importance, for any infringement of which he was to pay the plaintiff 1000?. as liquiate amages. The breach allege was, that the efenant, contrary to the agreement, ha resie within a prescribe istance. Parke B. thought that the covenant against mere resience within the prohibite limits, woul be goo, an it was immaterial whether the plaintiff ha sustaine any amage fi-om the breach of it or not, because the non-performance imports amage; an, he with the rest of the court, wholly isregare the circumstance that, in that case, some of the covenants seeme to be of minor importance, provie the amages resulting from any breach of them woul be uncertain, an the parties ha chosen to attach consequence to a breach of them, even to the extent of 10,000?.; because, as sai by Aeerson B., “We cannot say they are wrong inasmuch as the amages are uncertain.” While this case, on the whole, concees the authority of Kemble vs. Farren, by referring it to the principle that amages cannot be stipulate for the non-payment of a lesser sum; an upon the question of intention, that where the amount stipulate for the breach of several covenants is a penalty as to any one, it is to be construe as a penalty for all, it is a istinct, an strong affirmation of the untrammelle right of parties to stipulate for amages in all cases where it is lawful to o so.
There are some cases, an it woul be strange if there were none in a epartment of the law unergoing so many'transitions, which it woul be ifficult to reconcile or approve as preceents, upon any settle principle. Thus, of the case of Perrit vs. Wallis, 2 Dallas 252, it is to be inferre that the plaintiff claime an prove actual amages to an amount exceeing the penalty an isregaring it. In Hoag vs. McGinnis, 22 Wen. 163, an Spear vs. Smith, 1 Denio 464, stipulate amages, in the event of failure to abie an awar, were hel to be penalties, partly because it seeme an innovation upon the usual course of such submission, which the parties were presume to have intene to follow an partly because the sole object of the submission was to ascertain how much was ue from either party to the other, an so liquiate the amages in that moe, an which might prove to be a less sum than the amages stipulate. In Bair vs. Tollion, 6 Humph. 186, the efenants receive of the plaintiff four five per cent. State bons, to be returne within twelve months, orpay him $4,000. On a suspicion of usury, which was not pleae, the court appear to have treate the alternative sum as a penalty, though in the absence of any proof showing that the transaction was a cover for usury, it woul be questionable if it ought to have been presume, because, whether the receipt of the four thousan ollars, in State bons, was a loan or sale of them, on time, the transaction might be a fair one, as an exchange of securities, where the plaintiff lost the interest, an the efenant ’took upon himself the risk of appreciation of the State bons.Accoring to the authority of that case there were lurking penalties in Gregory vs. Bewley, 5 Ark. 318, Hoys vs. Tuttle, 3 Eng. 125, an Bizzell vs. Blevins, ib. 138, where the substance of the contract was to pay a certain amount of Arkansas Bank notes, • by a given time, an in efault of oing so; to pay a like sum in. money, an they were hel to be unertakings in the alternative-to eliver property or pay money.
The ebatable groun is, whether parties will be allowe to1 stipulate for amages, where from the nature of the act to be one or omitte, the amages are uncertain, though not in their nature wholly uncertain or even ifficult of ascertainment or approximation; such as executory contracts for the sale or lease of realty, or to eliver chattels. The ifficulty arises out of those cases where the courts have unertaken to juge of the contract, whether the sum stipulate be reasonable or unreasonable for the parties to have agree to, an presume their intention to have been accoringly. Dennis vs. Cummins, 3 John. cases 297, Curry vs. Larer, 3 Barr. 340, Spencer vs. Tilen, 5 Cowen 144, aopte in Watts vs. Shepher, an Perkins vs. Lyman, are of that character. In Spencer vs. Tilen, although the contract was not usurious, the extraneous facts ha been brought before the-court, uner a plea of usury, an no oubt influence the ecision. In Perkins vs. Lyman it is intimate that in the construction of contracts, in orer to etermine between a penalty an liquiate amages, the court may be aie by circumstances extraneous to the writing. We apprehen there ought to be no ifference between this an any other species of contract, where the writing furnishes the rule of interpretation, subject to the explanation of latent ambiguities, or the meaning of the wors with reference to any local usage. If a efenant coul show a clear case of stipulate amages to be a penalty, he coul only o so on the principle that a party may go into equity to have a conitional sale establishe as a mortgage. When the execution of the contract is enie, or it is impeache for want of consieration, or for usury, for overreaching or frau in any of its protean shapes, all the attenant circumstances an inucements-are opene for proof, an then, any apparent inequality or gross unfairness on the face of the contract, woul ai the proof of extrinsic facts in orer to raise the presumption of frau.
The argument for the exercise of such a iscretion by the courts is, that the price agree to be pai for the property, an which also has a market value, furnishes a reay stanar accoring to which the purchaser can be compensate for the loss of his bargain. It woul be true that, where the amages stipulate to be pai to the venor excees the price agree upon for the property, it woul be voi as a compensation, an coul only stan as a penalty for the non-payment of a lesser sum. That was the case in Moore vs. Platt, 8 Missouri 467. But the case of Glosson vs. Beale, 7 John. 72, seems to go an extreme length 'the other way. There the efenant sol the plaintiff a tract of lan for $500, an agree to make him a goo title to it within a year, or in lieu thereof to pay him $800. There the contract ha been execute on the part of the plaintiff, by the payment of the purchase money, an the ecision that he was entitle to recover the $800 as liquiate amages, coul perhaps be uphel on the supposition that the venor meant to stipulate a certain amount of amages, in case the title faile, to cover improvements mae by the venee uring the year, instea of a return of the purchase money with interest, the orinary measure of a breach of warranty, an in that view it was a proper subject for stipulate amages.
The argument state coul only affect the stipulation for amages to be pai to the venor who ha agree to sell the property for its amitte value. But in Reilly vs. Jones, 1 Bing. 302. Tingley vs. Cutler, 7 Conn. 291, an Grammon vs. Howe, 14 Maine 250, upon agreements to lease or sell, the actions were brought by the party unertaking to lease or sell, an stipulate, amages recovere for failure to pay the purchase money, an without any enquiry whether the sum stipulate bore a reasonable proportion to the value of the property, although in stipulating the amages, the parties ha provie a moe for the cancellation of the agreement, an the plaintiff woul not only recover the amages, but keep his property. That the purchaser may recover stipulate amages for the non-compliance of the party unertaking to sell or lease, is well establishe. Knapp vs. Maltby, 13 Wen. 587. Chamberlain vs. Bagley, 11 N. Hamp. 234. Brewer vs. Egerly, 13 ib. 275. Mea vs. Wheeler, ib. 351. Hasbrook vs. Tappan, before cite. Jenkins vs. Yates, 2 J. J. Marsh. 49. Hamilton vs. Overton, 6 Black. 206.
An there is no goo reason why the like rule shoul not apply to agreements for the sale or elivery of chattels of any particular escription by a ay certain! If for example, the contractor to buil a ship may subject himself to the payment of stipulate amages, by way of emurrage, for failing to have it complete by the time specifie, he ought to have the power to stipulate in like manner with those who may unertake to furnish the materials, that are to enter into its construction.
Our impression is, that wherever the act to be one or abstaine from, is other than the payment of money, the circumstance that the actual amages may be more or less easily susceptible of ascertainment, ought not to influence the construction of an •agreement to be one way .or the other, a stipulation for amages or merely by way of penalty, Where the amages are at all uncertain or unliquiate, the parties ought to be allowe to anticipate an stipulate them if they choose to o so. Whenever courts attempt to take a istinction among contracts of this class, where no uniform or intelligible rule can be lai own to govern the istinction, they not only assume a most vexatious jurisiction to reform the contracts of weak or sanguine men, but it tens to impair the confience which all men ought to have in the obligation of contracts.
The strong esire of mankin to be permitte to act as free agents rebelle against the course of ecision which isarme a penalty of its terror, an as it cease to affor a security for the performance of a contract, they resorte to agreements for stipulate amages, which uner the iea of a compensation, grew up •to be recognize as legitimate. The truth is, the real object of every stipulation for consequential amages, is to secure the performance of the contract itself, an but for the confusion of terms, it woul be proper to say, that covenants to pay a certain amount of amages for the breach of any unertaking have, to the extent that they are allowable, taken the place of penalties; the only broa istinction being, an which prevails in chancery as .at law, between penalties or forfeitures for the non-payment of money, an those which are incurre by the failure to perform any other collateral act.
Upon the case presente by the recor here for ajuication, our conclusion, but with some hesitation, is, that accoring to any fair construction of the instrument sue upon, an in view of the rules of interpretation furnishe by the ecisions to which we have averte, the plaintiff is entitle to recover the sum of five hunre ollars as stipulate amages. The wor “forfeiture,” in the connection where it is use, obviously means a failure to comply with the agreement. It is true the parties have not use the term, stipulate or liquiate amages, expressive of a clear intention to negative the iea of a penalty; but on the other han, the instrument hasnottheform of apenalbon, where the sum specifie woul excee, being usually ouble the amount or value of the subject to which the contract relate; an on the whole, we think these parties intene that the sum of five hunre ollars was to be pai by either party to the other, as an agree compensation for such amages as woul result from a refusal to comply with the trae. The price of the lan was not to be pai in money, but in merchanize, some of it at the original cost, an in mules at a cash valuation. The plaintiif coul not be expecte to show by evience what profits he might have mae by the resale of the goos an the mules, or what other losses he may have sustaine by so entire a isappointment in his contemplate arrangements. The series of acts to be one by either party, mae up but one entire whole, which was the consumnjation of the trae. If at liberty to o so, we coul not unertake to say that the sum here specifie is unreasonable or isproportionate to the value of the property which, by the terms of the contract, was to be exchange.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of covenant brought by Jennings & Co., against Haleman, to recover the sum of five hunre ollars, as stipulate amages for breach of a contract entere into between them. The efenant making efault, the court on motion of the plaintiff, upon inspection of the instrument, an without any other testimony being auce, proceee to give jugment for the sum specifie as liquiate amages, against the objection of the efenant, who claime that a jury shoul be calle to enquire an assess the actua.1 amages the plaintiffs ha sustaine by the breach, which stoo amitte.
By the terms of the agreement, entere into on the 28th of October, 1845, Haleman unertook to manufacture an eliver to Jennings & Co., in New Orleans, on or before the 1st ay of July 1846, five thousan staves, an after a minute specification of their size, quality, &c.,the agreement procees as follows; “An the sai Jennings & Co., in consieration, &c., covenant to an with the sai Peter Haleman, that they will from time to time make such avances in goos an money to him as may appear to them proper an reasonable, as the work may progress, an for all such avances, the sai Jennings & Co. shall euct the amount or amounts thereof, out of the price tobe pai to sai Haleman, after the elivery of sai staves as hereinafter mentione. The sai Jennings & Co., after the shipment an elivery at New Orleans of the before mentione quantity of five thousan staves, shall allow to the sai Haleman, as their value, eighty ollars per thousan, first eucting the amount of sai avances, an the balance over an above such avances shall be pai to sai Haleman by sai Jennings & Co.
“An the sai Haleman an Jennings & Co., covenant to an with each other, that each one will in goo faith perform his part of the foregoing stipulations, an that a failure to perform all or any part of them, shall subject the failing party to pay the other the sum of $500 as stipulate amages, without abatement or iminution.”
We may suppose, that the language use by these parties, manifests a very clear intention to make it a case of ascertaine an stipulate amages, an that they mutually intene it to be so. If the stipulation ha been confine to the breach of the agreement on the part of Haleman, we coul have no oubt that the amages which might be sustaine by Jennings & Co., in such event, woul be of that uncertain character, which woul make it effectual an bining on him. The court woul have to presume that while there were sufficient inucements for Haleman to enter into the agreement, Jennings & Co. on the other han may have ha engagements outstaning epenant upon this, making it important to them that there shoul be a faithful an punctual compliance on the part of Haleman. The stipulation woul cover those remote an consequential amages which the plaintiffs might have sustaine by the failure of the efenant, an as they might excee the sum stipulate, he woul have no right to complain in the face of his own' agreement, if they happene to be less.
But the apparent fairness of the agreement in making the stipulation mutual, has estroye its efficacy as a contract for stipulate amages, an the law presumes against the intention of the parties however clearly expresse. The stipulation might well have been mutual if the act to be one by Jennings & Co. consiste in something other than the payment of money, an perhaps even in such case, if the sum stipulate for afailure on their part bore some fair an reasonable proportion to the gross consieration they were to have pai for the staves. We fin that Jennings & Co. unertook to make avances as the work of getting out the staves progresse. Our impression is that in every case of stipulate amages, the party, who may become entitle to them, has the right to insist upon a punctual an literal compliance with the contract, or in lieu of it to have the amages agree upon: but in every such case the voluntary acceptance of a partial performance, woul be a waiver of the right, stricti juris, to recover the entire amages as for an entire breach. The contract here contemplate that there shoul be partial a - vanees, to be a euction from the price of the staves on elivery, an although the avances were to be mae accoring to the iscretion of Jennings & Co., as they might think proper an reasonable, it coul harly be intene that they ha an arbitrary iscretion to refuse to make any avances. If therefore, on the reasonable request of Haleman, Jennings & Co. ha refuse to make any small avance, the contract woul have been at an en, an they woul become at once liable to pay him the entire sum of $500 without any obligation on his part to procee any further in the way of performance.
But waiving that consieration, however important it may be-in etermining the real intention of the parties to be ifferent from what they have expresse, it appears that the gross price to be pai for the staves on elivery amounte to $400, their amitte value, an all that Haleman expecte to get for them. Laying asie all circumlocution, the effect then, of the stipulation was: that if Jennings & Co. faile to pay Haleman the-sum of four hunre ollars, they shoul at once become liable to pay five hunre ollars. Now, the recovery of the four hunre ollars at the en of a law suit, though with the allowance of interest for its etention, might be a very inaequate compensation to Haleman as compare with the prompt payment by Jennings & Co. of the contract price: but accoring to our unerstaning of the authorities, averte to in the case of Williams vs. Green, ecie at this term an where this subject is much-consiere, the rule is inflexible, that where a sum of money is stipulate to be pai in the event of failure to pay a smaller sum. it must be treate as a penalty.
It results from the shape of the stipulation in this case, that being mutual an inivisible in its terms, it cannot be construe as a penalty in favor of one party, an, at the same time, be stipulate amages as against the other. The jugment of the court below must therefore b.e reverse an the cause remane with instructions to take an enquiry of the amages which the plaintiff may have sustaine by the breach of contract on the part of Haleman. The ifference, if any, in their favor, between the; price they were to have pai Ilaleman, an what they coul have realize for the staves in the New Orleans market, at the time they ought to have been elivere accoring to contract, woul be a legitimate subject of enquiry. Without any proof, the plaintiff will only be entitle to recover nominal amages-",legal_case

Conceing every fact in favor of the enorsee, which the evience conuce to prove, it woul appear that on the 26th of February he presente the note to the maker an emane payment of it, which was refuse, of which, on the same ay he notifie the enorser in person, an that he looke to him for payment. The two in company then calle upon the maker, who mae a partial payment on the note to the enorsee, who now seeks to recover of the enorser the resiue remaining unpai.
Various points are argue upon the instructions given an refuse in the court below, only one of which is material to be consiere, as upon that, the jugment in favor of the enorser will have to be affirme.
Accoring to the existing law of this State, the enorsee or assignee of this note ha choice of two courses to pursue. If he esigne to charge the enorser, as of commercial paper, accoring to the law merchant, he was boun to make presentment an eman of payment from the maker, an give notice of non-payment to the enorser, accoring to the rules of the law merchant. Or neglecting that course, he might, after prosecuting with ue iligence a fruitless suit against the maker, have ha recourse against his assignor, accoring to the law concerning assignments, as heretofore unerstoo an practice in this State.
In Jones vs. Robinson, 6 Eng. 504, it was recognize an settle in this court, that accoring to the law merchant the enorsement of a note past ue, was equivalent to the rawing of a new bill by the enorser upon the maker in favor of the enorsee, payable on eman. That, in orer to charge the enorser in such .case, payment must be emane of the maker within a reasonable time after the enorsement, an ue notice of his refusal .given to the enorser. An that what woul be a reasonable time, though epening to some extent on the situation of the parties, an the circumstances of each case, is always a question of law for the court, accoring as the facts might be proven or amitte.
Our opinion is that if the rights an liabilities of parties to negotiable paper are sought to be ascertaine an fixe accoring to the law merchant, new to some extent, an not generally practice in this State, its rules, so far as applicable to our system of law, ought, for the best interests of all whom they may concern, to be aopte, as they are unerstoo accoring to the most approve authorities an steaily ahere tol
In this case the enorsement having the effect of a bill payable on eman, no ays of grace were allowe. As the parties all resie in the same town where the enorsements were mae, the enorsee was boun to make presentment an eman payment of the maker, in person, or at his usual place of business, or at his resience, on the ay of the enorsement, or on the ay following, an to give notice of non-payment to the enorser on the ay of the presentment, or on the next succeeing ay. The temporary absence of the maker i not excuse presentment at his place of business or aboe. As the unertaking of the enorser was conitional that he woul pay if the maker i not, upon presentment in ue season, an upon his being uly notifie of the maker’s efault, it evolve on the enorsee to prove that he ha use the iligence require of him, or such facts, if they existe, as woul by law ispense with it.
Without unertaking to lay own any rule of universal application, as to what constitutes reasonable iligence, it suffices here to say that the elay of the holer for 25 ays, without any attempt to make presentment, or give notice of non-payment, where the parties resie in the same place, amounte to such negligence as woul ischarge the enorser.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
At the October term, 1852, of the county court of Pulaski county, certain proceeings, to which Couch was a party, touching a public roa, were finally ecie aversely to him. He took a bill of exceptions, file an affiavit, an praye an appeal to the Circuit Court, which the County Court grante. On the 6th of December following, a certifie transcript of the proceeings was file in the Circuit Court, an on the 20th of January, 185#; on motion of the attorney general, Couch being present an resisting, the Circuit Court ismisse the suppose cause, to which Couch, by his attorney, excepte, an sue out a writ of error to this court.
There was really no cause in the Circuit Court to ismiss. The prayer for an appeal,, an the action of the County Court upon it ha no legal effect to transfer the cause to the Circuit Court: nor i the filing of the transcript there, on the part of Couch, have any such effect. Not that the Circuit Court ha no appellate jurisiction of such a cause, but because no steps ha been taken to invoke that jurisiction. Such steps can be taken in the Circuit Court only in the absence of statutory regulations, touching such cases, of which we have none, beyon the act of the 21st December, 1846, (Dig. p. 313, sec. 12), investing the Circuit Court with intermeiate appellate power, but making no regulations for its exercise.
Until the Legislature shall think proper to make such regulations, the Circuit Courts, at the instance of parties, must use their common law an other means known to the law, to give effect to these intermeiate appellate powers thus investe in them as (Carnall vs. Crawfor county, 6 Eng. R. at p. 613), to matters properly cognizable in the County Courts, an not provie for by the act of the 4th January, 1849, (Pamph. Act p. 59). The case of Carnall vs. Crawfor county, was within the provisions of this latter act an was brought into the Circuit Court in accorance with its regulations, an it was hel that in such ca.ses the Legislature contemplate a qualifie trial e novo in the Circuit Court, as provie for appeals from the Probate Court. Cases like this at bar, however, being unprovie for by statute, remain, as at common law, an are subject to be quashe or affirme only in the Circuit Court, as the case may be. The process in the Circuit Court performing the functions of a writ of error, (ib. at p. 614).
Neither the constitution nor any statute of this State invests the county court with exclusive j urisiction in matters of public roas, close to superior review; on the contrary these courts are oubly open to the primary review of the Circuit Courts clothe, as they are, with constitutional power of superintening an statutory power of intermeiate appeal. Doubtless, therefore, when the party in this case shall properly present his case in the Circuit Court, he will be entitle to have it hear an have the oings in the County Court either quashe or affirme.
Fining no error in the action of the Circuit Court, its oings in this case must be affirme.

1862731,Lovette and Wife vs. Longmire,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker
elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was a bill in chancery, file by Lovette an wife, to enjoin the sale of certain slaves taken in execution to satisfy a jugment obtaine by Longmire against Lovette. The slaves are claime by the wife as her separate property, uner the provisions of the Statute, Digest, chapter 104, which, in certain cases exempts slaves an other property owne by the wife at the time of her marriage, or which comes to her uring coverture, from sale, for the payment of the husban’s ebts.
It appears from the facts isclose that on the 13th of May, 1846, Longmire obtaine jugment in the Union Circuit Court, against Lovette, in ebt for $522 50, besies interest an costs. On the first ay of December, 1847, the slaves taken in execution came to the possession of Lovette an wife by inheritance, from Elizabeth Jamieson, the mother of Mrs. Lovette. On the 7th of November, 1848, uner the provisions of the 7th section of the act approve December 8th, 1846, above referre to, a scheule of the property so inherite, incluing the slaves levie upon, was file in the Recorer’s office, of the county of Union, it being the county in which Lovette an wife live an hel the property. On the 22 of March, 1850, the slaves were taken in execution,, to enjoin the sale ‘of which this suit was brought.
There is no oubt but that the slaves were inherite by the wife, an- hel by her uner the provisions of the act of 1846, uner a substantial compliance with the provisions of that statute. u
But the question is, whether the statute exempts them from, liability for the payment of this ebt, which was contracte before the estate veste in Mrs. Lovette, an before the scheule-was file in the Recorer’s office.
The first section of the act permits the wife to hol property,, real or personal, by bequest, evise, gift or istribution in her own right an for her own use, except such as may come from the husban after coverture. The secon section continues the title of slaves in the wife which she hel at the time of her marriage, notwithstaning her coverture, an allows her to hol an possess the same as her separate property, exempt from any liability for the ebts or contracts of the husban. The thir section confers a like right to property thus acquire before the passage of the act from the payment of ebts contracte after its passage. The 9th section provies that “before any marrie woman can avail herself of the privileges an benefits of this act she an her husban shall make out a scheule of the property erive through her, uner oath, which shall be verifie by the oath of some other reputable person, which scheule shall be file in the Recorer’s office, of the county within which the property is, as well as in which they live.” An then the 8th an last section provies that “the operation of this act shall not interfere with the collection of ebts alreay contracte by any marrie man, or which shall hereafter be contracte before the filing of the scheule referre to in the preceing section.” These are the material provisions of the statute, an although the secon section provies in general terms, that the wife shall hol such property exempt from any liability for the payment of the ebts or contracts of the husban, still the 8th an last section in express terms, eclares that this act shall not interfere with the collection of ebts alreay contracte by a marrie man, or which shall afterwars be contracte before the scheule provie for in the 7th section shall have been file, which filing is a pre-requisite to the enjoyment of the benefits of the act. In the case uner consieration tbe ebt was not only contracte before the passage of the act, an consequently the filing of the scheule uner it, but also before the inheritance escene to the wife, an therefore comes irectly within the provisions of the 8th section, unless we coul, as contene for by the appellants, construe this section so as to make it apply to contracts entere into upon the faith an creit of this property whilst in the joint possession of the husban an wife, an before the scheule ha been file, as require by the provisions of the 7th section. But the 6th an 8th sections were eviently intene as limitations upon the general terms of the secon section, particularly the 8th, which is clear an explicit in its terms, an is esigne to limit the operation of the preceing sections. There is nothing ambiguous or oubtful in the language use, an when such is the case there is no room for construction ifferent from the plain language use. It follows, therefore, from the conclusions at which we have arrive, that the slaves, although no oubt exempt from the payment of ebts contracte by the husban after the scheule of the slaves ha been file in the Recorer’s office, were nevertheless liable to the payment of this, it being a ebt contracte before the passage of the act of 1846, uner which the wife claims protection for the property.
Inepenant of this fatal objection to the relief praye for by the complainants, their bill was upon its face emurrable. Amit the slaves to have been theseparate property of complainant, (the wife), that they were family slaves, value on account of long an faithful servitue, above all reasonable compensation in amages, an that one of them was inhumanly separate from her infant chil, still the sale of them by the sheriff woul not eprive Mrs. Lovette of a full an aequate reress at law against the purchaser for possession of the slaves. It is not allege that by reason of the sale they woul be place beyon the reach of process at law, an as the question of the sufficiency of the bill to entitle the complainant to equitable relief, was specially re^ serve in the efenant’s answer; upon that groun, as well as the first, that the slaves were subject to the payment of Long-mire’s ebt, the court below shoul have ecree against the complainants.
As a matter of practice, the ecree of the Circuit Court shoul have been simply to issolve the injunction an ismiss the complainant’s bill, leaving the sheriff to execute his common law process of sale. Beyon this, from the state of the pleaings, the Cir j cuit Court ha no power to ecree relief. The ecree of the Union Circuit Court, so far as regars the issolution of the injunction an the ismissal of the complainant’s bill was certainly correct. But so far as regars the specific relief ecree, it was clearly erroneous an must, for that error, be set asie an reverse with costs; an a ecree renere in this court in accorance with the opinion herein elivere.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The efenant was inicte in the Yan Burén Circuit Court for an assault an battery, allege to have been committe on the person of one William York. At the foot of the inictment there ■is the following enorsement: “ This inictment is preferre upon the testimony of the party injure, who was summone on presentation an by orer of the gran jury.
JOHN H. BYERS, Pro. Atto.”
The question is, was this enorsement sufficient uner the 87th sec. Dig. ch. 52. That section provies that “ No inictment for any trespass on the person or property of another, not amounting to felony, shall be preferre, unless the name of the prosequtor be enorse thereon, except where the same is preferre on the information or knowlege of one or more of the gran jury, or on the information of some public officer in the necessary ischarge of his uty, or on the' testimony of some witness other than the party injure, in which case a statement of the fact shall be mae at the en of the inictment an signe by the attorney for the State.”
The enorsement in this case falls short of a compliance with the statute. The fact that the witness was summone to testify, was not sufficient to supersee the necessity of his enorsement as prosecutor. If the party assaulte was permitte thus to evae the statute, he woul rarely incur the responsibility of paying the costs of the prosecution, in the event of an acquittal, by enorsing himself as prosecutor, when by procuring himself to be summone, he coul by his testimony put on foot a prosecution intene to gratify his private resentment without incurring such responsibility.
It may sometimes be the case that the party injure is the only witness by whom the offence can be proven, an that, because of his refusal to become prosecutor, the offener may go unpunishe; but we apprehen that cases of this kin will be rare. The language of the enorsement is somewhat peculiar; it is that “the inictment is foun on .the testimony of the party injure, who was summone upon presentation, an by orer of the gran jury.” This language strongly implies that the gran jury were informe, or ha knowlege of the fact, an upon such information summone the witness. If such was the fact an their information was sufficient to satisfy them, that an inictment shoulabe preferre, the enorsement woul have been sufficient, if it ha simply state the fact that it was foun upon the information of one or more of the gran jurors. But in the case before us, it is expressly state that the inictment is foun upon the testimony of the party injure, an the resiue of the enorsement is intene to show how an uner what circumstances he was brought before the gran jury. The enorsement was clearly insufficient, an the motion to quash properly sustaine.

1862681,Cockrell vs. Warner,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Hempstea, Special Juge,
elivere the opinion of the Court. . On the 29th of April, 1847, Franklin S. ""Warner file his bill of complaint against John Cockrell, alleging in substance, that on the 27th of December 1845, the latter purchase from him a large stock of cattle an hogs, an for which he execute to him the following instrument of writing : “ On or before the first ay of January, 1847, I promise to pay to F. S. Warner, or bearer, thirty-eight bales of cotton, weighing five hunre pouns each, an an average of my crop mae on Long Prairie, with ten per cent interest after maturity, for value receive. December 27th, 1845. John Cockrell;” that although Cockrell raise, gathere an baile, on his plantation in Long Prairie, cotton exceeing thirty-eight bales of the above mentione weight, which ha been emane after the contract mature : yet that he absolutely refuse to eliver the cotton or comply with the agreement, an in violation of it shippe nearly all, if not all his cotton to New Orleans, an place it beyon the reach of Warner, that Cockrell live in Louisiana, where the bulk of his estate was situate, an which was uner paramount liens an incumbrances, that woul rener any attempt to enforce the agreement in that State fruitless, even if jugment shoul be obtaine; that he then ha personal property in Lafayette county, Arkansas, consisting of negroes, cattle an hogs, sufficient to satisfy the eman, but owne no real estate; that he esigne removing all his property from Arkansas into Louisiana, as soon as he coul o so,conveniently, an before Warner coul possibly recover amages for the infraction of the agreement, by means of the orinary forms of law; that Cockrell, acknowleging the justice of the eman, refuse to ajust or pay the same, an intene, before jugment coul be obtaine, frauulently to place his property beyon the reach of legal process, an thus efeat the eman, an that from the best information Warner coul obtain as to the value of cotton on the 1st of January, 1847, his eman against Cockrell then amounte to 2,337 ollars.
The bill praye that Cockrell might be compelle to perform the agreement specifically, by elivering the thirty-eight- bales of cotton accoring to the agreement, or make satisfaction for its-non-performance; that an injunction be issue to prevent the removal of his property, an for general relief. The bill was verifie by the affiavit of the complainant; an injunction bon given, an a writ of injunction issue accoring to the prayer of the bill.
Cockrell answere, amitting the purchase of cattle an hogs, but enie recollecting that he gave Warner his obligation for thirty-eight bales of cotton, as allege in the bill, an state that he gave an obligation for about 1100 ollars an no more; that he gave 1,000 ollars for the cattle an 100 ollars for the hogs; he amitte that he ha more than 38 bales of cotton on his plantation, but enie that Warner emane the cotton, or any thing else, in ischarge of the obligation, an averre that after its maturity, Warner gave him his own time to pay it in; he amitte that he ha shippe the cotton, as allege in the bill, as he insiste he ha a right to o; he amitte he resie in Louisiana, that some of his property there was uner mortgage; but that he ha a large amount of property wholly unencumbere, sufficient to pay at least 50,000 ollars, which, at the filing of the bill was subject to execution; he amitte his esign of removing-his property from Arkansas to Louisiana, where he resie, but not before January, 1849; enie any intention of avoiing the payment of the sum really ue, or of efrauing Warner out of the ebt, an enie generally the frauulent esigns an purposes impute to him in the bill. The answer was verifie by the affiavit of Cockrell, an he mae it a cross bill against Warner, propouning interrogatories to be answere, an charging that Warner represente that he ha at least 270 hea of cattle, an they woul probably excee 300, an that he ha exceeing 100 hogs, an confiing in this representation he, Cockrell, mae the purchase, but that upon collecting them he foun that Warner ba only about 130 hea of cattle, an 70 hea of hogs; he averre that he ha no recollection of giving any such obligation as that allege in the bill, an mae other statements an charges, not material to be notice; he praye that Warner might be compelle to fully an irectly answer the charges an eclarations in his answer, as well as the special interrogatories propoune, ■an that an account be ha an taken between them, an that Cockrell shoul be allowe creit for the eficiency in the cattle an hogs, an for general relief. Warner answere the cross bill, enying its charges an allegations, an the impute misrepresentation, an in response to the interrogatories, set out the circumstances of the contract, an its breach; that Cockrell really obtaine a greater number of cattle an hogs than Warner represente he ha, that Cockrell ha frequently expresse himself perfectly satisfie with his bargain, an that he well knew that the obligation he ha execute was for thirty-eight bales of cotton, an not for money at all; that he was not entitle to any euction or abatement; that Warner ha emane the cotton ■an require compliance with the agreement, on the part of Cockrell, an ha not extene the time of payment, as allege. This answer was verifie by the affiavit of Warner. On the :8th of November, 1848, Warner file his supplemental bill, setting out all the previous pleaings an proceeings, an stating as new matter, that since the last term of the court he ha receive information confirmatory of the charge in the original bill, as to the removal of the property of Cockrell from Arkansas, an ■that Warner woul lose his eman unless the same shoul be prevente. A fresh injunction was grante, an several slaves belonging to Cockrell seize by the sheriff, but restore to him ■on bon an security, to abie the ecree of the court, an pay any sum that might be ecree against him in the case. A subpoena in chancery was issue on the supplemental bill, an execute on Cockrell personally, the 22 of November, 1848; but he faile to answer.
The cause was finally hear on bills, answers, cross bill, answer, replications, an evience taken, an the court ecree in favor of Warner, to the amount of 2,913 ollars an 33 cents, with ten per cent, interest thereon, from the 3 of May, 1852, until pai, with costs, from which ecree Cockrell appeale to this court.
The pleaings in the case, are carelessly prepare, an spun out to an unnecessary length, which may, in part, account for the negligent manner with which the proceeings have been conucte. Enough appears however to enable the court to ecie the case on the merits, conclusively between the parties, which is e-* sirable in all instances where it is practicable, without oing ipjustice.
Probably most, if not all the property thus purchase, was, running at large, an so not actually elivere. But by the contract Warner parte with his title an ownership, an Cockrell; acquire them, an from that time exercise control over the property, an appropriate it to his own use at pleasure. The general property, by the sale, veste in Cockrell, an that rew to it the possession.
From the proof it is not entirely clear as to the number Cockrell actually secure, but the preponerance of evience is, that Warner ha between 270 an 300 hea of cattle, an 100 hea of hogs, not estimating a few pork hogs reserve, an as Cockrell frequently expresse himself satisfie with his bargain, it is a fair inference that he secure the whole, or so near it, as to rener the ifference trifling an unimportant. The number secure by Cockrell however, woul be no evience of the number-purchase by him, because he might not have been vigilant ip securing or taking them, or use but little if any care in the bun siness, or performe it in an improper manner. This coul not be the criterion. But were it otherwise, the result woul be the same, because it is in proof that Cockrell was acquainte with the number an quality of the cattle an hogs, an it cannot be seriously questione, but that he took upon himself the entire risk of obtaining the fruits of his purchase. If he was negligent or inattentive to them, suffere them to go wil for want of proper care, or coul pot, or i not collect them all, the loss was his own an he coul claim nothing by way of recoupment at the hans of Warner. The stock was at large — in the range, an it is manifest from the circumstances, that it was what is frequently calle a “chancing bargain,” without warranty, an which, in the absence of frau or misrepresentation, coul not entitle the venor to aitional compensation for excess, nor the venee to any abatement for eficiency. In point of fact however, we are not incline to believe it was a losing bargain on the part of Cockrell.
Although that seems to have been the prominent iea of the pleaer, this was not a proper case for a specific performance, notwithstaning a bill for that purpose may be maintaine in many cases of personal chattels, where there coul be no aequate compensation in amages at law. 2 Story’s Eq. 708. 3 Atk. 384. Aerly vs. Dixon, 1 Sim. & Stu. 607. Woo vs. Rowcliffe, 3 Hare. 304.
If, however, a man contracts for the purchase of a hunre bales of cotton, or boxes of sugar, or bags oí coffee, of a particular escription or quality, or commoities of a like kin, if the contract is not specifically performe, he may generally, with a sum equal to the market price, purchase other commoities of the same kin, escription, an quality, an thus attain his object an inemnify himself against loss. 2 Story's Eq. 746.
This case falls within that principle, an the authorities against-treating it as a question of specific performance are conclusive..
The obligation signe by Cockrell was not of that class payable in money, but ischargeable in property. It was a strict property note, payable in cotton generally, at a specifie time, an no eman on the part of Warner was necessary to fix the liability of Cockrell. By its terms the latter assume upon himself the uty of ischarging it in cotton, an a failure to comply entitle the former to recover the value of the commoity on the 1st January, 1847, when it mature. On the proof the court fixe the market value at ten cents, an might, with propriety have given as high as eleven cents per poun, on the principle that, where a party has it in his power to ischarge himself from liability by the elivery of property, an fails without a sufficient excuse, the amages shoul be measure by the highest market value of the property at the time when it shoul have been elivere, 1 Strange, 505. 3 Cowen, 83. Segwick on Damages, 497. On this groun then, Cockrell has no right to complain. The ecree is certainly warrante by the pleaings an evience, an without specially noticing the items of recoupment claime by Cockrell, it is sufficient 1o observe that he has suffere no injury, of which he can complain, since if every one of them ha been allowe, the ecree might still be for the amount for which it was renere. ""
The principal question, however, mae by the appellant in this court is, that the case shoul have been ismisse .at the hearing on his motion, for want of jurisiction, on .the groun that there was an aequate remey at law, an because .a court of chancery coul not ecree amages for a breach of contract.
The objection as to jurisiction was not mae or reserve by the pleaings, an certainly comes with an ill grace from one who, for years, has been engage in unsuccessful resistance of .an honest an just eman. If there was a clear, aequate an unembarrasse remey at law, he shoul in all fairness, have brought forwar an relie on that efence, either by plea, emurrer or answer, an to surprise his aversary with it at the hearing woul appear like, if it oes not in fact constitute an abuse of justice. It is oppose to that fair ealing, which courts of equity eman at the hans of its suitors. After taking all the chances of a protracte litigation, contesting a cause on the merits, an being at last efeate, to allow him to bring forwar that preliminary objection at the hearing bears too close an analogy to taking avantage of one’s own wrong to be encourage, Lulow vs. Simon, 2 Caines Cas. Er. 40 & 56; Unerhill vs. Van Cortlant, 2 Johns. Ch. R. 369. Still if the law gives a suitor thus circumstance that avantage, he must have it without stint, because its.rules are inflexible, an its benefits, like the rains of heaven, share by the just an the unjust alike.
Now it is a general rule, that where aefenantby his answer, has put himself on the merits, an not reserve any objection to the jurisiction of the court, on the groun that there is an aequate remey at law, he cannot insist on it at the hearing, unless the court is wholly incompetent to grant the relief sought by the bill; as where there woul be no cognizance over the subject matter. Hawley vs. Cramer, 4 Cow. 717. Delafiel vs. State of Illinois, 2 Hill, 159. Granin vs. Le Roy, 2 Paige, 519. Livingston vs. Livingston, 4 Johns. Ch. R. 290. Holmes vs. Dole, Clark’s Cha. R. 73. Cable vs. Martin, 1 How. Miss. R. 561. Hunts vs. Clay, Lit. Sel. Cas. 26. An in Meux vs. Anthony, 6 Eng. 423, in this court, a similar principle was ecie, in which it w'as hel too that a efenant in chancery, by a reservation of his objection to the jurisiction, in his answer, might have the same benefit thereof, as if he ha aopte the more concise moe of efence, by pleaing or emurring; an that must be consiere as settle law here, 2 Daniell’s Ch. R. 819.
The question then narrows itself own to this inquiry, was the court wholly incompetent to grant relief in the case; or, in other wors, i the pleaings an proof evelope no subject matter over which the court ha jurisiction.
As a general proposition it is certainly true that a court of equity is not competent to affor reress by way of compensation, or amages, for a mere breach of contract, where the remey at law is plain, aequate, an complete, an where no peculiar equity intervenes; an the authorities cite by the counsel of the appellant are ecisive on that point. Such was the case of Dugan vs. Cureton, 1 Ark. 31. In that case, however, it was intimate that if a recovery at law coul not be obtaine, or mae available in consequence of insolvency, the court woul have jurisiction to retain a case an o justice between parties. An this too, accors with the case of Clark vs. Flint, 22 Pick. 231; where it was hel that a remey, by an action for amages against an insolvent person, is not such a plain, aequate an complete remey at law as to eprive a court of equity of jurisiction. In Kentucky, it has been frequently hel that non-resience is sufficient to warrant a court of equity in proceeing against the property of the absentee, although it is probable that the ecisions there may be influence to some extent by a statute which exists on the subject.

These cases are cite, not to .aopt their octrines, but to inicate to what extent respectable courts in sister states have felt themselves authorize to go in afforing equitable relief. In our view it is not necessary to ecie whether insolvency or non-resience, separately or together, are sufficient groun to uphol the jurisiction of a court of equity, because, in this case we think the jurisiction can be maintaine for other an clearer reasons.
•The bills charge Cockrell with a frauulent esign to efeat the collection of the eman by the removal of his property beyon our jurisiction before the creitor coul have any available an aequate remey at law. Recurring to the answer of Cockrell, it will be perceive that it is not at all calculate to inspire confience in his statements. He enie recollecting giving an obligation for cotton. That he i give it was amply establishe, not only by his own acknowlegments, but by ue proof of the execution of the instrument itself. He i not absolutely eny giving the obligation, but took shelter behin his recollection, an to say the least of it, his memory must have been exceeingly treacherous. He enie the present intention to remove his property beyon the jurisiction of the court, yet amitte that he intene to o so at a future time. Although he ha receive full consieration from Warner, yet, with his $50,-000 of unencumbere property in Louisiana, subject to execution, he never offere to pay any thing, either in money or property, but was manifestly eneavoring to avoi it. The answer was evasive an unsatisfactory, an not calculate to weaken the imputations of frau, as mae in the bill an supplemental bill. The latter he entirely faile to answer, although personally notifie in ue form of law. Mere non-payment of a ebt can never be evience of a esign to efrau, but there were circumstances attening this refusal, which gave a ifferent hue to the transaction. Putting all the circumstances together, we think it may be safely assume that a frauulent esign existe on his part to prevent the recovery of a just ebt.
The jurisiction of a court of equity, incases of actual or constructive frau, is too well establishe to be questione on the one han, or vinicate on the other; an as this case partakes of that character, we hol that the court ha jurisiction over the subject matter, an was competent to grant relief. An hence, the party having answere an put himself on the merits, without reserving any objection to the jurisiction, cannot be permitte to erive any avantage from it in this forum, an uner these circumstances. But were it otherwise, the jurisiction is, in our opinion, maintainable upon another groun, to which we will now avert. The answer of Cockrell was mae a cross bill against Warner, an interrogatories propoune, (Digest 230), an an accounting an general relief praye for, base on an allege misrepresentation on the part of Warner, as to the number of cattle an hogs sol; an also on a claim to abatement for eficiency, an on a mistake in the agreement. These grouns too, were connecte with the necessity of obtaining a iscovery from Warner, an surely it cannot be pretene that they o not lay a sufficient founation for equity jurisiction. Since the case of Wheat vs. Dotson, (7 Eng. 699), partial failure of consieration is cognizable at law in our courts, but because there is a remey at law it oes not estroy or impair the concurrent jurisiction of a court of equity over the same subject, but such jurisiction still continues on its ol founations. 1 Story's Eq. 64. Hempstea vs. Watkins, 1 Eng. 358. Sailly vs. Elmore, 2 Paige Ch. R. 499.
The cross bill foune on matters clearly cognizable inequity, supplie any efect in jurisiction, if any existe, an place the court in- possession of the whole cause, an impose the uty of granting relief to the party entitle to it. The original bill, an cross bill are but one cause (3 Daniel's Ch. Pl. 1943. 3 Ark. 312. 9 Johns. Ch. R. 252), an it certainly cannot be at all material from what particular source jurisiction arose, provie it existe in the case.
In Logan vs. McMillin, 5 Dana, 484, where a efenant enie frau, alleging that through mistake he ha not receive sufficient creit, it was hel that although the remey was complete at law, yet as the subject matter of the bill an cross bill were connecte, the court might take jurisiction. The case of Wickliffe vs. Clay, 1 Dana. 589, ecies asimilar principle. The cross bill gives a perfect reciprocity of proof to each party erivable from the answers of each, an its object is to enable the court to make a ecree on the whole merits, Story's Eq. Pl. 390. 4 Johns. Ch. R. 357. In Missouri vs. Iowa, 7 How. S. C. Rep. 660, to ajust bounaries, one State file a bill, an the other a cross bill, an it was sai by the court that each State occupie the position of a efenant, an that the whole case being before them,, such ecree coul be mae as the case require, Draper vs. Goren, 4 San. Ch. R. 214. In Hall vs. Erington, 8 B. Mon. 47, it was hel that although the claim of a plaintiff, in an action of' etinue for the hire of a slave, was a legal eman,"" yet if the-plaintiff be brought into chancery by the efenant in respect to the recovery of the slave an hire, the plaintiff may, by way of cross bill, have a ecree for such hire, which he otherwise coul not o, because his remey at law woul be perfect an complete, an his eman a legal one.
These authorities will suffice to emonstrate that the original an cross bill are but one cause; that both parties are as complainants, praying relief against each other, an haying in view the object of bringing the whole controversy before the court, to the en that it may be finally settle on the merits, by such ecree as the justice an equity of the case may require. In attaining this en it must frequently happen that mere legal emans on the one sie or the other, over which separately a- court of equity woul have no jurisiction, have to be passe ""on an relief affore. But this, so far from being objectionable,.is commenable, because it has a tenency to prevent a multiplicity of suits, in itself sufficient to give a court of equity jurisiction, although the subject matter, otherwise, may be of a legal nature an of legal cognizance.
In Cathcart vs. Robinson, 5 Peters. 278, Chief Justice Marshall sai: “it is well settle that, if the jurisiction attaches, the court will go on to o complete justice, although in its progress it may ecree on a matter which was cognizable at law.” If a bill shoul be file to recover amages for a breach of contract, unaccompanie by any equitable circa instances, an where the remey at law was perfect an complete, an the efenant, instea of emurring for want of equity, shoul answer on the merits an set up as cross matter, that the contract was obtaine frauulently an without consieration, an pray for its recision an for general relief; it coul harly be contene that the court on the one han, woul not have jurisiction to ecree a recision if the efence was establishe, or ecree relief to the complainant, on the other, if the efence was unsuccessful, although in the absence of the cross bill, which place the whole controversy before the court, no ecree coul be renere on the bill staning by itself, for want of jurisiction. The reasons for it have been, in part, intimate. The cross bill evelopes new ‘facts touching the same controversy within the acknowlege powers of a court of equity, an which, if true, woul entitle the efenant to relief, either partial or entire.
The whole case is at issue, an jurisiction, which i not before, now appears on the recor. If there is jurisiction for one purpose, there is jurisiction for all purposes. If a ecree may be renere for the efenant, one may be renere against him. The court having rightful possession of the cause, will procee to o full justice between the parties, for it is well sai that the jurisiction, having once rightfully attache, it shall be mae effectual for the purposes of complete relief. 1 Story's Eq. 64, (K.) Where the court has gaine jurisiction of the cause for one purpose it may retain it generally. 6 Johns. 596. 4 Cowen 728. In asking for equity, Cockrell was boun to o equity, which surely coul not consist in withholing what was really ue, rawing Warner from an equity into a legal forum, to pass through, another long an expensive litigation an probably at last be compelle to go back into equity again to make his recovery effectual. This woul be to encourage a multiplicity of suits, which is against the policy of the law an to be avoie at all times an in all courts. There was nothing in the case to rener a trial by jury inispensable, an if there ha been, it woul have been competent to irect an issue out of chancery for that purpose.
Either the chancellor or master, however, were quite as competent to ascertain the value of cotton, at a specifie time, as a jury woul be; for certainly it was an inquiry neither complicate nor ifficult, whether performe by one or the other.
That Cockrell was not able to prove the cross matter set up bj| him, coul not possibly efeat the jurisiction of the court, nor affect it any more than it woul be affecte in a case on a bill within the acknowlege powers of a court of equity, which the complainant shoul fail to establish. In that contingency, he woul obtain no ecree, but the jurisiction of the court over the subject matter woul be entirely unimpeachable.
It is not inappropriate to remark that, while it is necessary to keep up the prominent bounary lines between courts of law an equity, the jurisiction of the latter is not iminishing but enlarging, so as to keep pace with the extension of commerce, an the increasing wants of mankin. The narrow an unreasonable prejuices once entertaine against that jurisiction, have measurably, if not entirely, yiele to the intelligence an liberality of the age, an it is a truth, universally amitte, that far more injustice is one in common law courts than in courts of chancery, owing to the inability of the former to grasp the whole controversy without violating technical rules, as ancient as they are inflexible. Every one must feel that there is no anger to be apprehene from courts of chancery.
It is apparent that to entertain an objection to the jurisiction an rive Warner to assert his remey at law against a man, who is a non-resient, an has oubtless now remove his property beyon our jurisiction, an when that remey coul not, in the nature of things, be as complete an comprehensive as in chancery, woul be to visit upon him the entire loss of his ebt. We fin nothing in his conuct to warrant the infliction of such .a penalty, an nothing in that of Cockrell to entitle him to such a rewar.
Taking into consieration the position an circumstances of the whole case, we are satisfie the objection to the jurisiction ought not to prevail, an thinking that no injustice has been one to Cockrell by the ecree, we irect it to be in all things affirme with costs.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This bill was file by Conway, to enjoin proceeings on a jugment at law, obtaine by Ellison against him in the State of Tennessee, on the 24th January, 1846, upon personal service of process. After stating that he ha been appointe guarian of George M. Gray, who was a brother-law of the efenant, ha sent him to Nashville, to perfect an complete his eucation, an pai all the expenses an charges attening the same, which were allowe him in the settlement of his accounts, ha cease to be guarian on the 13th of January, 1842, on the war’s reaching the age of twenty-one, an ha turne over to the war his property, the complainant allege, in substance, that he never ha any transactions with, nor i he ever owe Ellison anything iniviually; that in 1840 the efenant wrote one or two letters to the complainant, claiming compensation for the boar of George M. Gray, to the amount of about forty ollars, to which the complainant replie by letter, that he expecte to receive a large sum of money for the use of his war, an if the account was sent uly probate, he woul pay it out of his own funs: that in 1843 Ellison visite Hempstea county, where complainant resie, an saw him on many occasions, but that no claim was prefere or mentione by Ellison, an complainant suppose that it ha been ajuste by Gray, an gave himself no concern about it; that in October, 1845, the complainant visite Nashville, Tennessee, an was there serve with a writ requiring him to answer sai Ellison to a plea of ebt, an in which writ the complainant was escribe to be “Guarian of George M. Gray;” that he consulte an eminent lawyer in Nashville, an truly represente to him all the material facts of the case, who assure the complainant that the action coul not be maintaine nor a recovery ha, without proof that he was still guarian of Gray, an the attorney plege himself to atten to an efen the action; an see that the necessary proof was auce to efeat it, in the event there shoul be no failure of evience on the part of the plaintiff; that knowing that the claim was unfoune an never coul be proven, an relying on his attorney to efeat the suit at the trial, he gave no further attention to it, an hear nothing more from it until 1849, when an action was brought on the jugment, which appeare to have been renere for $174 ebt, an $53 amages an costs; that his attorney, “either by frau an collusion with sai Ellison, or from some unaccountable conuct,” faile to appear an efen the suit as he ha promise to o, an jugment was renere against the complainant by efault, without the intervention of a jury, or the prouction of any evience whatever to establish the eman.
The efenant answere, enying the material allegations’™ the bill, an claime the benefit of the jugment, an also set up in the answer that the efence, if available, shoul have been mae at law, an that a court of equity ha no jurisiction to grant the relief praye for in the bill.
1. The jugment of a court of another State can only be impeache for want of jurisiction over the subject matter or person, or on the groun of frau, an hence it is not competent for the court, where the remey is sought, to inquire into mere irregularities, such as whether jugment was pronounce with or without a jury; or evience was or was not auce, or matters of a like nature; because it must be manifest, that to tolerate such objections, woul be in effect to exercise a revisory power over the jugment in a collateral proceeing, an thus estroy its valiity; The jugment itself closes the oor to such efects, an hence if the impute irregularities an errors in the bill ha been prove, still they coul have no effect whatever in the ecision of this cause, 2 Peters 162. 10 Peters 468, 475. 2 McLean 59.
There is but one allegation which approaches towars laying a founation for relief, an that is a general one, insinuating frau an collusion between the attorney an Ellison, to obtain the jugment. It is not a irect charge of frau, since it was mae alternatively, an couple with an allegation of “unaccountable conuct” in the attorney, the meaning of which is not efine, nor are we informe of what precise acts it consiste, or by what stanar to be measure.
As frau is never to be presume, it follows that, where it is relie as a groun of relief, the facts an circumstances constituting the frau, must be state in the bill with istinctness an precision, so that an issue will be forme which may apprize both parties of proof proper to be taken. Kenney vs. Kenney, 2 Ala. 571. Penerton vs. Galloway, 9 Ham. 178. Pleaings in equity an at law are esigne to apprize parties an the court of the material facts on which the asserte right epens, an to invoke attention to the points to which testimony shoul be irecte, Crockett vs. Lee, 7 Wheat. 527. Necessity imposes it as a uty, an justice requires that the ecree in all cases shoul conform to the allegations an proofs, an inee, the relaxation of these rules to any great extent woul be prouctive of confusion, uncertainty an injustice. This octrine was in effect recognize in Blakeney vs. Ferguson, 3 Eng. 276, an is not only entirely conformable to reason, but amply supporte by the best authorities. James vs. McKennon, 6 John. 559, 564. Cresset vs. Milton, 1 Ves.jr. 449. 3 Wen. 653.
Whatever is essential to the rights of the complainant an within his knowlege ought to be allege with such egree of certainty, as to give the efenant full information of the case he is calle on to answer; or on his failure to appear an efen, that the court may ecree on the face of the bill in favor of the Complainant, 1 Daniell’s Ch. Pr. 411, 421. Story Eq. Pl. 28. The same precision of statement is neither require or attainable in equity as in pleaings at law, but the meaning of the rule is, that the substantial grouns of relief must be state with such general certainty an precision, as to apprize the efenant of the tz’ue zzature of the case, an the points to which testiznony shoul be applie; an justice emans that in all cases, the rule shoul be observe. It is plain that the allegation in the bill lacks the requisite certainty in the matter of the frau, but even if it was sufficient, no proof whatever was taken or ofiere, either express or circumstantial, to sustain it; nor was it even prove that counsel ha been l’etaine at all. There can be no imputation more sezious or grievous against an attorney than that by frau or collusion with his aversaiy, he suffere azi unjust jugment to be obtaine against his client, an it shoul not only be istinctly charge an cleai'ly pi-ove, but one so regarless of the uties an forgetful of the obligations of a high an honorable profession shoul be promptly stricken from its rolls.
If the complainant was zzot inebte to the efenazzt, it was a strictly legal efezzce, an shoul have been mae in the suit at law in Tennessee. Dewees vs. Richarson, 1 A. K. Marsh. 313. He was boun to make it at law, an coul have no relief in equity unless he shows that he was prevente from oing so, by accient, surprise or mistake, or by the frau of the opposite party, without his own fault or negligence. Anrews vs. Fenter, 1 Ark. 186. Hempstea vs. Watkins, 1 Eng. 356. Lansing vs. Ey, 1 Johns. Ch. R. 51. Duncan vs. Lyon, 3 Johns. Ch. R. 351. Foster vs. Woo, 6 Johns. Ch. R. 89. This rule has. been too often recognize an enforce in this court to nee further emonstration. It is true that where courts of law an equity have concurrent jurisiction, a party may make his election as to the tribunal in which he will bring forwar his efence. If he prefers submitting it to a court of chancery, he must neither make nor attempt a efence at law; because the tribunal to which he first submits himself, must of necessity etermine the matter conclusively between the parties. Bently vs. Dillar, 1 Eng 84 Hempstea vs. Watkins, 1 Eng. 356. An this octiine waB re* affirme in Arrington vs. Washington, ecie at July term 1853, by this court, an in which case it was hel that the inquiry in such cases was, not what kin of efence was mae, but whether a efence atlaw was attempte at all, an if so he was preclue from coming into chancery. The rule oes not apply, where the efence offere is of an equitable nature, an coul notbe mae at law, because in that case there is but one tribunal competent to affor relief. Hawkins vs. Depreist, 4 Munf. 469. Sauners vs. Marshall, 4 Hen. & Munf. 459. Spencer vs. Wilson, 4 Munf. 130. Fish vs. Lane, 2 Hayw. 342.
An it is quite immaterial whether the party efens at law or not; for in either event, he is not barre from asserting his right in equity, as to his eqitable efence, by which expression is intene a efence not available at law in any contingency whatever. But the efence set forth in the bill was not of that character. It was purely legal, unaccompanie by equitable circumstances, an no sufficient excuse has been state to show why it was not mae in the suit in Tennessee. The complainant was not ignorant of the facts on which the efence reste, for he avers that he communicate them fully to his counsel, an was informe by the latter that the action coul notbe maintaine, an he chose to rest easy on that avice. No accient is pretene to have prevente it, an frau an collusion are istinctly enie an not prove. The claim for relief is narrowe own to the common case of a person, who having a strict legal efence, neglects to make it at law, an thus forever loses its benefit. Even if a retainer ha been prove an gross' negligence in the counsel, unaccompanie by frau, or unfairness, still to attempt to relieve from its consequences woul be to venture into a vast ocean of litigation without chart or compass to guie us. It woul, in fact, amount to an extension of privileges to one class of persons, which are enie to others, thus estroying that equality which is the boast of a court of equity, an shoul never be lost sight of in its ecisions an ecrees.
The injure party, however, is not without reress; since the attorney is responsible in a civil action for amages, arising from negligence an inattention to the interests of the client. Denton vs. Noyes, 7 Johns. 297.
It was sai correctly an pertinently, in Barrow vs. Jones, 1 J. J. Marsh. 470, that “ courts cannot give reress against the other party tQ the suit, but it? must be sought in a new action. An in Lawson vs. Bettison, 7 Eng. 417, this court hel that where a party employe an attorney at law, either to prosecute or efen his suit in the courts of the country, he presents him to the opposite party an to the worl as his accreite agent, an as such he must be conclue by his acts or omissions where no frau or unfairness is mae to appear. The bill, taking every statement on that subject to be true, fails to show ue iligence on the part of the complainant; but, on the contrary, evinces that he gave himself no concern about the suit, an never attempte to furnish evience, if any existe, to prevent a recovery, an certainly that was not the uty of the attorney. It is a carinal rule in equity, commene by its goo sense, that no man can be relieve from the consequence of negligence, carelessness or inattention; because to o that woul be to make litigation enless, rob the vigilant of their avantages, an overwhelm courts of equity by the pressing multitue of slothful suitors. In their organization courts of equity are properly an necessarily veste with a large iscretion, but still it is a iscretion epening on establishe ari well efine principles, an in every view of the subject, it is clear that the complainant was not entitle to the relief praye for in his bill, an the same shoul have been ismisse.
Unless in ai of a suit at law, no injunction shoul be grante where the applicant for it oes not submit to a jugment at law, or as it is technically terme — confesses jugment. Matthews vs. Douglass, Cooke 136. Nelson vs Owen, 3 Ireell Ch R. 178. The reason is, that if he oes not succee in equity, he might still go on an efen at law, prosecute a writ of error, or take an appeal an thus unreasonably elay his aversary in the obtainment of his rights. 1 Ma. Ch. 132, 1 Vernon 120. No person can be allowe to litigate at law an in chancery at the same time, as to the same subject matter, an an election to resort to the latter forum, lias the effect of closing the oor of the former to him, so far that if he fails his aversary may, without further litigation, avail himself of his recovery at law by means of an execution.
When an action has been commence, Lor Roslyn sai a plaintiff must be permitte to go on to trial an jugment, an that the injunction only staye execution. Franco vs. Franco, 2 Cox 420. Een lays own this rule, that “the plaintiff may procee so far as to be able to take out execution the instant that the injunction is issolve.” Een on Injunctions 97. Therefore after an interlocutory jugment, as by efault or a emurrer, the plaintiff at law may go on to ascertain his amages, 3 P. Wms. 147. Daniell aopting the language of Een, says that after the commencement of a suit at law, the plaintiff may procee so far that he may be in a situation immeiately on the issolution of the injunction, to take out execution. 3 Daniell's Ch. Pr. 1819. In Warwick vs. Norvale, 1 Leigh 96, it was expressly ecie that an injunction can only be grante on conition that the efenant confesses jugment at law, an if a party refuses to submit to such jugment, the injunction will be enie, or if one has been grante it may for such cause be issolve. An this is not a rule of practice to be change or moifie at pleasure, or to be enforce or not, as the chancellor shall think fit ¿ but it is one resting on ancient an well efine principles of justice an equity, an having in view the suppression of litigation an the preservation of the just rights of the averse party. Ham vs. Schuyler, 2 Johns. Ch. R. 140.
As far as the recor inicates in this case, the proceeings at law seem to have been arreste at the commencement, an no jugment to have been confesse at law, an if that is the fact the efenant is now entitle to jugment for his eman. If jugment was renere he is entitle to execute it without further elay.
The ecree must be reverse an the cause remane with irections to issolve the injuction with amages accoring to the statute, that the efenant be allowe to procee at law, an the bill be ismisse at the costs of the complainant.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The petitioner represents that he is the plaintiff in a certain action at law, pening in the Pulaski Circuit Court, now in session, the suit being brought upon a promissory note, which ha been assigne to the plaintiff. That the efenant in the Circuit Court, uring its present term, after having oyer of the instrument sue on, emurre for a variance between the escription of the plaintiff’s name as set out in the eclaration an that isclose by the instrument given on oyer. That the only variance consiste in this, that the plaintiff sue as Anre, an the assignment as fille up, an which was one by the plaintiff’s attorney through mere inavertence was Anrew,it being the same Christian name, accoring as it is spelt in French or English. That the court there has sustaine the emurrer for the suppose variance, an thereupon the plaintiff, by leave of the court, has correcte the mistake in the filling up of the assignment, by inserting Anre instea of Anrew, That the efenant making no further efence, the plaintiff move for jugment for want of a plea; but the court there has, on motion of the efenant, an without any showing being mae therefor, orere the cause to be continue until the next term, thereby enying the petitioner his legal right to have jugment for his ebt; wherefore he prays that a manamus issue against the juge of that court commaning him to set asie the orer of continuance an progress with the cause.
It will be concee that a manamus is the only aequate specific remey for a suitor, where the inferior court refuses to exqrcise its jurisiction, an will not procee to ajuicate a cause pening before it, of which it has cognizance, an where no reason appears for such refusal. The manamus will go to compel the court to act, but not to control its juicial iscretion, by irecting it what jugment to give, or to review the correctness of any ecision mae uring the progress of a cause; else the manamus woul become an inirect substitute for the final review by writ of error or appeal. The proceeing by manamus to compel a Circuit Juge, sitting as a chancellor, to grant an injunction as praye upon any given case presente to him by the bill, an which he has refuse, is in the nature of an. appeal allowe by statute, from some interlocutory orer or ecree of the inferior court.
Accoring to the report of Dixon vs. Feil, 5 Eng. 243, mainly relie on by the petitioner here, it was, as we think, an extreme case to warrant the issuance of a manamus. But amitting, upon the authority of the opinion in that case, that a manamus will lie to control the iscretion of the inferior court in the continuance of a cause, where that iscretion is so palpably abuse as to amount to a enial of justice, the case here is ifferent.
The court below ecie the emurrer. If the petitioner was aggrieve by the ecision, his only remey was to rest upon it an suffer final jugment, which coul be reviewe on a writ of error of appeal. He might then require this court to ecie whether the groun of emurrer was frivolous, or the variance so trifling as to he amenable, without occasioning any surprise or pretext for elay to the efenant. The petitioner acquiesce in the ecision upon the emurrer by making the amenment conformable with iff Accoring to the case presente by the petition, it will be impossible to grant the manamus without reviewing the correctness of that ecision. By the 6th rule of practice for the Circuit Courts, aopte by this court at July term 1848, when a emurrer to a eclaration is sustaine, the emurrant is entitle to a continuance of the cause: an while that rule remains in force, the continuance follows of necessity from the ecision of the court sustaining the emurrer, no matter how erroneous in point of law.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was a suit in chancery, institute by the appellees, Avery, Wayne & Co., Thomas Hite an others, against Merrick & Fenno, an William Fisher.
From the recor sent here, the material facts of the case appear ;to be as follows :
The complainants resiing at Cincinnati, Ohio, having furnishe supplies to the steamboat P. H. White, then running in the Ohio river, an owne by William Fisher, settle their respective emans against the boat, on the 7th August, 1849, by taking the note in some instances of the owner, an in others of the master of the boat, either ue presently or at so many ays from ate. Soon afterwars the boat left the Ohio, an in the latter part of August, was brought by Fisher into the Arkansas, -where she continue to run. While navigating the Arkansas river the boat became inebte to the efenants, Merrick & Fenno, resiing at Little Rock, for avances an supplies furnishe in this State, amounting to near four hunre ollars; an -on the 6th of October, 1847, they took a bill of sale of the boat from Fisher, expresse to be in consieration of their having just ■claims against the boat, which he was esirous shoul be pai. The bill of sale containe a stipulation to the effect, that when .all the claims then hel by Merrick & Fenno shoul be pai an satisfie, they woul in goo faith, re-sell, re-convey, an re-eliver the boat, her engine, tackle, &c., to Fisher, on his reasonable request, an in the meantime rener accounts of the business of the boat, or permit him to inspect its books on request. This instrument, which clearly was a mortgage security, was never file for recor. It is fully prove that Merrick & Fenno, notwithstaning the positive enial an averments in their answer, immeiately upon the execution of the bill of sale, took possession of the boat an commence running her, for the purpose of re-imbursing what she owe them, an that such was the intention of the parties in executing the bill of sale, is inferable from its tenor.
Whether the boat left the Ohio river with the knowlege or consent of the complainants oes not appear. Down to the time of taking the bill of sale so calle, Merrick & Fenno ha no notice of the claims of the Ohio creitors against the boat, but of which they were shortly afterwars apprize. Those creitors pursue Fisher to Arkansas, an brought suits in personam, against him* for the amount of their respective emans, in all of which jugments were renere against Fisher, on the common law sie of' the Pulaski Circuit Court, on the 25th April, 1848.
In the meantime the boat, not paying the expenses of running; her, an continuing to fall in ebt to Merrick & Fenno, so that-incluing what they ha avance before unertaking to run the-boat for Fisher’s account, she owe them for supplies, stores,, cash avances, wharfage, &c., a balance of $1,751, an on the-7th of June, 1848, they avertise her for sale at auction on the-19th ay of that month.
Two ays before this sale took place, the complainants file-their bill, the scope of which was, that by the law of Ohio, their claims were liens upon the boat, entitle to be specifically enforce an satisfie against her, in preference to any claim which the efenants, Merrick & Fenno, might have subsequently acquire. The complainants ha. cause executions to be issue upon their jugments at law against Fisher, which being returne milla bona they claime, in another aspect of their bill, to be entitle in equity, as jugment creitors of his, to subject the boat or its procees in the hans of Merrick & Fenno to satisfy the jugments; upon the groun that Merrick & Fenno ha no real or vali claim, an in respect of which they praye a iscovery an account, but only hel possession of the boat as trustees for Fisher.
The boat, when sol, i not bring enough to pay the balance ue Merrick & Fenno, who receive the procees of the sale,., amounting to $1,250.
At the hearing it was agree that the law of Ohio, in regar to claims against boats an vessels, shoul be rea in evience, an it was amitte that the supplies &c., originally furnishe by the complainants in Ohio, were such as 'were provie for by that law. The chancellor allowe Merrick & Fenno to retain the amount of their eman, being four hunre ollars, against the boat at the time of the execution of the mortgage, but ecree that they shoul pay the resiue of the procees arising from the sale, to be istribute pro rata among the complainants.
While the appellants conten that the complainants below ha no lien, it is argue that, conceing they might have ha such lien, they lost it by taking notes of the master or owner, thereby giving a personal creit to them, an also by merging their emans in jugments against the owner. If these were the only questions to be ecie, we might have no ifficulty in holing, that where by analogy to maritime law or usage, a material man has a triple remey against the master, the owner, an the boat, he may pursue them all, inepenently of each other, until one satisfaction is ha. In such cases a reasonable creit is allowe to be extene to the boat for the benefit of commerce, else there woul be no necessity for any lien. So the taking of a note not negotiate or outstaning woul not waive the lien, unless some aitional security were obtaine, or uner circumstances manifesting an intention to o so. Accoring to what is the law of the place, the simple contract eman might be merge in the note, an a jugment in personam woul bar another action on the note; but that jugment while unsatisfie, being but a security, woul be no bar to a istinct proceeing in romiot the same ebt, supposing such were the case here.
But the essential enquiry is, whether the complainants upon the facts state, ha any lien in Ohio, which they can enforce in this State as against the efenants, an this enquiry involves many consierations of serious ifficulty. In the first place the the istinction between the ifferent kins of lien is to be observe. The common law lien is a right to retain a thing until some claim upon it is satisfie, an if possession be given up the lien is lost. Statutory liens, among which are chattel mortgages, o not epen upon possession of the thing. They import a right to prior satisfaction out of the property boun by the lien, an being the creatures of positive law, are usually regiilate by a system of registry, operating as constructive notice; so that they take effect, an are to be satisfie accoring to priority of recor! A maritime lien oes not epen upon possession or registry of any contract which confers the lien. It exclues the iea of possession or registry. Nor o such liens take effect accoring to priority of time; in many instances, when they come to be satisfie the orer of priority is inverte. The maritime law is part of the law of nations, a peculiar system suppose to be base on principles of the most enlightene equity, an proceeing accoring to rules of its own wholly unlike the common law. It concerns vessels which navigate the seas,- an the classes of persons engage in navigating, or who contract in respect of such vessels! The maritime lien is one of the necessities attening commerce between foreign countries. It is a claim upon the vessel an the lien consists in the right to enforce it by seizure or proceeing in rent. Unlike the liens given by the local law of any nation, which if respecte out of its jurisiction, are only so by comity, this light to satisfaction out of the vessel, where it exists,' aheres to an follows her everywhere. So the jugment of the amiralty court in rem is of universal obligation, an conclusive upon all persons intereste in the subject of its ajuication.
By the feeral constitution, the"" juicial power of the Unite States extens to all cases of amiralty an maritime jurisiction. The States, for wise reasons, iveste' themselves of all right to exercise any jurisiction over the subject, unless in the absence of any legislation by Congress, or by its sufferance or permission.
Congress by the juiciary act of 1789, in organizing the feeral courts, conferre original jurisiction in all such cases exclusively upon the istrict courts, saving to suitors in all cases, the right of a common law remey, where the common law is competent to affor it. The courts of the Unite States, unconsciously aopting the prevailing practice an efinition of amirality jurisiction in Englan, an without consiering its true nature an esign, were not ispose to exten their jurisiction beyon cases occurring upon the high seas, or where the tie ebbs an flows; The Jefferson, 10 Wheat. 428; Thackeray vs. The Farmer, Gilpin 524: an the ecisions of the State courts have proceee upon the iea that all authority, though in the nature of amiralty jurisiction, not falling within that efinition, rightfully belonge or ha been relinquishe to therm At an early ay the necessity arose for local legislation on this subject in the Atlantic States. In New York, Massachusetts an Pennsylvania liens were given by statute to mariners, an to those builing, equipping, or furnishing materials for ships in omestic ports. The Unite States courts in amiralty recognize an enforce such liens where they were expressly given by the local laws. But these statutes were carefully guare, an their beneficial operation was to exten the privilege of the maritime lien upon seagoing vessels, for their builing or equipment in omestic ports, just as that lien existe in Europe, an woul have prevaile in Englan, an so escene to this country, but for the jealousy of the common law. The States, for all the purpose of amiralty jurisiction, were regare as foreign to each other; the maritime lien attache to ships belonging to one State, repaire or equippe in the ports of another State; an any local legislation attempting to limit or control this jurisintion, woul be isregare, as unconstitutional; The Barque Chusan, 2 Story 464.
The growing commerce of the new States upon the waters of the Mississippi, where the amiralty courts never ha assume jurisiction in any form, require som'e legislation of a ifferent character for afforing prompt an efficient remeies against boats an vessels. The statute of Ohio passe in 1840, enacts “that steamboats an other water crafts navigating the waters within or borering upon this State, shall be liable for ebts contracte on account thereof, by the master, owner, stewar, consignee, or other agent, for materials, supplies or labor, in the builing, repairing, furnishing or equipping the same, or ue for wharfage; an also for amages arising out of any contract for the transportation of goos or persons, or for injuries one to persons or property by such craft, or for any amage or injury one by the captain, mate, or other officer thereof, or by any person uner orer or sanction of either of them, to any person who may be a passenger or han on such steamboat, or other water craft, at the time of the infliction of such amage or injury.” For any such eman the person aggrieve may procee against the master an owner, or against the craft itself. The remaining sections provie, that upon complaint, an affiavit being mae, the vessel may be seize, an unless security be put in on behalf of the owner, it is hel in the custoy of the court, an sol on execution to satisfy such jugment as may be renere; the overplus of procees if any being returne to the owner or his agent, an if the procees of the sale fall short of satisfying the jugment, the balance remains to be collecte ®n execution as upon orinary jugments.
In the case of The Velocity, 3 Law Reporter 61, ecie by Juge Conklin, of the northern istrict of New York, the question was whether material men, claiming a lien uner this law of Ohio for supplies furnishe in that State to a vessel subsequently libelle an sol uner proceeings in amiralty in New York, coul have their claims satisfie out of the surplus procees in court arising from the sale of the vessel.
As the amiralty courts woul enforce liens of a maritime nature, when mae so by local statutes, such claimants woul also be allowe to come in for a share of any surplus procees. The question was therefore presente, whether the statute of Ohio gave any such lien, an upon a thorough review of it, Juge Conklin was of opinion, that it i not confer a lien either expressly or by necessary implication. He refers to the legislation in the Atlantic States, an quotes the provisions of the New York statute, which explicitly gave a lien on vessels, suborinate to that of seamen’s wages, for work an materials, an stores furnishe within that State, an so for wharfage an port expenses, which liens are accurately efine, an limite in uration, an the moe of enforcing- them prescribe so as to ensure publicity, an an opportunity for all claimants to interplea. An after contrasting the provisions of the Ohio statute, which neither containe the wor “lien” or any expression of like import, which mae the boat liable, not merely to mechanics an material men, but for all amages though unliquiate, arising from any breach of contract in the transportation of freight or passengers, or for injuries to the same, an for torts committe by any officer of the boat without limit as to place of injury or uration of the liability for it, an without any safeguars to ensure'to averse claimants publicity in the ajuication, his opinion was “that in eclaring a vessel liable for ebts contracte on her account, an for the amages specifie in the act, nothing more was intene than to confer the privilege of arresting the vessel by mesne process as the property of the elinquent party, an unless security shoul be given, of having it etaine in the custoy of the law to satisfy the jugment, if any, which the plaintiff might recover.” In short, that it was nothing more than a special attachment law where the process is against the boat instea of the person, an the lien is by virtue of the levy of the attachment.
In the subsequent case of Glenny vs. The Globe, 3 Law. Rep. 488, Juge Conklin carrie the foregoing views to a much greater extent. The case was that the Globe, a Michigan vessel, owne in Detroit, was libelle by Glenny, in May, 1850, in the amiralty court in New York, uner the act of Congress of 1845, for supplies an materials, which he ha furnishe to her at Buffalo, prior to the 10th of September, 1849. A claimant of the vessel answere that she ha been sue an seize in a court of Ohio uner the statute of that State, for supplies furnishe to her at Clevelan after the 20th of September, 1849, in which suits jugr ments were renere in February, 1850, upon which the vessel was sol in March following, an uner that sale he erive his title. Juge Conklin thought the Ohio statute was voi, because against natural justice, inasmuch as it i not contemplate or profess to provie any means of notice, actual or constructive, beyon the act of seizure, of the penency of the suit to averse claimants; an that the State court ha no jurisiction, because the statute was an interference with the amiralty jurisiction of the Unite States courts. Though his opinion may be a forcible argument against the policy, if not the valiity of the Ohio statute, the ecision was reverse on appeal to the Circuit Court. The Globe, 5 Law. Rep. 421. Juge Nelson hel that the State Court ha a concurrent jurisiction, reserve to it by the act of Congress of 1845, that its jugment was, upon a proceeing in rem, obligatory upon all the worl, not affecte by the absence of notice to any party intereste, an that the sale uner it passe a complete title to the purchaser. His opinion, however, might have reste on another groun, state as existing in the case, that the libellant ha appeare to the suits in Ohio, an conteste the proceeings.
The statute of Wisconsin is almost the same in terms as that of Ohio, an in the case of Pulteny vs. The Sloop Celestino, 4 Am. Law Journal 164, where a omestic vessel was libelle in amiralty by omestic creitors, uner the act of 1845, the istrict juge refuse to entertain jurisiction because the statute of Wisconsin i not confer a lien which the courts of the Unite States in amiralty coul recognize. In the case of Davis vs. A New Brig, Gilpin 473, Juge Hopicinson entertaine jurisiction in such a case, upon the phraseology of the Pennsylvania statute, making vessels in certain cases liable to workmen, material men, &c., “ in preference to an before any other ebts ue an owing from the owners thereof.” So the Arkansas statute on this subject gives a similar preference to certain classes of creitors against the boat, over all other ebts ue from her owners, (except wages of mariners an boatmen,) which might materially influence the construction to be given to it.
The Supreme Court of Missouri ecie in Noble vs. The steamboat St. Anthony, 12 Missouri, 261, See also, The steamboat Rariton vs. Pollar, 10 ib. 584; that the water craft law of that State, authorizing suits against boats an vessels, ha no extra territorial operation, an woul only be enforce in the courts of that State for emans accruing within the State against vessels navigating its waters.
In the case in 12 Missouri, it was amitte that the plaintiff’s claim accrue against the boat while in Pennsylvania, where by statute it was a lien upon the vessel. The court sai: “The Pennsylvania law, like ours, is local an must be enforce in the moe pointe out in their statute, an in the courts acquiring jurisiction uner it. Our statute oes not authorize the lien acquire uner the laws of Pennsylvania to be enforce here, an there is no principle of common or international law which will justify sucha pretension.” Yet the same court, in Finney vs. The steam boat Fayette, 10 Missouri, 619, not appearing to take any istinction between a omestic an foreign jugment, accor.e to a proceeing in Illinois, uner a like statute of that State, for the attachment of boats an vessels, the conclusive an uni•versal obligation of an amiralty sentence in rem.
In Frink vs. King, 3 Scam. 150, it was hel that, uner their statute, the affiavit to obtain process woul be clearly efective, jf it i not state that the claimant’s services on the boat ha been renere whilst she was running in the navigable waters of fhat State.,
In Louisiana, as woul appear from the case of Lee vs. His creitors, 2 Annual Rep. 599, the privilege or lien on boats owne, or coming within the jurisiction of that State, for work or materials furnishe, is limite to sixty ays, an in the istribution of procees among creitors, priorities are regulate by the law of the place where the vessel is foun, isregaring privileges given by the law of the place where the contract was mae, an though, as in that case, the contest was among non-resient claimants.
The Supreme Court of Michigan, in Robinson vs. The steam boat Re Jacket, 1 Mich. 171, ecie upon the statute of that State, passe in 1839, proviing for the collection of emans against boats an vessels, that it only gave a new an cumulative remey, an as it i not give a lien on the vessel until seizure uner the attachment, there was no reason why foreign creitors shoul not be allowe to come into the courts of Michigan an avail themselves of the remey to assert their claims against a boat. See also, Moses vs. The steam boat Missouri, ib. 507. But uner the construction of a subsequent statute, passe, in 1847, an. which gave a specific lien on vessels in favor of certain emans,, the court, were constraine, much against their views of its policy or propriety, to limit its operation to contracts mae an injuries-receive within that State. Biwell vs. Whitaker, ib. 469.
The construction of the water craft law of Ohio has been the-occasion of much ifficulty to her own courts. Notwithstaning; what was sai in The steamboat Monarch vs. Finley, 10 Ohio, 384, that the law in question gives a lien upon crafts for certain, claims against them, the court, in the case of The Canal boat Huron vs. Simmons, 11 Ohio, 461, take a clear istinction betweem the statute of New York, which is a lien law, an that of Ohio,., which treats the boat as a person, an makes it responsible for all ebts contracte for its use an for injuries one by its officers an crew. An in Jones vs. The steamboat Commerce, 14 Ohio, 408, it was irectly ecie that the statute in question gives no lien except by proviing for the seizure of the craft, which bins the property an creates the lien. Although this construction mae the statute nothing more than an attachment law, it coul not be use as a remey for the collection of emans or for causes of action' which accrue beyon the limits of that State, Champion vs. Juntzen, 16 Ohio, 91, Goosell vs. The brig Lewis, ib. 178; an this, notwithstaning the supplies were furnishe in Michigan, where by comity uner a like statute, Ohio creitors ■ might have sue.
The Ohio law continue to be so construe until 1848, when,, by statute its operation was extene to all cases, whether they arose within or without the territory of the State of Ohio. The schooner Aurora vs. Dobbie, 17 Ohio, 125.
An yet the Supreme Court of that State, following the leaning of previous cases, ecie in Prevost vs. Wilson, 17 Ohio, 359, that a mortgage upon a vessel, execute an uly registere in-New York, where she belonge, shoul be .postpone to emans against the vessel subsequently accrue in Ohio, where she was attache uner the water craft law. An so it was hel in Johnson vs. Rogers & Sherlock, 9 West. Law Journ. 88, that the statutory ebts against a steamboat must be first pai in preference to a prior mortgage.
The court argue, that if the lien of the mortgage coul take preceence over a subsequent seizure, it leas to this result, that if a steamboat or other water craft is uner mortgage, no suit coul be prosecute against her, notwithstaning the provisions of the law of 1840; an to give the statute that construction woul be to a to it a proviso, “ that such boat shall^not be encumbere by mortgage,” afforing the owners of boats a very convenient metho of avoiing the force of the act.
An in Johnson vs. Rogers & Sherlock, the court conclue that “ it was the object of the Legislature to enable a mechanic who labore on a boat, or any party supplying her with necessaries, to retain a lien on her superior to that even of any owner or mortgagee.” Because, as the court sai, he who takes a chattel mortgage on a boat may protect his mortgage if he will keep the boat in his possession, but the moment he suffers her to run on the river, he gives a license to those in charge of her to contract ebts on the faith of the boat, which shall attach as a lien superior to his mortgage. This principle is of the essence of a maritime lien, anfi the court there state the true groun on which it procees, that is, the implie authority of those having a vessel in charge, to make her liable to all who labor or furnish materials on the faith of the boat, without regar to her owners.
At the same time the Ohio statute is so unlike a maritime law that it oes not purport to give any lien for the wages of mariners or boatmen, an it was not without a struggle against the strong opinion of part of the court, Lewis vs. The schooner Clevelan, 12 Ohio, 341, that they were amitte at all as claims against the vessel.
Amist all this apparent confusion an uncertainty, the argument, fairly state in favor of the parties here claiming a lien uner the law of Ohioj may be consiere as having much, force. We fin that the proceeings against boats an vessels, uner the various local laws of the States, have always assimilate themselves to proceeings in amiralty. The jugment in rem, is usually hel conclusive every where, upon all those intereste in the boat, or having emans against her, prior to the conemnation an sale. See also, The steamboat Rover vs. Stiles, 5 Blackfor, 483. Steamboat Raritan vs. Smith, 10 Missouri, 527. Where the statute gives a lien, in the nature of a maritime lien, the courts of amiralty have enforce it as such, paramount to any sale or mortgage by the owner, Peroux vs. Howar, 7 Peters 340; an in The Jerusalem 2 Gallison, 345, a local common law lien was so enforce. The schooner Marion, 1 Story 69. The rule in amiralty is ahere to, that as between claims which rank in the same class, or where no preferences are given by the statute, or -where it makes the lien to consist in the seizure, the iligent creitor who first seizes has the preference, an other claimants are to be satisfie out of the res, in the orer of their suits, The People vs. The Juges of New York, 1 Wen. 40; opinion of Juge Nelson in the Globe. There woul seem to be the same necessity for a law of our inlan rivers as for a law of the seas. The interests involve are equally important. Steamboats are no more chattels than ships, an no less migratory between ports in jurisictions foreign to each other.
In most of the leaing subjects of amiralty jurisiction, the analogies are the same, an the like reasons exist why certain liabilities shoul attach specifically to the vessel. It might be sai, that though the Ohio statute gives no lien, it gives the claim against the vessel, an the right to seize in satisfaction of that claim; an this is the substance of a maritime lien. The rightto procee against the res in amiralty, is calle a lien, but it is by no means an absolute or unqualifie right of preference. For it is a settle principle of the maritime law, though the rules on the subject rest much in iscretion an are not clearly efine, that all such liens ought to be enforce by suit within a reasonable time, an they may be waive, postpone, or lost by neglect. The leaing iea which pervaes these local statutes is, that the boat an the owner are istinct from each other, so that the boat js liable, as it were apon her own contracts, or for her own torts. The master or owner may be liable in personam, for the same, ,an the boat may be liable for the general ebts of the owner; but the boat is first liable for her own ebts, which, by analogy •with the maritime law, ought to follow her every where, an without regar to any sale, or incumbrance upon her by contract of the owner, into the hans of a purchaser with or without notice.
But amitting that the policy of the Ohio statute is to confer a lien, though it oes not o so in express terms, there are opposing reasons conclusive to our mins, why such a lien shoul not be specifically enforce in this forum, in preference to any subsequent lien or liability,, vali by the laws of this State, which has accrue against the same vessel, whilst engage in navigating our waters. In coming to this conclusion we are not influence by the refusal of the Ohio courts to acknowlege a reciprocal obligation to enforce similar liens, which accrue in other States. For that matter, the amenment to the statute of Ohio in 1848, allowing foreigners to pursue in that State the remey against boats given by her own law, is inconsistent with the iea of enforcing a specific lien which accrue uner a foreign law.
In amiralty cases it is the nature of the contract or liability, which confers jurisiction, without reference to the law of the country where the liability was incurre, the contract mae, or to be performe; or as regars the feeral courts, the citizenship of the parties. Because the amiralty law is one of universal obligation, pervaing all countries where its rules are in theory at least, the same. If, therefore, the courts of this State coul be calle on to enforce, by analogy to the maritime law, a lien upon a boat or vessel, which accrue in Ohio, we woul not o so upon any rule of comity between States, foreign, or in some respects foreign to each other. We shoul enforce it, not because the local law of Ohio ha given the lien; but because the maritime law or usage gave it. Wo question ought to arise of conflict between the laws of this ,or a foreign State, or whether we woul enforce such lien, provie it i not interfere with the rights of our own citizens, but because the lien, vali in one place, is vali every where, an followe the vessel into this State. Upon the same principle we shoul respect a jugment in rem, with all its conclusive consequences, pronounce in the court of an'other State. But by act of Congress, in 1845, the amiralty jurisiction of the istrict courts was extene over the lakes an rivers connecting the same. The constitutionality of this act was sustaine by the Supreme Court of the Unite States, in the case of 'The propeller Genesee Chief vs. Fitzhugh, 12 Howar, 450, a ecision fraught with the most important results. The court, overruling the case of the Jefferson, hel that the grant of amiralty an maritime jurisiction was of the subject matter over public navigable waters, where commerce maybe carrie on between ifferent States or nations, an not accoring to the acciental efininition of it in Englan, where tie water an navigable water are, with unimportant exceptions, if any, synonymous terms.Upon the same istinction the States ha not hesitate to exten their rights of sovereignty over inlan navigable streams. The ecision in 12 Howar, was the unavoiable consequence of amitting the several States to be sovereign an foreign to each other, in respect of all powers an jurisictions, not elegate to’ the Feeral Union.
It follows from the reasoning in that case, that the juicial power of the feeral courts in amiralty, heretofore ormant*» really extens over all public navigable rivers, by means of which intercourse may be carrie on between ifferent States. If this be so, it is ifficult to conceive how any vestige of such jurisiction (apart from isputes about its confines) coul exist in the' State courts. The act of 1845, apparently frame as a cautious-experiment aapte to the exigencies of commerce upon the lakes,, oes not confer it upon them, but only leaves to suitors the option, which they ha uner the juiciary act of 1789, of pursuing' any concurrent remeies that may be affore by the State laws.But those are common law remeies, an though moule by statute to resemble amiralty proceeings, the lien is local an the' sentence of conemnation upon it can have no more extra territorial operation than a ischarge uner a State bankrupt law, or a jugment in rem, upon an orinai-y attachment suit, which, however conclusive upon persons an property foun within the State, woul not conclue the paramount title of any one beyon the jurisiction, an who coul not be mae subject to it. In the absence of legislation by Congress, now certainly much neee, extening the amiralty jurisiction over our western rivers, it woul be unwise an impolitic for the State courts to assume any such jurisiction, epenant on the caprice o r vicissitues of local legislation. The ecisions of the State courts, proceeing accoring to the course of the common law, an without any common appellate tribunal to harmonize inevitable conflicts, woul only rener more insecure the titles to the vast amount of property passing between ifferent States. The owner of a vessel in such case woul selom realize its value, because the purchaser coul not know whether it was free from incumbrance. The only safety is foun to be in the settle aversion of the common law, which couples the iea of a lien with possession, to all restrictions, in the shape of secret or contingent liens, upon the alienation of personal property.
Chattel mortgages, where the mortgager, being entruste with the possession, is enable to practice a frau upon innocent purchasers in another State, are but hazarous securities, an there woul be no imperative obligation upon the foreign jurisiction to prefer the claim of the mortgagee pursuing the property, though he come in the character of owner, having title by contract. In every view of this case, we must say, that if the Ohio claimants, now before the court, ha any lien by the law of that State, it was lost when they suffere the boat to epart beyon the jurisiction of Ohio.
Regaring the suit as a creitor’s bill, an without consiering any objection to the form of it as such, the relief sought must also be enie.. Waiving any oubt as to the correctness of the ecision in Main vs. Alexaner, 4 Eng. 112, an conceing that Merrick & Fenno ha no lien either by virtue of a mortgage recore, or a plege in possession, in the absence of any allegation or proof of a frauulent combination with Fisher, his ee of mortgage to them was certainly vali an bining, as between the parties to it. The complainants seeking equity, an within the scope of the bill, coul only charge Merrick & Fenno, as the trustee, or ebtor of Fisher, for such resiue as might remain in their hans after their amitte claims against him were satisfie.

1862672,Owen vs. Lavine,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins
elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was a suit originally commence before a justice of the peace, by Lavine against Owen, upon the following instrument of writing, file with the magistrate as the founation of the complaint :
“Hillsboro, January, 1848.
Mr. E. M. Owen,
Please pay B. Lavine, or orer, forty-four 35-100 ollars, value .receive, out of the procees of my present crop of cotton.
. (signe) , W. L. FOSTER.
(Enorse), I accept the within orer, January, 1848.
(signe) E. M. OWEN.”
At the trial e novo, in the Circuit Court upon appeal, jugment went against Owen for the amount of money specifie in the orer, an it appears from his bill of exceptions, that he objecte to the reaing of the instrument sue on, because it isclose no cause of action against him; this objection being overrule an the instrument amitte as evience, the proof on behalf of Owen, was, that he ha a lien on Foster’s crop of cotton, an was to have the shipping of it, an when he accepte the orer in question, he expecte to pay it, after eucting what Foster owe him, out of the procees when he shoul receive the same. That Foster, without Owen’s knowlege or authority, cause the cotton to be shippe to New Orleans, by one Brooks, who receive the procees: that Brooks, afterwars, upon the eman of Owen, pai him a part only of what Foster owe him.
The court, on the motion of Lavine, instructe the jury, that the instrument sue on furnishe sufficient evience to them of inebteness without looking to any other testimony, an refuse, at the request of Owen, to instruct, that in orer to entitle the plaintiff to recover, he must prove that efenant got possession-. of the procees of the crop of cotton mentione in the raft sue on.
The raft or orer, in question, was not a bill of exchange, accoring to the law merchant; because it was rawn payable upon a contingency; that is, out of a particular fun, which the rawee might not have on han, belonging to the rawer, or which might prove""eficient in amount, an coul not be put into circulation as a negotiable instrument, payable at all events, an base on the personal creit of the rawer. So it was rule in Hamilton vs. Myrick & Williamson, 8 Ark. 541, where, apart from other questions there involve, the case may be thus state; that Hamilton mae an orer in writing upon his merchants in New Orleans, irecting- them to pay to one Poor or orer, a certain sum of money, “out of the money receive on my account from the insurance office when collecte;” an which orer Poor enorse to, Myrick, who sue Hamilton upon it, alleging that the merchants, to whom the orer was aresse, ha collecte the money in question from the Insurance Company; but that they refuse to, pay the orer, when presente to them for payment, whereupon it was proteste, an of which Hamilton ha ue notice, &c. The court there hel that uner the statutory provision, Digest 25, section 14, the term “bill of exchange,” as use in that act, shoul be so construe as to inclue “all rafts or orers, rawn by one person on another for the payment of a sum of money specifie therein,” i not mean to imply that the fun might be contingent, or to make any change in the law merchant as to the essential requisites of a bill of exchange; an so it might be questionable whether that provision woul have the effect to exten the rules applicable to bills of exchange, to checks on bankers an the like.
An in Gwin vs. Roberts, ib. 72, Roberts ha rawn an orer on Saugrain, requesting him to let one Chambevs have thirty oR lars in merchanise, out of his store; Chambers assigne the orer to Gwin, who presente it to Saugrain, an he refuse to accept or pay it. Gwin sue Roberts upon the orer, an the «court there hel that it coul not be regare as a bon, bill, promissory note, raft or orer, within the operation of the law merchant, or any statutory provision in force in this State, or assignable, so as to vest in the assignee a legal right of action against the rawer, an intimate that the plaintiff ha misconceive his remey — that is, we infer, he might have sue Chambers to recover back the consieration pai him for the assignment, an Chambers, in turn, woul have ha a like recourse upon Roberts, the rawer.
In both of those cases the orers, not being bills of exchange, an not having been accepte by the rawees, were incomplete as assignable contracts. But the statute of assignments (commente upon in Walker vs. Johnson, 13 Ark. 522), makes all bons, bills, notes, agreements an contracts in writing for the payment of money or property assignable, so as to enable any assignee to sue for the same in his own name, an so having the legal interest ’he must sue, as hel in Block vs. Walker 2 Ark. 4, followe in several cases. True, the law merchant is, to a certain extent, introuce by the 9th section of the statute concerning assignments, but the octrine of assignments, an the rules of the law merchant are essentially ifferent, as notice in Walker vs. Johnson. That section makes enorsers or assignors, upon receiving ue notice of non-payment, primarily liable to the holer of “ any instrument in writing, assignable by law for the payment of money alone.” Upon the construction of this section, cai'rying out the principle asserte by Hamilton vs. Myrick an Williamson, in regar to bills of exchange, it might be proper to hol that promissory notes, payable upon a contingency, are not negotiable accoring to the law merchant.
But that issue is not the question here. A promissory note, or any other contract in writing, though not negotiable because payable in property or upon’a contingency's nevertheless assignable, so as to vest a right of action in the assignee against the maker or obligor. That such is the law in this State has never been oubte. The broa an comprehensive terms of the first section of the statute of assignments oes away with the common law octrine of maintainance as to all the instruments in writing embrace in it. Supposing the term “bills” there use oes not mean a bill of exchange or orer, but bills single, or seale notes, as they are sometimes calle in the western States, yet accoring to the spirit of the statute, the instrument here sue upon must be regare as a contract or agreement complete by the acceptance of Owen, assignable by law, an upon which, for' any breach of it, he is liable to any holer or assignee. It oes not follow that upon such a contract the payee or enorsee coul hol the rawer, or any intermeiate assignor primarily liable upon notice of non-payment by the acceptor. But the contract here is the same in effect, as if Owen ha mae his promissory note payable to Foster, in property or upon a contingency, an Foster ha assigne it to Lavine. There is no reason for allowing the acceptor, who intene to become the principal ebtor, to repuiate the contract because of the shape in which he chose to make himself a party to it. If the instrument in question was any contract at all on the part of Owen, then accoring to our statutory rules of practice, it importe a consieration, an the execution of it nee not be prove, unless enie by plea uner oath; so that it was properly mae the founation of the complaint, an the Circuit Court ecie correctly in amitting it to be rea as part of the plaintiff’s case before the jury. No importance is attache to the circumstance, which, however, exists in this case, that the suit, having been commence before a justice of the peace, formal pleaings are not require, an no question coul arise as to the form of the eclaration.
The opinion here expresse is irectly oppose to the ecision in Hawkins vs. Watkins, 5 Ark. 481, followe by Henry vs. Hazen, ib. 401. In the first case, leaving out of view any question as to the insufficiency of the eclaration, for counting on the instrument in form as a bill of exchange, an omitting to aver the value of Arkansas money, the court rest their ecision on the groun, that a raft payable in Arkansas money cannot be mae the basis of an action against the acceptor of it. The gist of the reasoning is a re-affirmation of that in Hamilton vs. Myrick & Williamson, an Gwin vs. Roberts, where it was right, because the orers there never were accepte, an clearly the instruments were not negotiable as at the law merchant, to charge the rawer or enorser, on notice of non-performance by the rawee. In Henry vs. Hazen, the orer was rawn by one Hutchinson on Hazen, requesting him to pay Henry a certain sum of money, “as soon as you receive the amount of my account with the government from Capt. Wm. Armstrong,” an Hazen accepte it on the conition that the account was not curtaile below his own account an notes, meaning, as may be suppose, what Hutchinson alreay owe him. The eclaration containe two counts, one on the instrument an the other for money ha an receive. The court consiere, that such an instrument, “though not vali as creating any legal liability against the parties to it, is yet competent written evience of the acceptor’s liability uner the count for money ha an receive, in connection with other proof to establish the happening of the contingency, upon which the acceptor was to pay:” an the jugment was reverse, because the court below refuse to permit the plaintifF to auce evience, uner the common count, of the state of accounts between Hazen an Hutchinson, in orer to show' that the contingency ha happene, upon which Hazen woul become liable; an this was carrying out the intimation in Hawkins vs. Watkins, that the bill there sue upon coul be mae available in another form of action as evience. So that, after all, the question was not so much as to the liability of the acceptor, but whether he coul be sue in a particular form of action. On the other han, in Hawkins vs. Watkins, it is sai that though the acceptor woul not be liable as such, upon an orer payable in property, yet a note for property woul be assignable, because the payee has a right'of action on the privity of contract.
Now we take it that if Hawkins or Hazen, in the cases referre to, were liable at all, or in any form of action, to the payees or assignees of those rafts, it was not because of any privity of contract or consieration, passing between them, but solely by virtue of the statute of assignments, an upon the written contract of acceptance. . The innovation mae upon the common law by bills of exchange, the theory of which is a transfer, by the rawer, of a sum of money which the rawee owes him, to the payee, epene solely on their negotiable character by the law merchant, an in orer to make such transfer effectual to the rawee or any remote enorsee, without any new consieration or privity of contract, between the acceptor an any holer, they must have certain requisites, unerstoo an settle by the law merchant. If A accepts B’s orer in writing, to pay C, but upon remote conition, or contingency, or for property, it oes not operate as a bill of exchange to transfer any right to C, to eman the money or property of A. So, since the statute of Anne, a note for property, or for money, payable upon a contingency, woul not be a promissory note having any negotiable qualities, but only a parol contract in writing, which oes not import a consieration, an coul not be the founation of an action. But when, by the statute, all contracts in writing for money or property import a consieration, an are the founation of the action, an are mae assignable at law as in equity, no istinction is perceive between the contract of an acceptor an the maker of a bon or note for property or payable on a contingency. In either case the liability of the maker or acceptor, oes not epen upon the law merchant, an it woul be singular if it i. Such instruments are not commercial paper, an no question can arise as to the liability of the rawer or enorser, on notice of nonpayment. But the maker or acceptor having boun himself by a vali contract in writing, just such right of action as the payee or obligee has on the instrument, may be transferre by the assignment to any thir person, though he be an entire stranger to the original consieration.
The soli objection to the policy of the whole octrine of assignments, as regulate by statute, an an entire innovation upon the common law, is that it opens up controversies between the assignee an the obligor or promissor, respecting his equities as against the obligee an assignor, growing out of transactions to which the assignee is a stranger, an in a suit to which the assignor is not a party; an where the obligation itself is contingent or conitional, a variety of what may be terme collateral issues, are liable to spring up. Thus in Henry vs. Hazen, the court appear to have ha no hesitation in allowing Henry to go into proof of complicate transactions between Hutchinson an Hazen, the rawer an acceptor of a raft payable on certain contingencies, in orer to show that they ha happene. As to that part of the ecision there, we must conclue that if Hazen was liable on these transactions to a stranger, it was by virtue of his written contract, which the statute mae assignable.
It follows that the court below erre in instructing the jury, that the instrument sue on affore sufficient evience of inebteness, without looking to any other testimony. The plaintiff coul only recover by proving, an in a formal eclaration he woul have so to aver, that the efenant ha receive the procees of the crop of cotton in question to an amount sufficient to pay the raft. But for the contingency of the fun the instrument woul be a regular bill of exchange, an upon the facts proven the plaintiff was clearly not entitle to recover.
For this error the jugment will be reverse, an the cause remane for farther proceeings.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
Owen an Norris execute their writing obligatory to John H. Cornish, as guarian of Virginia E. Tobin, who, by his written enorsement thereon, assigne it to Gentry, the plaintiff. The efence set up by the plea is, that before the assignment by Cornish to Gentry, Cornish ha cease to be guarian, an that Ewar P. Tatum was, at the time the assignment was mae, an continue to be the guarian of sai minor, an as such ha, at the time of the assignment of the bon to the plaintiff, an yet has the legal right of action in sai bon.
Upon emurrer to the plea this efence was hel by the Circuit Court goo, an upon exceptions to the ecision of the Circuit Court, its legal sufficiency'is presente for our consieration.
The authorities, cite to show that when an aministrator is remove, his successor in aministration (the aministrator e lonis non), succees by operation of law to the legal rights of his preecessor in office, sustains the argument of counsel in regar to such rights as vest in the aministrator, alone by operation of law; as for instance, where a note or bon is execute to his intestate an comes to the han of the aministrator as assets. The right of action woul, in such case, vest in him by operation of law, in virtue of his office, an if remaining in his hans unaministere upon until isplace, woul, in like manner, pass to an vest in his successor in office. But where the contract (as in this instance) is mae after aministration with the aministrator, (although in regai- to a subject matter properly assets in his hans), he acquires a legal right in the chose in action by contract, annot by operation of law. For this reason ithas been hel by this court, that where a note or bon is mae payable to an aministrator, as such, he may at his election sue upon it in either his iniviual or his representative right, (Hemphill vs. Hamilton, 11 Ark. 425), an in case the suit shoul be Commence by the first aministrator in his iniviual right, the action coul not be revive an continue in the name of his successor, the aministrator e lonis non. So that, amitting the strictest analogy to exist between the legal rights an power of aministrators an guarians, as the bon in this case was execute to Cornish as guarian, he by his assignment to the plaintiff electe to treat an hol it as a ebt ue to him in his iniviual right, as fully as if he ha himself sue upon it in such right.
But counsel seem to have overlooke the marke ifference which exists between aministrators an guarians in respect to the source an extent of their respective powers an uties. It is by operation of law that aministrators represent the intestate himself, succee to his lights an,-to the extent of assets, to his-liabilities. But the guarian oes not succee to the legal rights of the war; by virtue of his guarianship he becomes the author-' ize agent of the minor to protect his person, an to take care of an manage his property, the legal title to which is not in him but in his war, an in whose name contracts are mae, an suits touching his rights are prosecute. Upon a change of guarians the property, the legal title in which still remains in the war, passes to the new guarian, whose rights an uties are co-extensive with his preecessors.
But as respects choses in action, execute to the guarian in consieration of the loan of money, hire of slaves, rents, &c., the-contract having been mae with him, he is thereby investe with the legal-right to the chose in action, which he may well pass to another by assignment, or he may turn it over to his successor as-part of his wars’ estate, who may, at his option, accept it as such, but in that event, we apprehen that, shoul the new guarian sue upon such bon, unless assigne to him, suit shoul be-brought in the name of the first guarian, in whom the legal title; woul still exist. Thus, in the case of Pon vs. Curtis, 7 Wen. 45, where a covenant for the payment of rent was taken to the* guarian, whilst his war was a minor, it was contene that suit-shoul have been brought in the name of the war, he having, 'arrive at mature age before the suit was commence, it was hel that the suit v;as well brought in the name of the guarian.
From the view thus taken of the case, it follows that the plea-was clearly insufficient, an that the Circuit Court erre in overruling the plaintiff’s emurrer to it. Let the jugment be reverse, an the cause remane for further proceeings therein,, to be ha accoring to law.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The appellants, in right of the petitioner, Ann Welch, file their petition to the Union Probate Court against the aministrators an heirs at law of Joseph Rhem, ecease, for ower in the estate of sai ecease.
It is allege that the estate consists of lans, slaves, an personal estate, now in the aministrator’s hans, an also a large amount of money, arising from the hire of the slaves, in all of which she claims ower. That the estate is solvent, an uner the statute, she is entitle to receive, out of the goos an chattels of the estate, over an above her ower, the sum of $ 150, at the appraise value thereof; an prays that the aministrators be mae to account an that ower be assigne her.
The aministrators answer, to which a special replication is file, by which issue is taken to so much of the efenant’s answer as enies the right of the petitioners to ower in the slave Cato, name in the petition, an to so much of the answer as relates to the hiring of the slaves, an the sum for which the aministrators shoul account.
The case was trie upon petition an answer.
Upon the hearing of the case, the Probate Court refuse to allow the wiow ower in the slave Cato; an also refuse to charge the aministrators with such an amount of hire as petitioners thought themselves entitle to receive.
From the ecision an jugment of the Probate Court the petitioners appeale to the Circuit Court, where the jugment of the Probate Court was affirme. The exceptions taken before the Probate Court present the only questions for our consieration'. They relate alone to the right to ower in the slave Cato, an in respect to the hire of the slaves. The efenants amit that Cato was one of the slaves inventorie, an hel by them for a time as part of their intestate’s estate; but set up in avoiance or excuse for not accounting for the slave, that by an orer of the Probate Court, he was ischarge from their custoy!. If such was really the case, an if the Probate Court ha power to orer such ischarge, as this was affirmative matter, with regar to which the efenants’ answer coul not be receive as evience, (See Scott, White & Co. vs. Henry & Cunningham, 13 Ark. Rep. 121,) the efenants shoul have introuce the recor, or other competent evience to prove that fact. As this appears not to have been one, that slave stoo in the same situation that the other slaves i, an shoul have been taken into account in ecreeing ower. The efenants i not attempt to' account for the hire of the slaves; inee, they assume that they were, uner the circumstances, not boun to account for hire. They amit that the slaves belong to the estate an were hel an controlle by them, but state that the slaves were most of the time, kept upon the intestate’s farm at work, an that they accounte for the procees of their labor in their settlement with the court; that they were inuce to pursue this course, because it ha been pursue by their preecessors in aministration, an because they were so requeste to act by the wiow, (the claimant for ower.)
It was certainly the uty of the aministrator to put the slaves to labor at public or private hire, whether so orere by the Probate Court or not; or, whether hire or not, they were at all events accountable for the reasonable value of the services of the slaves. The procees of the labor of the slaves, whether employe on a farm or otherwise, is not the measure of the1 amin-tors’ accountability, but the orinary value of the services of tbe slaves at hire. This Is the only safe stanar of accountability easily to be arrive at by putting slaves to public hire upon notice, or by proving the rate of hire for such slaves at a given time. The procees of the labor of the slaves is so epenent upon the Mn of labor to which they were put, their management, the value of prouce, an like consierations, as to rener it extremely ifficult to arrive at any just estimate of the sum so realize, an is unwarrante by the’ nature of the trust repose in the aministrators. If (as allege) the wiow i sanction an irect the course pursue by the aministrators, so far as they pursue such irection, they may be protecte, as against her claim to ower, to a stricter account. But of this there is no evience ; nor is there any evience of the amount realize from the labor of the slaves. Reference is mae in efenants’ answer to a settlement mae with the court, in which they charge themselves with the sum so receive, but such settlement is not mae an exhibit, nor is it to be foun in this recor ; nor is there evience here to be foun sufficient to take an account for hire, or to assign ower except as to the slaves.
The Circuit Court shoul have sustaine the exception taken by the petitioners in the Probate Court, an have proceee to try the case e novo. Upon such trial all the evience which might legally have been introuce in the Probate Court upon the hearing of their cause there, woul have been alike amissible upon the trial e novo in the Circuit Court, so as to enable the court upon such trial to rener a final ecree accoring to the rights of the parties upon the facts presente.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The appellants exhibite their bill in the court below against the State an the Bank of the State of Arkansas, the object of which was to enjoin a jugment at law renere against them in favor of the Bank. The questions involve may be consiere as epening upon the sufficiency of the bill, the substantial allegations of which are as follows : That on the first of September, 1843, one John Clark, as principal, .an the complainants, as his securities, execute their promissory note to the Bank of the State of Arkansas, which was iscounte by the principal bank at Little Rock, for the benefit of Clark, an became ue twelve months after ate. That Clark eparte this life, on the first ay of January, 1845, leaving the note wholly unpai, an his estate insolvent; that Clark, at the time of his eath, was a member of the State Senate, an in attenance upon the Legislature, then in session at Little Rock ; an there was ue to him, from the State, a sum of money for his pay an mileage as a member of the Senate, an for his services as commissioner employe by the State in running a bounary line, more than sufficient to pay the note in question. That the State ha the entire beneficial interest in the note an was really the owner an holer of it, an on the fourth of January, 1845, the complainants, by a notice in writing, aresse to the Auitor of Public Accounts, notifie the State that she woul be require to appropriate the moneys so in han belonging to the estate of Clark, to the payment of the-note, an warning the Auitor to retain a sufficiency of such moneys for that purpose; that the State isregare the notice, an on the 9th of January in the same year, the General Assembly enacte that one Wilfre Garner be authorize to receive such moneys ue from the State to Clark, an an after efraying all expenses incurre by him uring that session of the Legislature, to pay over the resiue,if any, to such aministrator upon Clafrk’s estate, as might be thereafter appointe, an in pursuance of this act, Garner, an entire stranger to the estate, receive from the Treasury the money owing from the State to Clark. That the Bank ha subsequently obtaine jugment against the complainants, for the amount ue upon the note; the execution of which jugment they praye might be perpetually enjoine.
Upon the case mae by the bill, our opinion is, that the relief sought was properly enie. The position contene for the complainants is, that as the State owne the Bank, an ha full control over it, as a public corporation, the note of Clark an his securities to the Bank was really a ebt ue to the State, an they argue that in such case, it woul be within the scope of the Auitor’s uty an authority to arrest the payment of any money, that might be ue from the State to Clark, or so much of it as woul be sufficient to satisfy a eman which the State ha against him. It will not be necessary to ecie whether the complainants woul have the right to require of the Auitor to pursue this course, for their protection as Clark’s securities, upon a ebt ue to the State, or whether by his failure to o so, they woul become release. The ebt of Clark an his securities, ■the collection of which they seek to enjoin, was incurre to the Bank. It is true the State owns the Bank, but equally true, as shown by all the legislation concerning it, since the first liquiation act passe at the session of 1842, an by the public history of the country, that the Bank is insolvent. Her assests then constitute a trust fun for the payment of her ebts, an without violating the obligation of contracts entere into by the Bank, there is no moe by which that fun coul be iverte, so as to eprive her creitors of the right to resort to it. This octrine is peculiarly applicable to the State Bank, because, unless her assets became plege as a fun for the reemption of her liabilities, it woul be ifficult to maintain that her issues for circulation, as contemplate by the charter, were not bills of creit, an therefore obnoxious to the feeral constitution. If it be suppose to follow from the opinion of this court in the case of The State et al. vs. Curran, 1 Eng. 321, that the State coul be require, in preference to any creitor of the corporation, to appropriate so much of her assets, .consisting of the note of Clark an his securities, as woul ischarge a ebt owing from the State to Clark, we o not assent to any such conclusion.
Unless the State were at the same time the ebtor an creitor of Clark, the act of the General Assembly referre to in the bill authorizing Garner to raw from the Treasury the moneys ue to Clark, can be no cause of complaint by this proceeing. It might be argue that the act in question was a violation of the right of the creitors of Clark, which ha become veste uner' the general laws in force at the time of his eath, to have his estate aministere an istribute in ue course of law, an it-might moreover be objectionable as a usurpation of power, insomuch as it contemplate that Garner, no matter how honestly exercising his iscretion, shoul appropriate the money so receive, to the payment of Clark’s ebts without any juicial ascertainment of them; yet if this be so, the only consequence woul be, that even if Garner, by rawing the money from the Treasury an thus intermeling with the estate, i not rener himself' liable to the creitors, as executor in his own wrong, still he was liable for all the money so rawn from the Treasury to the aministrator who might be appointe upon Clark’s estate. Supposing then the complainants to be creitors of the estate of Clark, by having pai any ebt of his, for which they were securities, they woul have the right, in common with the other creitors, an accoring to the classifications fixe by law, to a istributive share of the assets, incluing the money rawn from the Treasury by Garner.
In any view of the case, we think the ecree ought to be affirme.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The original bill' in this cause was exhibite by one Lamburton an Anne, his wife, she being one of the heirs at law of John Saffol, against the other heirs at law, for an account an partition of his estate. Among the efenants to this bill were the appellant John J. Saffol, against whom an orer of publication was taken as a non-resient efenant, an the appellee, James F. Saffol. Pening this suit, James F. Saffol exhibite his cross bill against the complainants an his co-efenants to the original bill, incluing the appellant. The cross bill .praye for an account an partition in respect-of the subject matter of the original bill, an the .particular relief sought by it, as against the appellant, was base upon the allegation that he, by one Tapley II. Stewart, his attorney in fact, ha sol an conveye all his interest an claim as one of the heirs, in the estate of John Saffol, to certain persons, who ha in turn sol an conveye the same interest to the appellee an John F. Saffol, another of the parties to the suit. One of the objects, an so far as the appellant is concerne, the main object of the cross bill, was to ivest him of his entire portion of the estate, an cause it to become veste by the ecree of the court in the appellee an John F. Saffol.-
An orer of publication was taken upon the cross bill against the appellant, as a non-resient efenant, an he failing to appear, a ecree pro confesso was entere, an upon the final hearing of both suits, a ecree was renere against him in accorance with the prayer of the cross bill.
The appellant, acquiescing in the ecree for partition uner the original bill, has appeale from the ecree upon the cross bill, affecting his rights.
It will only be necessary to notice one of the matters assigne for error in the proceeings ha against the appellant upon the cross bill, which is, that they were ha without any sufficientor lawful notice to him of the penency of the suit. lie contens that the notice was insufficient, because the affiavit of the non-resience, which the statute requires to be mae by-the complainant, or some other person for him, in orer for service of notice to be ha by publication, i not state that the -appellant was a non-resient, but only that the affiant believe he was; that the orer mae for publication against the appellant, pro-, fessing to statejhe nature of the complaint in general terms as require by the statute, set forth that “ the object an nature of the cross bill is to obtain a iscovery an account to be taken between the complainants an the efenants thereto, relative to the lans an slaves, goos, chattels, money, creits an effects which were of John Saffol, ecease, the hire, rents, issues, an profits thereof, an to obtain partition of sai lans an slaves, an istribution of the personal estate of the ecease,” but was silent as to the most material object of the cross bill so far as it affecte the rights of the appellant, namely, to exclue him from partition, an by virtue of the allege conveyances to ivest him of all interest in the estate to which he was an heir. An lastly, it is objecte'for the appellant, that the evience of publication, when returne an file, purports to be verifie by the affiavit of the eitor instea of the “printer or publisher” of the newspaper, as provie by the statute in such case.
Upon inspection of the recor these objections appear to be well taken in point of fact, an ahering to the opinions in Broie vs. Skelton, 6 Eng. 129 an Clark vs. Strong, 13 Ark. 491, the conclusion is inevitable that they are well foune in law.
The revise statutes of 1839, require the publication of notice to non-resient efenants, of the penency of the suit, to state fully the substance of the allegations an prayer of the bill, an this notice ha to be publishe for eight weeks successively.
By the act of 1843, it is only necessary to state the nature of the complaint in general terms ; an the act of 1845 shortens the time of publication to two weeks in succession. We must suppose that the policy which influence these changes in the statute, was to lessen the expense of legal proceeings an not to eprive the absent efenant of any safeguar for the ue protection of his rights. It therefore affors no color of license to the courts to epart from the practice requiring that all the steps by means of which the complainant may charge a non-resient efenant upon constructive notice, be substantially complie with. The nature of the complaint upon the cross bill in this case is not sufficiently state to comply with the spirit of the statute. So the affiavit of. the printer or publisher is require, or in lieu of that, the prouction of the papers containing the avertisement. The affiavit of the eitor, in any given case may be true in fact, but the law, which must prescribe general rules, oes not authorize the authentication by an eitor, who may be an often is a person not concerne in the printing or publishing of the paper.
Without passing upon any other question sought to be raise by the assignment of errors, the ecree upon the cross bill, from which the appellant has appeale, will be reverse, an upon the remaning of the cause for any further proceeings, that maybe ha upon this branch of it, he will be consiere in court as if uly serve with process, with leave to emur, plea or answer to the cross bill.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The plaintiffs in error being sue by the Bank, upon a note which they ha mae payable to her, interpose a plea, setting up certain matters in abatement. The plea, on motion of the plaintiff below, was stricken from the files, to which the efenants excepte, an suffere final jugment.
Inasmuch as the plea, re-instate upon the recor by the bill of exceptions, appears to be applicable to the action, an, for aught that appears, pleae in apt time, goo in form, signe by counsel an verifie by affiavit; in short, having all the formal requisites of a plea, our opinion is, that it ought to have been emurre to, if the plaintiff below woul question its legal sufficiency. This point was expressly rule in Sillivant vs. Rearon, 5 Ark. 140, followe by Wilson vs. Shannon, 1 Eng. 198. In Pope vs. Tunstall, 2 Ark. 209, the question of practice was waive, because the court thought the plea which ha been stricken out in that case, was goo in substance as well as form, an therefore felt at liberty to consier the case in the same light as if the pleaings ha come up on emurrer. But the case last referre to cannot be safely followe as a preceent, because the refusal of the court in any case that might come before it, to consier the legal,sufficiency of a plea, which ha been improperly stricken out on motion, woul be an implie ecision against its legal sufficiency; whereas, accoring to the establishe rules of pleaing, the proper moe of tenering an issue in law is by emurrer; an without breaking own those rules the emurrant cannot evae it by an informal motion, so as to eprive the efenant of all benefit of any question of law upon the legal sufficiency of the plea, unless he shall get it again upon the recor by bill of exceptions.
True, a plea, apparently goo on its face, might well be struck from the files, because frivolous or vexatious ; as for example, where the same matter is attempte to be pleae, which the court has once ajuge insufficient, an the pleaer coul only rest upon the ecision, or plea over. But nothing of the kin is shown here. An so, like many other legal istinctions, where the lines run into one another, it might sometimes be ifficult to etermine whether a party shoul move to strike from the files, or be put to his emurrer. But accoring as one or the other may be proper, the office of a emurrer cannot be subserve by a motion.
At an early ay, Means vs. Cromwell, 1 Ark. 247, this court foun it necessary to check the practice which ha grown up, of interposing by informal motions, not traversable or tenering any issue of fact, matters in abatement, or which properly belonge to that class of efences. An without any particular examination of that or the several subsequent cases to the same purport, there can be no oufitthat the general tenency of them to iscourage such innovations in pleaing was right.

Bogy an Bonne, two of the efenants here, have pleae in bar of the w'rit of error, that at the May term, 1851, of the Jefferson Circuit Court, at which the jugment brought up by this writ for revision, was renere, the now plaintiff in error praye an appeal from the same jugment, which appeal was uly prosecute, an upon the filing of the transcript, the appeal was ockete; the appellant assigne errors, an these efenants joine therein, an such further proceeings were ha, that the appeal came on to be hear an was submitte to this court for its final ecision an ajuication therein. The plaintiff emurs because the plea fails to show that the appeal is still pening an unetermine, or that it has been prosecute to final jugment in this^ court.
The ecision at July term, 1853, granting the motion of the appellant in the cause referre to by the plea, for leave to is- . miss the appeal after submission, seems to be also ecisive of the question here presente. We are content to say that the right of an appellant to ismiss, at his own costs, an appeal in a common law case, an sue out a writ of error to the same jugment, oes not epen upon the enquiry, whether the appeal was actually pening in.this court, or whether being so pening it ha been prosecute own to submission. We take the istinction to be between those cases where the appeal oes not operate as a superseeas, an those, on the other han, where by operation of law or the act of the suitor, by entering into recognizance, the execution is staye upon the granting of the appeal to this courti If the successful party in the court below, is not hinere by the appeal from having execution, no goo reason is perceive why* the appellant may not ismiss his appeal, at any time before the final ajuication of it, with like effect, as if he ha brought the cause here for revision by writ of error, without superseeas. As the plea fails to show that by the original appeal, the execution of the jugment became suspene, it is not sufficient to bar the present writ of error. The penency of the appeal at the time of suing out the writ of error, might be goo in abatement of the latter proceeing, but woul not be appropriately mae in bar.
In Clay vs. Notrebe, 6 Eng. 631, this court went so far as to refuse to abate a writ of error, upon a plea that an appeal ha been taken in the court below with stay of execution in the same cause. Though the ecision there turne upon the issue mae by the pleaings, whether the appeal ha been in fact pening in this court, the juge elivering this opinion is constraine to think it was an immaterial issue; because where there has been a superseeas, the option of the appellant to abanon his appeal an bring error, is inconsistent with the right of the appellee, uner the statute, to have an affirmance of the jugment, unless the appeal is iligently prosecute; besies, upon appeals taken in the Circuit Court, the stay of execution oes not epen upon the opinion of any court or juge, who, in his iscretion, may think there is probable groun of error, but the suspension is eman-able at the pleasure of the appellant, upon the sole conition of his ability to furnish satisfactory security. But waiving any such consieration it is certainly a much stronger case than the present one.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The plaintiff in error, file in the office of the clerk of the Hempstea Circuit Court, his account, verifie by affiavit, of work an materials one an furnishe in the erection of certain builings for the efenant, in orer to secure a lien on the premises uner the mechanics lien law, for abalance claime to be justly ue. Subsequently, in pursuance of the statute, the plaintiff sue out a scire facias, requiring the efenant to show cause why jugment an execution shoul not be ha against the property charge with the lien. The statute makes the scire facias equivalent to a eclaration, an obviously contemplates, that the cause shall be proceee with as other suits, which the efenant may contest; an the plaintiff may be require to prove that he is entitle to the lien, an can only have jugment for the amount which he proves is justly ue him.
In this case the efenant pleae by way of set-off, that, before an at the time oí suing out the writ of scire facias, the plaintiff was an continue to be inebte to him for goos sol, work an labor, money pai, for interest, an an account state, for a larger amount than that claime by the writ of scire facias; an also, by way of set-off, that, before the issuance of the scire facias, there ha been assigne to the efenant a certain writing obligatory, escribe in the plea, which the plaintiff ha execute to George W. Green, the amount of which thereby became ue an remaine wholly unpai with interest, from the plaintiff to the efenant. The plaintiff resting upon the overruling oí his emurrer to these pleas, the efenant ha final jugment.
The point which seems to be mae for the plaintiff is, that the pleas shoul not have been to the action of the scire facias, but shoul have been to the account an affiavit, the effect of which might have been to efeat, in this suit, the set-off pleae. Because the pleas, having relation to the state of the mutual inebteness of the parties at the time the suit was institute, if the filing of the account an affiavit is to be regare as the institution of the suit, no after acquire emans coul be available to the efenant by way of set-off.
It is clear from the statute that the filing of the account an affiavit, or laying the lien, as it is calle; is notthe institution of any suit, but is a preliminary step, by which the mechanic or material man may secure a lien, provie he follow it up by suit, that is, by scire facias, or bill in chancery, within a year; an then, the jugment he obtains in such suit, has relation back to the time of filing the account an affiavit. There can be no injustice to the plaintiff in holing, accoring to the orinary rules of pleaing, that a plea in such case is goo, which sets up a cross eman, in other respects properly the subject of set-off, subsisting at the time' of the commencement of the suit, which is the issuance of the scire facias.
At the same time, the remey, as regulate by statute, is a peculiar one, an is of an equitable character. The person claiming a lien is require to file a just an true account of the work one, &c., showing the amount really ue him after all just creits are given. It is for this balance that the plaintiff emans jugment in the scire facias. An it might turn out that the cross emans set up by the plea, are in whole or in part, those for which the claimant ha alreay given creit in his account originally file uner oath. It may be, the emurrer was preicate upon the iea that for this reason, the efenant ought, in fairness, to plea to the entire claim as set forth in the account, an not to the scire facias, which only claims the balance. An in such case a question might, arise, as in Burr vs. Byers, 5 Eng. 398, whether, if the plaintiff is boun to prove his whole account an failing as to part, the efenant, making no proof, can have the benefit of the creits amitte on the face of the-account.
But we apprehen that any question of that kin woul not. affect the legal sufficiency of the pleas. The statute gives the claimant the benefit of a lien by his complying with certain conitions, one of which is, that he shall state all just creits in his account. His act in laying the lien is ex parte, an not at all conclusive on the efenant. The intent of the statute woul seem to be that, at the trial on the scire facias, the plaintiff shoul go into proof.of his whole account, which, though verifie by'the oath of. one of the parties, oes not thereby become evience for either party. Though the plaintiff may not be entitle to recover more than the balance claime - with interest, the enquiry is now merely one of.inebteness as in<an orinary suit.. If the plaintiff establishes his account an the efenant relies on payment or offset, he must prove them as any other affirmative pleas, an by the orinary channels of evience. If he chooses to rely on the creits given in the account, the whole account,, charges as well as creits, ought, perhaps, to be taken as one entire amission; an if the efenant relies upon a set-off, or claims creits, in aition to those given in the account, the court or jury trying the issues, must etermine from the efenant’s bill of particulars an the proofs, whether they are the same items for which the plaintiff has alreay given creit, so that, in the language of the statute, the verict shall be “for such sum as shall be foun to be ue.
Upon the sufficiency of the pleas, as they stan confesse by the emurrer, the jugment of the court below is right an must be affirme.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court!
This w'as an action of assumpsit upon open account, to which the efenant pleae non-assumpsit an set-off. The bills of particulars on either sie consiste of various items, which were sought to be establishe by proof. No objection was mae to the introuction of evience, an the cause was submitte without instructions to the jury, who foun a balance of account in favor of the plaintiff below. The efenant move for a new trial, because the verict was contrary to evience, an upon the groun of newly iscovere testimony. The motion being overrule, he excepte to the ecision of the court an took a bill of exceptions, setting out the evience. From this it oes appear that the efenant auce testimony conucing to prove a a larger amount of off-set than was allowe him by the verict of the jury. But the istinction is to be taken between cases where this court will venture to set asie a verict, because it is without evience as to some material fact necessary to uphol it, an cases like the present, where the verict is objecte to merely because it is against evience. The principal item of his account, which the efenant here attempte to prove, an which the jury woul seem to have rejecte, was for a quantity of corn, which the plaintiff ha taken an sol from the plantation of the efenant. But it is inferable from the testimony, though conveye to this court through the unsatisfactory meium of a bill of exceptions, that this was corn which the plaintiff himself, ha raise upon a plantation of the efenant, an therefore, might have ha a right to ispose of as his own. The presumption is to be inulge that if the verict was grossly unjust to either party, because against the weight of evience, the juge who presie at the trial, woul not have refuse to exercise his iscretion to set it asie. But surely upon the verict an the concurring refusal of the court below to isturb it, every possible presumption ought to be ha in favor of its correctness. Else this court woul be assuming the power it has not, to ictate to juries that they must believe evience against their own convictions of its truth.
The efenant, in his affiavit, state that he ha iscovere, since the trial, that he coul prove by an absent witness, the payment of a certain sum of money to the plaintiff, not long before the commencement of the suit. The witness was then resiing in the county. Besies the want of iligence inicate by the tenor of the affiavit, there are various objections to its sufficiency. No such item is charge in the efenant’s bill of particulars, as that to which the newly iscovere testimony woul apply. If the efenant ha, in fact, mae such payment, it is reasonable to suppose he woul charge it in his account, among other items of cash an merchanize. But the affiavit oes not aver that any such payment was mae except by inference, because he was informe an believe he coul prove it by the witness referre to. If the efenant were inicte on this cautious affiavit for swearing falsely, that he ha mae such payment, it is oubtful whether he coul be convicte.

It is manifest that if she takes the slaves, absolutely an in her own right, she takes the real estate in the same way, an this woul be in conflict with the policy of our statute of escents, of preserving the inheritance in the bloo of the first purchaser, subject to ower in the common law sense of that term; as to the uration of the estate.

James F. Lee brought his suit in replevin against John Row-ark, for a mule. The general issue was pleae, an by consent of parties, the case was submitte to the court sitting as a jury. After having hear the evience the court foun for the plaintiff, an as the property ha not been replevie an elivere to the plaintiff, the court also hear evience, as well touching the amages for the etention of the property as the value thereof, an renere a jugment in his favor for the same. Whereupon, the efenant move the court to grant him a new trial, because the fining of the court was contrary to law an evience; which motion the court overrule. The efenant excepte an mae the evience matter of recor by his bill of exceptions.
The questions presente an argue by counsel are, first, as to the sufficiency of the evience to sustain the fining of the court; an secon, that it was error in the court to rener an absolute jugment for the value of the property.
As regars the first question, there can be no oubt but that the evience is sufficient to uphol the fining of the court. There is no lack of evience upon any point necessary to a recovery; an although the evience of several of the witnesses is somewhat contraictory, as well with regar to the purchase of the mule by the plaintiff, as the ientity of the mule in the efenant’s possession, as the same purchase by the plaintiff, it was the peculiar province of the court sitting as a jury to weigh the evience an etermine the facts, an having one so, we o not feel at liberty to isturb the verict.
After fining the issue for the plaintiff, the court, uner the circumstances of the case, properly ascertaine the value of the mule, but faile to rener a jugment thereon, in accorance with the statute. Section 39, ch. 13G Dig., provies “that in case the plaintiff shall recover jugment upon the whole recor, he shall be entitle, in aition to jugment for amages an costs, to a further jugment, that the property be replevie an elivere to him without elay; or in efault thereof, that the plaintiff recover from the efenant the value of the property ascertaine by the court or jury. Uner the provisions of the statute, the court shoul have renere jugment that the property be replevie an elivere; as well as for the value thereof. Uner the provisions of the statute jugment, when properly renere, the efenant may surrener the property an ischarge himself from the payment of the amages: but by the jugment, as renere in this case, he is eprive of the privilege of oing so.

When this case was, upon a former occasion-, before us (see 6 Eng. Rep. 675), the 4th plea of efenant, Fowler, the legal effect of which was to eny the existence of a subsisting cause of action in the plaintiff at the time his suit was commence, was hel to be a goo plea in bar; an consequently no question can now be raise as to its legal sufficiency.
When the case was remane to the Circuit Court for further proceeings therein to be ha, the plaintiff replie to the 4th plea, matter which showe that his right to sue accrue to him at a ay subsequent to the commencement of his action. An the legal sufficiency of this replication is the sole question now' to be ecie.
If the plaintiff ha, by a general replication, traverse the efence setup in the plea, the material fact thus putin issue woul have been the penency of the appeal at the time the suit was commence. Instea of oing this, he file a special replication, by which the existence of the appeal at the time state in the efenant’s plea was amitte, an the subsequent isposal of the case in the Supreme Court was set up in avoiance of the matter pleae by the efenant. This new matter was clearly insufficient for that purpose. The question raise by the plea was, as to the existence of the plaintiff’s right of action at the time the suit was commence, an not as to whether it ha subsequently accrue. So that unless the subsequently acquire right was, in legal effect, equivalent to a pre-existing right, it was not responsive to the plea; for it is a well establishe rule that no one can sue in a court of law, wffio has not, at the time of bringing his-suit, a then existing- right of action in himself. The right of action in the plaintiff in this case accrue from an at the ate of the final ecision of the Supreme Court, affirming the ecree of the Circuit Court, an whether the pre-existing isabilty to sue shoul be consiere as matter in bar or abatement, although the jugments upon these pleas are, in several respects, ifferent; that in bar being conclusive upon the parties, upon all pre-existing matters at issue; that in abatement, where a temporary isability is pleae, that the plant remain without ay, &c. In this case the efence was that the right of action at the time the suit w'as brought, ha not accrue. The jugment, then, upon the plea in bar, although conclusive upon their existing rights, coul not be pleae in bar of a subsequently acquire right of a„ction. So that, so far as the rights of the parties are concerne, it woul be as-harmless as the jugment upon a plea in abatement woul.
Suppose suit ha been brought upon the injunction bon before the ecree in the Circuit Court. It is very clear, accoring to the ecision of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, that no action coul be maintaine upon the bon, an as was the case there, that this matter coul be pleae in bar. Cates &c., vs. Woolrige, 1 J. J. Marsh. Rep. 268. In that case, as in this, suit was brought upon an injunction bon an a plea in bar interpose. In reference to this efence, the court sai, “ If the emurrer coul be consiere as applicable to the plea, enying the issolution of the injunction, as allege in the eclaration, we shoul not hesitate to reverse the ecision of the court below, in sustaining the emurrer, for the plea is unquestionably goo. No cause of action coul accrue on the injunction bon until the injunction was ischarge or issolve.” But although no action coul be maintaine, an although it was also hel that a plea in bar was properly interpose, no one vvoul conten that the jugment renere upon such plea, however conclusive upon any then existing cause of action, coul be plea in bar to a suit upon a subsequently accruing right of action, or, as in the cáse of Barry vs. Long, 9 Ala. Rep. 785, if suit shoul be brought upon a contract before it fell ue, it coul never be, that jugment upon the issue forme coul be pleae in bar of a recovery on such contract after it ha mature. The case of Barry vs. Long, was assumpsit, where the general issue ha been pleae. The court, in that case, hel that the fact that the contract upon which, the suit was brought ha not mature, nee not be pleae in abatement, but might be given in evience uner the general issue. So that, in any point of view in which this case presents itself, it is a matter of form, rather than substance, whether the matter of efence be pleae in bar or abatement; an the replication of the plaintiff woul have fallen as far short of a sufficient response to the plea in the one case as in the other.
In conclusion, we will remark that we have been le by the argument of the plaintiff’s counsel, into a fuller investigation of the manner of reaching efects of this kin, an of the jugment to be renere on the issues, whether in bar or abatement, than the precise point at issue might seem to require.

The appellant, Brock, who was the plaintiff below, sue the efenant in trespass for breaking an entering his close, an taking therefrom a quantity of cor-woo; to which the efenant pleae not guilty.
The facts proven, as shown by the bill of exceptions, were, that in the year 1849, the efenant cut fifly cors of woo on the lan mentione in the eclaration, while the same was public lan belonging to the Unite States. In the month of June, 1850, the plaintiff entere, or purchase the lan in question from the Unite States, an it became his private property; but the only evience, introuce by the plaintiff to show title in himself, was the certificate of the Register of the lan office, that he ha entere an locate the same by virtue of a Choctaw certificate, an also the Receiver’s reeeipt for the amount of money pai in by the plaintiff for the purchase of the excess of lan over an above the number of acres calle for by the Choctaw certificate. To the’introuction of which evience, it being at the same time ami'te that the plaintiff never ha been in possession of the lan, the efenant objecte, upon the groun that trespass coul not be maintaine. It further appeare that, at the time the plaintiff purchase the lan, the cor-woo referre to was •still upon it, not having been remove, an shortly afterwars he gave the efenant notice that the lan was his, an not to to remove the woo from it. Notwithstaning such notification the efenant went upon the lan, carrie off the cor-woo an sol it. Woo staning in the tree was worth ten cents per cor, but when cut into cor-woo an after being haule to the river, was worth one ollar an fifty cents per cor.
Each party aske for instructions : the plaintiff insisting that, upon the facts state he was entitle to maintain the action, an recover of the efenant uner the statute, three times the value of the woo carrie off: an it was insiste on behalf of the efenant, that if he was liable it was only for the value of the timber in the tree, an not for its increase value after it was cut into cor-woo. The court charge the jury, that if Smith cut the woo upon Government lan, an after the woo was cut, an before the same was remove, Brock purchase the lan from the Government, the right of the woo was in Smith, an he was not guilty of a trespass in taking it off. The jury being so instructe foun for the efenant.
It is argue for the plaintiff that the opinion in Floy vs. Ricks, ecie at July term, 1853, etermines all the questions presente on this recor. An it is argue for the efenant that by virtue of the pre-emption laws an the general policy of the lan system^of the Unite States, recognize by our statutes, he ha an implie license to cut timber on the vacant public lans, an that in consequence of his labor bestowe, the woo became his by right of accession.
The legislation of this State, making improvements on the public lans assets in the hans of the aministrator, Digest p. 122, sec. 63, authorizing ejectment to be maintaine for them, with or without a right of pre-emption, ib. p. 454, sec. 3, subjecting them to execution, where the efenant is not resiing on, or cultivating the same, ib. p 498, sec. 25, is all suborinate to the primary right of soil an isposition remaining in the Feeral Government, an oes not profess to interfere with it. An this is fully amitte by the ecisions upon this subject, as affecte by those statutes. Pelham vs. Wilson, 4 Ark. 289. Hughes vs. Sloan, 3 Eng. 146. Pelham vs. Floy, 4 ib. 530. McFarlan vs. Matthis, 5 ib. 560. The case of Wilcox vs. Jackson, 13 Peters, is a controlling authority, to the effect, that the States have no power to interfere with the unqualifie right of the Unite States, to ispose of the public omain. It oes not appear that the efenant ha any settlement or improvement upon the lan in question, which woul give him any claim as a pre-e'mptor. If he ha any such claim, it was lost by his own fault or neglect in failing to comply with the terms prescribe by the acts of Congress. The fact that the Unite States mae a vali sale of the lan to the plaintiff, implies that the efenant ha no rights in the premises: an as hel in Floy vs. Ricks, he must be. regare as a trespasser. Being such, he acquire no title to the woo by accession, 2 Kent 363; nor was such a change wrought in the character of the timber by the act of the efenant, in splitting it up into cor-woo, as to make it his by conversion. Betts vs. Lee, 5 John. 38. The woo therefore continue to belong to the owner of the lan from which it ha been severe.
In Floy vs. Ricks, the facts, so far as material to the present case, were that Ricks ha an improvement on public lan an a crop growing upon it. While the crop was growing an before it was gathere, Floy purchase the lan from the Unite States. He entere upon the lan, an gathere a portion of the crop, an for thus taking it away, Ricks sue him in trespass. For aught that appeare, Ricks occupie the position of a mere intruer on the lan of another person, an his improvements, mae there without license, became attache to the freehol, an belonge to the owner of the soil. An even if he ha an implie license uner the pre-emption laws, he forfeite all right to the gratuity by neglecting to comply with the terms on which be might have obtaine it. The case therefore ha to be etermine upon general piinciples affecting all orinary transfers of lan. An though growing crops are for some purposes regare as personalty, being subject to execution against a tenant, an the sale of them as personalty, contemplating an after severance, nee not be in writing within the statute of fraus, yet they o so far partake of the nature of realty, that as between venor an venee, the sale of the lan passes the growing crop along with it, unless there be an express reservation. Though there may be some conflict in the cases, that such is the law is fully establishe by the weight of authority. An it followe that the purchaser of the lan, having become owner of the crop growing upon it, so far from being liable as a trespasser for gathering the crop, if the position of the parties on the recor ha been reverse, Floy coul have maintaine the action against Ricks for carrying off any portion of it.
But in this case when the trees were severe, though the ownership of them was not change, they became personalty. 1 Crabbe Law of Real Prop. 20, citing Bewick vs. Whitfiel, 3 P. Wms. 268, an Channon vs. Patch. 5 Barn. & Cress. 897, in which latter case the contest between lanlor an tenant, respecting certain trees which ha been felle, turne upon the ifference between timber an pollars. See also 1 Hilliar Ab. 56. An in Mooers vs. Wait, 3 Wen. 104, there was, from the facts appearing in the report, a severe application of the principle state by the court, that “when trees or anything else attache to the freehol, are unlawfully etache therefrom, the property thus wrongfully separate from the freehol becomes the persona] property of the owner of the inheritance.”
Some extreme cases are to be foun of chattels passing to the venee uner the hea of fixtures; such as manure in heaps, which has been col lecte upon the lan for agricultural purposes; so. a fencing, though the rails have been torn own ; an etache parts of machinery, occasionally use in connection with it. But there is no intimation here that the woo in question was ever esigne to be converte into a fixture, or was in any way aapte for agricultural purposes. There is no authority for holing, that chattels not attache to the freehol, an not partaking oí the nature of realty, pass by a sale of the lan to the venee.
The owner of the lan at the time of the severance, being the-owner of the cor-woo, might have maintaine trespass or tro-, ver against Smith, for taking it away or converting it to his own, use. The only remaining enquiry is, whether this plaintiff ha any special property in it, which woul enable him to maintain this action. At the common law he coul not have brought trespass, because he ha not possession of the lan. The first relaxation of this rule, an which was necessary to protect the owners of vacant lan, or wil lans, allowe trespass to be maintaine upon a constructive possession, where the plaintiff ha title. Lebetter vs. Fitzgeral, 1 Ark. 448, ever since followe in this State, though as a consequence it becomes an inirect moe of litigating the title to lan. Then as great quantities of lan were hel uner equitable titles, erive from the government, not perfecte into grants by unavoiable elay in, the emanation of patents, the statute authorize actions of ejectment an trespass to realty to be maintaine upon the evience of a receipt or certificate of purchase, issue by a lan officer of the Unite States, See Floy vs. Ricks. There can be no goo reason for holing that the plaintiff’s constructive possession of the lan, base upon an equitable title, gave him any possession of the woo, which ha been cut an lying upon it. The owner of the woo ha a constructive possession of it; bat. it is amitte that the plaintiff ha no actual possession, which woul be necessary to support the action against a mere stranger or wrongoer. The bailee of a chattel, who has a special property in it by the express or implie license of the owner, may maintain an action in respect of any injury one to it, an may protect his possession as against a wrong-oer, because, he is presume to hol possession for the owner, an is in some way accountable to him. The venor of lan woul have a reasonable-privilege of entry to remove a chattel of his, that might be upon* it at the time of sale accompanie with actual possession, but no presumption arises from the mere act of sale, that the venee, who never ha possession of the lan, woul become bailee or agent for the owner of a chattel so situate, or in any manner-boun to protect it from injury or waste one by a stranger..
The plaintiff is not entitle tio recover the value of the woo in amages. But upon the facts state, he woul be entitle to nominal amages for the wrongful an unauthorize act of the efenant in entering upon the lan for the purpose of carrying off the woo, to which he ha no claim. Upon this groun the jugment will have to be reverse an the cause remane for-proceeings in accorance with the opinion here expresse.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The efenant gave to the plaintiff a receipt in the following wors:
“ This is to certify that I hol in my possession 4 beef steei’3, belonging to Mr. Pierce B. Gracie, that he bought of Bill. Hoge an one cow an calf, this Oct. 11th, 1848.
N. E. ROBINSON.”
The account file before the justice of the peace on the 27th of June, 1851, upon which this suit was institute, is as follows :
“Newton E. Robinson,
To Pierce B. Gracie, Dr.
1848. Oct. 11, To 4 hea of beef cattle, $50 00
“ “ “ one cow an calf, 10 00
$60 00
The efenant ha jugment on the trial before the justice from which the plaintiff appeale, an the cause being trie e novo in the Circuit Court, the efenant again ha jugment in his favor. It appears from the plaintiff’s bill of exceptions, taken to the overruling of his motion for new tial, that the plaintifi’introuce a witness, who testifie that in December, 1850, he on behalf of the plaintiff emane of the efenant the cattle in question, who i not eliver the same or any part of them. He also prove by another witness the value of beef cattle an of a cow an calf, in October 1848, an in December 1850. This was the entire case mae for the plaintiff. *
This gist of the complaint was for a conversion of the cattle by the efenant. Waiving any enquiry whether the evience state be sufficient to establish a conversion; an conceing that, waiving any question whether, inasmuch as it i not appear that the efenant ha sol, or in any manner receive the procees of the cattle, so as to make him chargeable fbr money on account, the proper remey of the plaintiff was not by action of trover, the jurisiction of which appropriately belonge to the Circuit Court — the evience for the efenant, rawn out on cross-examination of the plaintiff’s witnesses concerning what passe between him an the efenant at the time of the eman, conuce to establish the following facts: That the cattle accoring to the custom of the country, were running in the range in the low lans of the Ouachita river, near which the efenant live, an it was not esigne that they shoul be kept up in any enclosure. That the efenant took charge of the cattle for the accommoation of the plaintiff, an as a mere frienly act to secure them ■to him, so that Ho:;e coul not ispose of them; that after efenant gave the receipt, there came an overflow of the Ouachita •river, which rowne an washe off a great many cattle, an the efenant lost some of his own cattle in the overflow at that time: that there was°one of the beef cattle then in the range, an which he offere to go with the witness an hunt up if he woul wait, but efenant i not offer to hunt up or eliver any of the ■other cattle.
Both of the witnesses testifie, of their own knowlege, to the fact of the overflow, an the estruction of cattle cause by it, an that many rowne carcasses were foun near where the ■ efenant live : so that it is fair to presume that both vericts were in accorance with the substantial justice of the case, an ■ought not to be isturbe.
But the objection was taken an reserve by the plaintiff, to ■the proof of any statements or eclarations mae by the efenant at the time of the eman, an all of which after their introuction he again move to exclue. Certainly there was some •o/ the conversation between the efenant an the witness, consisting of neighborhoo chat, not necessary to be etaile, that was irrelevant. The plaintiff insists that the efenant coul not, for any purpose, make evience for himself by proof of his own •eclarations, an the efenant claims the benefit of all that was one an sai between him an the witness at the time of the •eman.
In actions on the case against a bailee for negligence, the bur-then of the proof of negligence is upon the plaintiff, an if the efenant gets the benefit of his own eclaration it is uner the rule, that if a plaintiff calls for a part, the efenant is entitle to have the whole of any one conversation. Bat whenever as is usually the case in trover, it is necessary to prove a previous eman an refusal, in orer to fix the liability of the efenant, the burthen of proof evolves on him to account satisfactorily for the property if lost or he have it not reay to surrener. We apprehen that in such cases, an wherever a eman is necessary, all that passe at the time relative to the matter an what the efenant sai by way of excuse, being part of the res gestae attening the eman, is evience for as well as against him, an is amissible on cross-examination, through the jury, or court sitting as one, might well believe part an reject part, accoring to their jugment of its creibility, or accoring as any portion of the efenant’s statement might be inconsistent with other evience in the cause. Where a bailee, calle upon to prouce the chattel, unertakes to account for its loss or estruction, the amissibility of his statement by way of excuse, woul epen upon the character of the bailment an the nature of his liability. No such statement of his woul be amissible, unless it woul also be competent by way of excuse, if prove aliune. Without unertaking to istinguish between negligence an gross negligence, where tne bailment is without rewar an for the accommoation of the bailor, the statements of the bailee, excusing.his failure or qualifying his refusal to surrener the chattel, where the object of the eman is to charge him with a tortious conversion, though by no means conclusive, are yet amissible in his favor, by reason of the trust an confience implie in this species of contract. So the acts an eclarations of a gratuitous bailee, cotemporaneous with the loss of the thing baile, are always competent to exhonorate him from the imputation of frau.
In this case the efenant ha the right to raw out on cross-examination of the witness proving the eman, what was sai in response to it; the general objection mae in avance to any evience of the kin was not well taken, an as some portion of it was amissible, the motion to exclue the whole was without iscrimination was properly overrule.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The suit was here originally commence by the appellee against the appellant, to recover a balance ue on an open acccount, file before the justice, as the founation of the complaint. The efenant ha jugment in the justice’s court, an the plaintiff, Hershy, appeale to the Circuit Court. Upon tiial anew in that court, the only evience auce by the plaintiff to prove his account against the efenant, was the testimony of a witness, who state that he ha presente the account to the efenant. The account referre to containe sunry charges an creits,, showing a small balance to be ue the plaintiff. The •efenant sai the account was correct, an at the same time •state that the creits for corn, thereon entere, were not correct, an that the efenant was entitle to a creit of 24 bushels in lieu of the first creit of 15 bushels; also that he was entitle to 50 cents per bushel instea of 37£ cents, as creite for another item of 35 bushels therein containe, an the efenant, after malting a calculation of the ebits an creits in the account referre to, state to the witness that the plaintiff was justly inebte to him in a trifling amount.
The court, against the objection of the efenant, charge the jury in substance, that when a efenant files a set-off, he is boun to prove it in the same manner that a plaintiff must prove his account, on which he brings suit; an that if an account is presente to an iniviual, his amissions of its correctness are goo evience against him to prove the account, but that the party’s statements, mae in the same conversation an at the same time alleging that the other party was inebte to him above what he owe, or any other statements, mae in his own favor at the same time, cannot be introuce as evience to prove his set-off. The effect of this instruction was, to exclue from the jury all the efenant ha sai to the witness uring the same conversation beyon his amissions, that the items charge on the ebit sie of the account were correct. *
The efenant ha file an account on cross eman, by way of set-off, an orinarily, it woul be true that in such case, he must prove his set-off as affirmative matter, in the same manner that the plaintiff is require to prove his account. In that position each party becomes plaintiff, but is uner no obligation to make his aversary a witness, either by calling him to the stan, or relying uyon his statements out of court. But if the plaintiff chooses oris oblige, for the want of other evience, to resort to the amissions of the efenant, there, is no rule of law better settle, or more consonant with justice, than the one that the party who is sought to be charge by an amission, is entitle to the benefit of all that he sai by way of qualification or explanation, uring- the same conversation, relative to the business in han. The amission must be taken as a whole, an if the plaintiff proves only a part, the efenant may call for the entire conversation on cross-examination. The rule is, not that the plain-, tiff is conclue by the entire amission, but that it is competent evience for the efenant to go to the jury, who are the proper juges of its creibility, an may reject such portions if any, as appear to be inconsistent, improbable or rebutte by other circumstances in evience.
So the-plaintiff, who gives the proper creits upon his account, as every correct business man shoul eneavor to o, has the benefit of the same rule. .He can only recover such amount as he proves, an the efenant is put upon proof of his payment or set-off in avoiance; yet if he claim the benefit of any creit on the face of the account, it becomes an amission of the correctness of the entire ebit sie of the account. But the efenant woul be no more preclue by such amission, from proving that he was entitle to other an further creits, orto a greater amount than those given in the account renere, than the plaintiff woul be for from going into proof of any item which the efenant ha refuse to amit.
There was some other conflicting testimony about, the market price claime by the efenant for the corn the plaintiff ha of him. That was a question of fact for the jury,'not touche by this opinion. But clearly, the appellant was aggrieve b.y the erroneous instruction to the jury; en in reversing the jugment we must say it is to be regrette that a case like the present shoul have foun its way into the court of last resort.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of ebt upon a jugment. The plaintiff sue for the use of Freerick H. Cossitt, James M. Howar an Jno. H. Hill, partners, &c., uner the firm of “ Cossitt, Howar & Hill,” thé amount of ebt emane being $112 85. The writ of summons, which issue upon the filing of the eclaration, containe corresponing recitals. At the return term, the efenant appeare an emurre to the eclaration. The emurrer being sustaine, the plaintiff obtaine leave to file an amene eclaration, at the succeeing term, to which the cause was continue. By his amene eclaration, the plaintiff professe to sue for the use of the same persons composing the firm of “Cossitt, Howar & Hill,” except that the name of the latter was state as Ira H. Hill, an the aggregate ebt emane was $113 ■60. For these suppose variances between the writ an the amene eclaration, the efenant was allowe to file a plea in abatement of the writ. The plaintiff excepte to a ecision of the court overruling his motion-to strike out the plea, an he resting upon this exception, the efenant ha jugment.
In any view of the case, the plea ought to have been treate .as frivolous. The efenant being in court upon his emurrer, the writ of summons to bring him there ha fulfille its office. A variance between the writ an cause of action set forth in the eclaration, to which he ha appeare, was no longer available as a efence. Ole vs. Floy & Erwin, 5 Ark. 249. For aught that appears the amenments were proper to be allowe in the iscretion of the court for the furtherance of justice, of clerical misprisions in the first eclaration, an not operating to the surprise or injury of the efenant, who acquiesce in them. The amene eclaration set out the same cause of action as the former one, varying only as to an item of costs ajuge in the original suit. There being a plaintiff on the recor, having the legal title an right to sue, he was uner no obligation to isclose the name of the person for whose use the suit might have been brought. That was a precaution for the benefit of the cestui que trust, or equitable assignee of the claim, whose rights will be protecte by courts of law against any frauulent combination between the nominal plaintiff an the efenant. So, notwithstaning any misescription of the equitable assignee, the efenant might well have pleae an prove a payment to, or release by the real owner of the eman sue for; so that no substantial right of his coul be impaire by any such mistake or omission in the eclaration.
The cause will be remane with instructions to sustain the motion to strike out the plea in abatement, an that the efenant be hear, oí he have any efence to the merits.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the court.
This case was here at the January term, 1850, when it was hear, an remane for further proceeings, accoring to the principles of equity, an not inconsistent with the opinion therein elivere, the ecision of the Circuit Court having been reverse. It appeare from the transcript, that at the hearing in the Circuit Court, in June, A.D., 1846, it was agree of recor by the respective parties, that the bill an answer in the cause were to1 be taken as true without any other or further proof to substantiate them, so far as they relate to the right of the complainant to ower in the premises' in question; a portion of the answer having been previously stricken out. From the bill, an what, remaine of the answer an the accompanying exhibits of both, it appeare that, on the 2 ay of February, 1833, the petitioner was an ha been long theretofore the lawful w;fe of Robert Crittenen, since then ecease, resiing with him on the lans an tenements in question. That on that ay, the sai Robert was the legal owner in fee simple, an was seize an possesse of the sai lans an tenements, an being so seize an possesse, he conveye them, by ee in trust, without warranty, in which the petitioner i not join, to Cummins an Fowler, trustees, upon certain conitions expresse, for the benefit of Morris.
That the sai Robert, having eparte this life on the 18th of December, A. D. 1834, the lans an tenements in question were gol by the trustees, on the secon Monay in January, 1836, in accorance with the provisions of the ee in trust, to the sai Morris, “in fee simple,” as is allege in the answer. That on the 22 of that month, Morris sol, assigne, an transferre to the responent, Benjamin Johnson, all his right, title an interest in an to the same, an requeste the trustees to convey the premises to the sai responent an his heirs. That in pursuance of that request the trustees i, on the 27th of February, 1836, by their ee of that ate, convey the same to the “responent an ■his heirs forever,” an that from the last mentione ay the responent ha been, an was still in possession of the lans an tenements in question, “as the owner an proprietor thereof in fee simple.” It also appeare that Crittenen ie intestate an wholly insolvent, an that the petitioner tarrie in the premises, rent free, for a portion of the term of two years after the eath of her husban, an receive from the responent the sum of two hunre ollars, as rent for the unexpire resiue of sai term of two years, an also receive from the aministrators househol goos an other chattels, of the appraise value of one hunre an fifty ollars. The other facts that appeare nee not be state, as they relate to questions that woul arise in case only the main question shoul be foun for the petitioner.
Upon this state of facts this court ecie, as questions of law raise by facts as they then appeare, that the wiow’s right of ower in the estate left by her husban, by the territorial statute {in force from the year 1817), was suborinate to the rights of creitors. That when the estate was insolvent, the specific articles an other personal property, to the amount of $150 at the appraise value, were in commutation an satisfaction of the ower rights in the personalty. That the two years tarrying in the mansion house an the plantations thereunto belonging, of which the husban ie seize an possesse, all rent free, was in commutation an satisfaction of all ower rights in the lans an tenements or real estate of which her husban ie seize an possesse.
That the wiow was entitle to ower in lans aliene by her husban in his life time, in which she i not join, although his estate shoul be insolvent. An that a conveyance by the husban, by ee in trust to trustees, for the security an payment of a ebt, was not a mere mortgage incumbrance upon the lan «conveye, but an alienation of it. It will be seen from the foregoing facts that although it i appear the ee in trust was without a covenant of warranty, it i not appear in any way, that the only vali title, uner which all the parties claim, was an after acquire one. On the contrary, it expressly appeare on the part of the petitioner, that Robert Crittenen was the “legal owner in fee simple, an was seize an possesse” of the premises in question, an conveye them to the trustees. An on the part of the responent, (who mae his only claim of title 'from Crittenen through this ee in trust) that by the several ees mentione, the lans an tenements in question were from Crittenen conveye to him an his heirs forever. An that from the ate of the last of these ees, he ha been an was still in the possesion of the premises, “as the owner an proprietor thereof in fee simple.” An this, as we shall presently see, was in legal contemplation totally inconsistent with the existence of any after acquire title as that which the parties respectively ha-allege an amitte of recor to have been conveye an receive.
Hence the ecision of this court upon the points of law above' mentione, as having arisen in the progress of this case, not only ha no reference to any after .acquire title, but was preicate upon a state of facts which exclue the iea altogether.
After the cause ha been returne into the Circuit Court, new parties were there substitute in the stea of the responent, who ha in the meantime eparte this life, an it was again hear there upon the bill, answer, replication an exhibits, an upon an agree statement of facts signe by counsel an mae a part of the recor in the cause, the only change in the pleaings consisting of the re-instatement of so much of the answer as ha been before stricken out, an this by consent. That agreement procees as follows to wit: “By consent of the parties aforesai, the following facts are agree upon, an orere to be mae of recor in this cause, namely, ‘that on an prior to the 2 ay of February, A.D., 1833, the sai complainant was the lawful wife of the sai Robert Crittenen.’ ”

“That sai blocks 27 an 42 are embrace within the west fractional part (west of the Quapaw line), of the south-west fractional quarter of fractional section two, (south of Arkansas river), in township one north, of range twelve west.
“That sai fraction of lan, containing 65-008 acres, was entere an purchase by Roswell Beebe, from the Unite States at the District Lan Office, at Little Rock, on the 6th ay of June, A.D. 1838, an a patent certificate then issue to him therefor, upon which a patent issue from the Unite States, bearing ate the 25th ay of September, A.D. 1830, granting to sai Beebe the sai tract or fraction of lan, a copy of which patent is herewith file, marke “D,” an so referre to an mae a part hereof.

“That on the 6th ay of July, A.D. 1838, sai Roswell Beebe-execute to the mayor an alermen of Little Rock, his covenant of that ate, a copy of which is herewith file, marke “E,” an so referre to an mae a part hereof.
“That on the 1st ay of January, A.D. 1840, Roswell Beebe an Clarissa his wife, by their ee of that ate, referring to sai covenant, to the Mayor an Alermen, an pursuant thereto, release an forever quit claime to the sai Chester Ashley, sai blocks 27 an 42.
“An upon the foregoing facts, so state an agree upon, it is subrtiitte to the court here to ecie whether sai complainant is ¡entitle to ower in sai two blocks an premises (excepting the single lot aforesai), an if so, from what perio of time she is so Antitie, an in case the court shoul ecree that sai complainant is so entitle, that then it is agree, that it shall be referre to the master in chancery, to enquire an ascertain the value of the yearly rents an profits of sai premises, an the amount an value of the taxes an assessments thereon, an of repairs which were require to preserve them from ecay by tim e, an wear an tear from use an occupation, an which were necessary for the comfortable use an enjoyment of the same, by the sai Benjamin Johnson, an the present efenants since his ecease, an take an state an account thereof, from such time as the court here shall ecie her to be so entitle, to the time of taking such account, an make report thereof to this court.
That portion of the answer, which was thus by agreement reinstate, was as follows, to wit; “But this responent in no way amits that sai Chester an wife, or the. sai Robert, or any, or either of them were seize or possesse, uring the lifetime of the sai Robert, of any legal or equitable right, title or estate in or to sai blocks of lots, or any part of either, but on the contrary thereof, he is informe an so expressly, enies that they or either of them were so seize or possesse. An for other an further answer to the sai petition, this responent avers that the sai Robert Crittenen never ha, at any time uring his life, nor i any person or persons, by, from, or uner whom he claime title in or to the sai two blocks of lots, have at any time uring his life any legal or equitable right or title in or to.the same or any part thereof. But on the contrary, the title in an to the same, remaine in the government of the Unite States, nor i the sai government part with her legal or eqrfitable right or title in or to sai blocks or parcels of lan, until after the eath of the sai Robert, an that the sai Robert, who ie, in-the actual use, occupation or possession of sai two blocks of lan an premises, an claiming to be the owner thereof, an of the equity of reemption therein, subject to his ee of trust aforesai, was not, at any time uring his life, seize or possesse, nor i he ie seize or possesse of any legal or equitable estate in or to the same or any part thereof, whereunto the pretene right of owner of the sai petitioner coul attach.”
Upon this state of the case, as it is now before us, a question is mae by counsel, as to whether or not the cause up res nova. It seeming to be suppose, upon the one sie, that if it oes not, the pleaings are so narrow that there is no place for the consieration of many of the facts that have been agree upon an submitte to the jugment of the court, an consequently they must be isregare, as evience woul be that was irrelevant to any given allegation, an such of them only consiere as woul support the enial of Robert Crittenen’s seizin; there being, as contene, no allegations in the pleaings to let in proof to rebut that enial. While on the other han, it is insiste that all other questions, except as to Robert Crittenen’s title, were close when the case was in this court before, an that the facts agree upon were so state an agree solely with a view to the etermination of this only remaining question, an that if the pleaings are not broa enough to amit such of the facts as support Robert Crittenen’s title, to that extent only the pleaings ought to be consiere as enlarge by force of the agreement, but not to the extent of opening the case res nova.
If the agreement ha been less explicit than it was, that “upon the foregoing facts, so state an agree upon, it is submitte to the court here to ecie whether sai complainant is entitle to ower in the sai two blocks, &c.” an the esire en ha appeare more equitable than it seems, there woul have been more of appai’ent plausibility an fairness in this latter position. But when thus explicit; an the apparent en woul seem to be, to enable the petitioner to maintain her claim of ower upon this issue by means of a fact, which, if it ha been presente upon the etermination of one of the issues she now claims to be close, woul have utterly an peremptorily exclue her from it, woul seem to be neither plausible nor fair. Entertaining, however, ifferent views from those seeming to be entertaine by counsel, as to the issues legitimately opene by that portion of the answer that has been reinstate, an which are, in no egree, close by any previous ecision of this court in this cause, because never before entertaine here, it will be unnecessary to ecie the question thus moote. For the reason, that when it might be concee that the petitioner shoul have the fullest benefit of every fact containe in the agree statement, in any way efficacious to rebut or repel the facts shown against her, uner that portion of the answer in question, she must inevitably fall short of oing so, an hence woul fail to maintain her case.
It will be remembere that the estate of Robert Crittenen being concee to have been insolvent, his wiow’s claim to ower, in the lans alienate by him, rests essentially upon two facts: his title, in which hers inheres as a part, an his alienation of his title, in which hers thus inheres. When then it shoul be shown against any title which she might set up as his, that a vali title for the same lans ha afterwars issue to a thir person, from the primitive source of titles in this country, that fact woul be no less efficacious to ignore the suppose alienation of the title originally set up by the petitioner, than to ignore the existence of that title in the husban as set up. If, therefore, in orer to support her claim to ower thus attacke, the petitioner woul be riven to show that her husban in his lifetime, was seize by relation of that ientical new title, by reason of its having been acquire by her husban’s grantor with warranty, she woul be equally riven to show that this very new title, uner which she now makes her claim, was also alienate by her husban in his lifetime. Because, if he i not alienate it, he ie seize of it, an his estate being insolvent, she was entitle to ower in no lans of which he ie seize. If the title first set up by the petitioner ha no efficacy for Crittenen, or was overslaughe as to him by a new after-acquire one, it woul be equally so for his wiow, because her title inheres in his an is a part of it.
If Crittenen were alive an woul be riven to claim an after acquire title, his wiow, after his eath, uner like circumstances woul be riven to that also, an claiming uner that, if she shoul claim ower to lan because of its alienation, it woul be incumbent on her to show the alienation of the title she claime uner; otherwise her title to ower woul not be mae out when originally preferre, nor supporte if attacke in such -a manner, If the fact ha been otherwise, that Crittenen’s estate was solvent an his wiow mae claim to ower in the lans of which he ie seize an possesse, an it shoul be shown against such a claim of ower, that a title ha afterwars issue from the Feeral Government to a thir person, the force of that fact woul be fully repelle by a showing on the part of the wiow, that that title habeen conveye to her husban’s grantor with warranty; because in snch a case, the only material part of the groun invae, upon which her claim reste, was, that of her husban’s seizure at his eath, an consequently it woul be necessary only for her to continue to support seizin in him at his eath. But inthe case at bar this cannot avail her unless, in aition to the continue support of seizin in his lifetime, she also continues to support alienation. Both ingreients being as essential for the sup-r port of a claim of ower in the one case, as the one ingreient is in the other case.
Now, how can she continue to maintain alienation in the case at bar? Can she o so by bringing up the alienation of the ol 'title, which she has confesse to be ba an avoie by showing the subsequent acquisition of the new title by her husban in his lifetime? Can she exhibit the alienation of an ol title, which she has confesse to be no title, an abanone for a new one, because she coul no longer maintain the ol one, an claim this to be alienation of the new one, on which she is now riven to preicate her claim. Truly this is a question of “ ientity of title,” as remarke by the counsel for the petitioner in his argument, but not in the sense in which he use those terms.
Can she claim that this court has ajuicate that question, an whether right or wrong, it is now the law of this cas'e, when, as we have seen by her own allegations an amissions of recor, it was not only not presente here, but exclue by facts of recor, which, as we shall presently see more istinctly, renere it legally impossible that it coul have been involve in any question ajuicate? How then, upon this recor, can she show that the title, upon which she now grouns her claim, was aliene by her husban in his lifetime? Giving then to petitioner the full benefit of the argument urge for her, that the after acquire title was but the perfection of the ol one — in which we confess we see no force, because the ol title, as a title, was nothing an nothing has no properties — it woul still result that she must show the conveyances from her husban of the perfecte title, else the absurity woul ultimate, that the creitors of Critten-en — he having ie insolvent an seize of it — woul take the perfecte title clear of any claim of ower, an still the wiow woul be enowe of it. Certainly then, in no other way upon this recor can she maintain the allege alienation, than by exhibiting the instruments of conveyance, which have been alreay hel to have sufficient capacity to convey the suppose ol title existing as that was allege an amitte to exist from Crittenen to Johnson, not by way of mortgage incumbrance merely, but by way of absolute alienation.
An this presents a point of law, which we have now to etermine, an that is whether, previous to our statutory provision, (Dig. ch. 37, sec. 4), where one mae a conveyance of lan by ee containing no covenant of warranty, having at the time no title to the lan, a title subsequently acquire by such grantor woul enure to the benefit of the grantee.
It is evient from the numerous authorities which we have examine carefully, that a peculiar efficacy is given in the American courts to the covenant of warranty in a ee, for the transmission of an after acquire title to lan. Its absence or presence is mae almost invariably the sole test of the capacity of the ee for this purpose. The origin an growth of the octrine, now almost universally recognize, that a ee with the covenant of warranty has, an one without it has not the capacity in question, is more curious an interesting than profitable, an although we have looke into it, an woul, if necessary, be most incline to favor the theory, plausible fo us, that it is really but little akin to the octrine of estoppel, an is now resting on reasons beyon the mere prevention of circuity of action, we shall content ourselves with but the expression of our opinion, that the octrine, as we have inicate it, is fully establishe by all the better consiere opinions, when it has come in question in the American courts; an we therefore regar it as law. (See 2 Smith’s Lea. Cas. Note to Doe vs. Oliver, p. 450, an the new work of Mr. Rawle on Covenants, ch. 9, generally, an page 323, for a citation in the notes of a number of American authorities.) In the enactment of our Legislature, however, before cite, this octrine is so moifie as to place all ees, purporting to convey an estate in fee simple, or less estate, upon the same footiug; an it remains for us to etermine whether that provision, which took effect on the 20th March, 1839, can have a retroactive effect. The question has never been expressly mae an ecie in this court. In the case of Cock vs. Brogan an Thorn, (5 Ark. R. 694), the court seem to have given it a retroactive effect. There is no inication from the report of the case, that any question was mae on the point, nor oes it appear, whether the ees, to which it was applie, containe covenants of warranty or not; nor oes the court say explicitly that the title in that case passe by force of the statute: such however is strongly inferable. For aught that appears from the report of the case, all the ees in question may have containe covenants of warranty, an therefore such a construction in that case may have been, not only “accoring” to the statute, but in accorance also with the law as it stoo before, an therefore i not impair any contract, or isturb any veste right. At any rate there ceems to have been no question raise or iscusse on the point. But although this is so, we woul not lightly regar any ruling of this court if it seeme reconcilable with soun rules an principles of the law. This oes not seem to us to be so. Its inevitable effect seems to be, to take the title of lan from one an give it to another. The general rule, as to the construction of statutes, is that they “are not to be construe retrospectively, or to have a retroactive effect unless it shall clearly appear that it was so intene by the Legislature, an not even then if by such a construction the act woul ivest veste rights,” (Smith Com. Const. an St., law, p. 679, an note C, citing authorities). So Chancellor Kent says, •“The very essence of a new law is a rule for future cases.” No-va constiiutio futur isfor mam imponer e ébet et non praeteritis,” is the language of Bracton, Liber IV, p. 228. So the same author says, “A retrospective statute affecting an changing veste rights, is very generally concee in this country, as foune in unconstitutional principles, an consequently inoperative an voi,” an he as, “But this octrine is not unerstoo to apply to remeial statutes, which may be of a retrospective nature, provie they o not impair contracts, or isturb absolute veste rights, an only go to confirm rights alreay existing, an in furtherence of the remey by curing efects, an aing to the means of enforcing existing obligations.”
Uner this latter quotation, oubtless, a statute of a retrospective nature, by which we unerstan of a capacity to retroact remeially, might be uphel as constitutional, an shoul be enforce to the extent inicate, if it clearly appeare that such was the intention of the Legislature; but although it might be of a remeial an retrospective nature, it coul not be hel to act retroactively in the absence of such clear manifestation of the intention of the Legislature, without violating the general rule of construction as to retrospective operation of statutes.
There is nothing in the whole statute, of which the provision in question is a part, to show clearly that the Legislature were making rules for any other purpose than for future cases. If we were then to give this provision a retrospective action, it woul be without the clear manifestation of the intention of the Legislature, that it shoul have that effect. An even if that intention was plainly manifeste, it woul still be a ebatable question, whether or not it woul come within the constitutional sphere of retrospective statutes!
Uner such circumstances we cannot hol it retrospective, feeling boun to hol it applicable to cases only which arose after its enactment.
The ee in trust mae by Crittenen, an the conveyance uner it, being without warranty, it but remains to conclue that in our opinion the efenant was rightfully entitle to the ecree • of the court below, an it must be affirme.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
When this cause was in this court before, at the January term, A. D. 1850, several points of law were etermine, the ecree of the court reverse, an the cause sent back to be rehear with leave to both parties to take aitional testimony, (Crittenen vs. Wooruff, 6th Eng. R. 82.) After the cause ha reache the Circuit Court again, it was agree of recor between the parties, that William Russell claime to be, an was recognize as one of the original proprietors of the town, now city of Little Rock, an that as such, he claime lots No. 7,8 an 9, in Block No. 34; the same being the lots in which the appellant claims ower. That Robert Crittenen, the grantor of the appellee, hel a regular chain of title an conveyances for sai lots, through Robert C. Oen, from sai Russell to himself an that sai lots are embrace wthin the lot or south fractional part (south of the Arkansas river an west of the Quapaw line) of the northwest fractional quarter of fractional section two, in township one north of range twelve west. That sai Crittenen an sai Oen, claime to have been two of the original proprietors of Little Rock. That the covenant of Roswell Beebe to the Mayor an Alermen of the city of Little Rock, whereby he boun himself, upon the conitions expresse therein, to convey title to all persons who hel lots, by a regular chain of conveyance, from the original proprietors of the town, shoul be rea in evience. That the fraction of lan aforesai, of which the lots in controversy are § part, was grante to Roswell Beebe by the Unite States, by patent bearing ate the 25th of September, 1839, in pursuance of an entry an purchase mae by him in the Lan Office at Little Reck, on the 6th ay of June, A. D. ] 838, when a patent certifícate was issue to him upon which sai patent for the lan afterwars issue. In the chain of conveyances from the original proprietors of the town of Little Rock, Crittenen conveye to Wooruff, on the 9th of July, 1825, by ee with general warranty, uring the coverture. After the lan ha been patente to Beebe, in consieration of the improvements that Wooruff ha mae upon the lots, an of the sum of five ollars in han pai, Beebe conveye the lots to Wooruff by a ee with general warranty wherein he referre to his covenant to the Mayor an Alermen of Little Rock, an recite that he ha mae various quit claim ees uner sai covenant, an ha given ue notice to all persons intereste to apply for titles at their peril within a specifie time, an that Wooruff ha faile to apply.
The entry of Beebe, the patent to him, his covenant to the Mayor an Alermen, an his ee to Wooruff, were all subsequent to the eath of Crittenen, an regularly shown in support of the answer of Wooruff, an in accorance with the ruling of this court in this cause, when it was here before, that the venee of the husban is not estoppe from affirmatively showing a want of title in his venor. There was also a number of epositions taken after the cause ha been sent back into the Circuit Court, touching the value of the lots, the improvements, rents, an other matters not necessary to be notice; because they relate to questions that woul arise only after the main question of the right of ower shoul be hel in favor of the appellant. The cause was regularly rehear upon the petition, answers, exhibits, agree facts an evience, an the court, being of opinion against the appellant, enie her prayer an ismisse her petition, an she appeale to this court.
The wiow’s title to ower lives in her husban’s title to the lan. Until actual ameasurement by metes an bouns, it is a mere potential interest, amounting to nothing more than a chose in action, an is not subject to seizure an sale by execution. (Pennington vs. Yell, 6th Eng. R. 236, an authorities there cite.) After it is set out she has an estate in ower of which she is the tenant, holing in virtue of her husban’s title in which hers inheres an is a part. When, therefore the title of the husban is overthrown, that of his wow to ower must of necessity fall with it. When then Wooruff in this case shows that Critten ■ en ha no title to the lots in question, he necessarily show's his wiow has no title to be enowe of them, unless she can avoi this by showing that the title acquire from the Government which ignores her husban’s title, enure to him by some means as fully as if he ha been actually seize in his lifetime. In this case there is no pretence that the husban was in fact seize in his lifetime, of this after acquire title, because it issue from the Feeral Government after his eath; an none that it passe to him in point of law through the instrumentality of instruments of conveyance execute before his eath, relating to a point of time anterior to that time, because the title, since its emanation from the government, has passe into no such channel. On the contrary, it has passe irectly from Beebe to Wooruff an cannot, by mere operation of law, ascen to Wooruff as it woul have escene to Crittenen an through him to Wooruff, ha Beebe grante to some grantor of Crittenen with warranty, the latter having grante to Wooruff in 1825 by ee of this class. This title was not the mere legal title, issue by the government to unite with some equitable title against the government existing before the entry of Beebe, but the complete title to the lan, consummating the title of Beebe commencing by his entry. The entry of Beebe an the emanation of the patent to him in pursuance thereof, w’ere the beginning an ening of a complete title; an it is altogether ifferent from a case where a husban might make an entry, procure the patent certificate, assign that certificate to another, an he obtain thereby the patent in his own name.
Such facts, if shown against his wiow’s claim to ower, woul only ignore her husban’s mere nake legal title. But here a complete title is shown to have been acquire from the government, after the eath of Crittenen, which exclues any title in him in his lifetime, an the inseparable claim of his wiow to ower in virtue of it, unless she can avoi it by showing that this new title was her husban’s in his life time, either in fact or in law.
To o this she sets up the covenant of Beebe to the Mayor an Alermen, an insists that Beebe’s ee to Wooruff shoul be regare as having been mae in pursuance of that covenant,although upon its face the contrary appears.
Conceing, for the sake of the argument, that this ee shoul be so regare, the result woul not be sufficient for her, because the covenant of Beebe in no way provies for the transmission of title to Crittenen. If he ha live the title coul never have reache him, unless he ha hel uner a conveyance from Wooruff an by this means brought himself within the escription of persons provie for by the covenant, as Wooruff in fact was. An then he woul have obtaine it, not because' he ha before execute one of the instruments of conveyance' which constitute the regular chain from one of the original pro-prietors of the town of Little Rock, or because he was himself one of these proprietors, but simply because he hel lastly uner' this chain of conveyances as Wooruff i.
The covenant of Beebe in no way recognizes any rights in the-original proprietors as such, or in any grantee in any chain of conveyances from one of themfbut the moving cause of the covenant, which seems not otherwise than a gratuity on his part, seems to be to make provisions for a class of persons, who hel lots uner a suppose title, which ha proven entirely worthless. When, therefore, one erive his claim to a conveyance of title from Beebe uner his covenant, by-means of a chain of conveyance from one of the orignal proprietors, this whole chain an each of its links serve but to ientify him as the iniviual who was entitle, uner the covenant, not to receive the title of the proprietor, who forme the first link, or any of the subsequent grantors who constitute the other links, but the title of Beebe himself, which isplace all other pretene titles an recognize' none of them. These conveyances then were relatively no more meritorious in procuring the title from Beebe, than the ink an paper upon which they were written — all serving the office of but means of ientity.
An the result as to the appellant woul be the same upon the supposition, that the government ha passe her Unispute title to Beebe upon the trusts expresse in his covenant, because, in that case the only recognize equity woul be that of the holers of the lots, without any regar to its erivation, further than for purposes of ientity, the very recognition of equity in the particular class recognize, resting upon the same groun that they alone coul claim it, whereby all others were exclue from the trust in not being provie for. An Crittenen, his wiow an his heirs, being in this last category, coul not possibly claim any benefits from a trust that was not wie enough to inclue them, an by this means claim a title that that trust eclare shoul be conveye to another. In any view then, it seems clear that uner the covenant of Beebe, an consistent with it, it is not possible that the.title of Beebe coul have ever been in Crittenen, either in fact or in law, an in no other view presente to üs, have we been enable to see that Crittenen ha any interest or estate, beyon a mere possession uner an invali title, much less such an estate as that in which a right of ower woul inhere. An hence this after acquire title, thus set up an in no Way avoie, must we think, be hel to be an effectual bar to the appellant’s claim to ower in the premises.
We think therefore that the ecree of the court below ought to be affirme.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
It appears that the plaintiff by his attorney notifie the efenant, in writing, on the 6th ay of October, 1849, that on the 19th ay of that month he shoul present to the Probate Court of Pulaski county, for allowance an classification, two several claims, which he hel against the estate of his intestate, “one for three hunre an sixty 58-100 ollars, an the other for thirty 42-100 ollars,” when an where he might atten if he thought proper. xThis notice was regularly serve by the sheriff. On the 7th of February, 1851, the cause having been previously continue by both parties, a venire facias was issue on motion of both parties. The case, however, was the next ay continue by the efenant, p,n subsequently continue by consent until the 6th of February, A. D. 1852, when both parties being present, the cause came on for hearing, an on motion of the efenant the court ismisse it for want of jurisiction ; an the plaintiff, taking a bill of exceptions, appeale to the Circuit Court, where the jugment of the Probate Court was affirme; an he brought the cause here by writ of error.
Instea of making a literal copy of the bill of exceptions, the clerk has mae a reference in it to three preceing pages of the transcript, for that portion of it which he woul have otherwise transcribe again. From the whole of it, it appears that when the cause came up to be hear, the efenant move to ismiss it, because it inotappearthatthe claimha been presente to the aministrator before it was file in the Probate Court. Whereupon the plaintiff move for leave to introuce parol testimony to establish the opposite, which he was permitte to o against the objection of the efenant. From the enorsement of the clerk it appears that the claims, regularly verifie by the affiavit of tbe claimant, were file in the Probate Court on the 6th of October, 1849, being the ay of the-ateof the notice, an of the sheriff’s service of it upon the efenant, in response to which he ha long before appeare in the Probate Court. The parol evience, introuce to show a previous presentation of the claims to the efenant, was to the effect, that previous to the summer of 1849, the attorney for the claimant informe the efenant that he ha two claims, specifying the amount, to present against the estate of his intestate, an from the answer then mae, the witness inferre that the efenant woul not allow them. That afterwars, uring the summer of that year, the same witness exhibite the claims to the efenant, verifie as aforesai, by laying the same own before him upon his table, an calling his attention to them, an informing him what they were, an left them there for some space of time, an afterwars returne for them, an was then informe by the efenant that they woul not be allowe, but that he (the efenant) woul not make an enorsement upon the papers to that effect. No copy of the claim, however, was ever given to the efenant at any time, an none was ever requeste or emane by him, nor oes it appear that he gave any intimation, at the time of the allege presentation, or at any time afterwars, until the cause came up for hearing in February, 1852, that his refusal to allow the claims was in any way influence by that consieration.
The point mae in the court below an insiste upon here, is, that because the copy of the claim was not furnishe the aministrator before the proceeings were commence in the Probate Court, that court ha no jurisiction of the cause.
The case of Huson vs. Breeing, (2 Eng. R. 445,) cite by the efenant in error, is, where a jugment by efault was quashe on certiorari, because it i not affirmatively appear that the claim allowe ha been previously presente to the aministrator, an that notice ha been given him of the intene application to the Probate Court — the court refusing to make any presumption in favor of such a jugment without notice. An the case of Pennington vs. Gibson, (1 Eng. R. 447,) the other case cite by him, was also a case where there was no notice. It appeare upon the recor that the claim ha been presente for allowance an refuse, but it i not appear that the efenant ha receive notice of the intene application to the Probate Court. Besies, the octrines of these cases, as to jurisiction, have been since materially moifie by the case of Boren et al. vs. The State use &c. (6 Eng. R. 519,) an subsequent cases in this court (see also the previous case of Wilson vs. Dean (5 Eng. R. 308,) for the principle as to jurisiction, upon which the case of Broie vs. Whitfiel was overrule.)
The provision of the statute for the copy was eviently esigne to affor an executor or aministrator such information as woul enable him to act avisely, in allowing or refusing to allow a claim presente against the estate of his testator or intestate, an in case he allowe it, to place in his possession accurate ata for the list of claims he is require to keep, an for their classification an return into the Probate Court annually uner the provisions of the aministration law, (Dig. p. 128, sec. 98. In this case it appears that the orignal was not only exhibite to the aministrator, but was left in his personal custoy for some space of time after having his attention calle to it, an having been informe what it was; an that it was afterwars file in the Probate Court on the ay when he was serve with a notice by the sheriff that the claimant woul apply there for its allowance, where it remaine on file, subject to his inspection for the space of two years an four months, uring which time he was a partyto the cause in court, either continuing it himself, ormutually with the other party consenting to continuances.
Doubtless, uner the statute, an executor or aministrator is entitle to thp copy in question unless he voluntarily ispenses with it, or waives it by his own laches ; consequently for that 'cause alone he may refuse to allow a claim, or abate the proceeing in the Probate Court for a like reason; but he must interpose the objection in apt time, otherwise it cannot avail. An although in that court he may interpose it by motion, instea of by plea, because in such cases the manner of proceeing is “summary without the forms of pleaing,” (Dig. p. 129, sec. 103,) yet that oes not change the nature of the efence set up. It remains, as it is, essentially matter in abatement of the suit an must be governe as to time, &c., by the rules governing pleas in abatement, as hel in Ross et al. vs. Davis, (13 Ark. R. 294,) an in other cases in this court.
When these rules are applie to the proceeings in this case, the filing of the claim in the Probate Court, an the service of the notice upon the aministrator being taken to be equivalent to the writ an eclaration in an orinary suit at law, we think the motion was clearly out of time, an for this cause ought to have been overrule.
The jugment of the Circuit Court is therefore reverse an the cause remane to that court to be there hear e novo upon the merits.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an appeal from the justice’s court to the Circuit Court, where, upon a trial e novo, the original efenant, after amitting the plaintiff’s eman, offere to prove an account ue from the plaintiff to him, as a matter of set-off, but upon the objection, that the efenant ha not given the plaintiff proper-notice of the propose set-off, while the case was in the justice’s court, the Circuit Court rule out the propose off-set. This action of the Circuit Court is the error assigne here.
It appears from the justice’s transcript, that upon the return ay of the summons, both parties appeare before the justice, an that the efenant then file a bill of the particulars of a set-off emane by him. This appears both by an entry upon the ocket an the justice’s enorsement of filing upon the bill of particulars. The efenant afterwars, the same ay, continue the cause for a month. At the next trial ay both parties were again present, an the cause was again continue by plaintiff. At the thir trial ay, both parties were again present, an, upon the hearing, the justice rule out the off-set upon the groun, as state in his transcript, of the “efenant’s failing to give the plaintiff notice of his off-set,” an thereupon gave jugment-for the plaintiff’s eman, an the efenant appeale.
Upon the trial in the Circuit Court, the efenant amitte the correctness of the plaintiff’s eman, but insiste upon the offset, that ha been rule out by the justice, an mae aitional proof by J. B. Lewis, who seems to have acte as his attorney, before the justice, that on the original trial ay before the justice at a time when the plaintiff was present in the house an before the cause was continue, the witness notifie the justice that he ha an off-set to file in the case, rea over the items in the hearing of the plaintiff, (but i not know whether the plaintiff actually i hear him,) an then hane it to the justice to file among the papers.
The statute provies that, upon the appeal, no other cause of action shall be trie in the Circuit Court than the same that was “trie before the justice, an no set-off shall be pleae that was not pleae before the justice, if the summons was serve on the person of the efenant, (Dig. p. 670, sec. 192.) It also provies that, “In orer to entitle a efenant to set-off any eman, he must give notice thereof to the plaintiff, either verbal or written, before the jury is sworn or the trial submitte to the justice,” (Dig. p. 652, se. 81, lut misprinte 71.) “An that when a set-off is foune upon an instrument in writing execute by the plaintiff, or his testator or intestate, or iipon an open account, he must, at the time of giving such notice, file with the justice such instrument, or a bill of the items of such account,” (Dig. p. 652, sec. 82.)
Consiering together these provisions of the statute we think the Legislature, without any intention to prescribe any particular moe of communicating notice, simply esigne to secure to the plaintiff notice in fact or its equivalent, as a pre-requisite for the efenant to set up an prove an off-set. This is strongly inicate by the inefinite provision,that notice maybe given either verbally or in writing, without any other regulation except that, as to time, it must be given before the jury is sworn or the trial is submitte to a justice. Hence it woul be as well communicate inirectly as irectly; either through the instrumentality of writing, or by wor of mouth, provie actual notice be in fact carrie home from the efenant to the plaintiff. Inee, so long as the cause remaine pening an unetermine before the justice, it-woul be in accorance with the spirit of the statute for the justice to receive a set-off at any time, an if the filing, whether before or on the ay of trial, be a surprise to. the plaintiff, he might claim a continuance, but being in court he is presume to have notice.
When the testimony of Lewis is consiere in connection with what is legitimately to be inferre from the justice’s transcript, the whole taken together are equivalent, in our opinion, to proof of actual notice. Whether or not the testimony of Lewis was prouce in the justice’s court, oes not in any manner appear, but this can in no way affect the existence of the fact of notice, upon which epene the right of the efenant to be hear as to his set-off, before the justice as well as upon his appeal before the Circuit Court, where the case is hear e novo absolutely, an hot e novo upon conition that some error of fact or law may be foun as in cases of appeal from the Probate Court.
Upon the establishment in the Circuit Court of this pre-requisite to his set-off, it woul be as unreasonable to refuse to hear him as to the whole of it, as it woul be to eny him a hearing, as to some one item only, in another case where, upon a regular trial upon the merits in the justice’s court, he ha faile to make proof as to this item only, although he ha prove all the others, an was now reay to prove this also.
We think, therefore, the court erre in ruling out the off-set, an for this error the jugment ought to be reverse, an the cause remane with instructions that the Circuit Court hear the case e novo, an allow the efenant below to establish his off* set on file by sufficient evience if he can.",legal_case

The complainants, as Trustees of the Real Estate Bank, file their bill in chancery against the efenants, in the Phillips Circuit Court, upon the following state of facts.
On the 11th ay of September, 1839, the efenants execute to the Real Estate Bank of the State of Arkansas their promissory note, by which they jointly an severally promise to -pay to the Bank the sum of $2,400, for value receive. On the 2 ay of April, 1842, the Bank by ee conveye its property, incluing its ebts an choses in action, to the complainants an others, (one of whom was the efenant Biscoe) in trust for the payment of its ebts. That sai trustees an their successors remaine in office until the 2 of April, 1844, at which time complainants an efenant Biscoe were continue as resiuary trustees of sai Bank.
That the Bank by her Cashier assigne the note, by written enorsement thereon, to the original trustees. ,That Biscoe accepte the trust an entere upon the uties thereof, an that the note remains unpai, an cannot be recovere upon by a suit at common law.
Upon emurrer to the bill final ecree was renere against the complainants, from which they have appeale to this court.
The grouns of emurrer were, first, that the complainant’s remey was at law an not in equity, secon, that the cause of action was barre by the statute of limitation.
The first groun of emurrer, we think, is not well taken, Biscoe occupie the two fol attitue of payor an assignee, whereby he became also payee, in consequence of which the recovery by the trustees (if inee they ha any at law against either of the efenants) was not clear an aequate, such as to eprive them of the benefit of the more enlarge powers of the court of chancery to affor relief.
But we think the secon groun of emurrer to the bill well taken. By the complainant’s own showing five an a half years ha elapse between the time when the note fell ue an the commencement of this action. The recovery was upon a simple contract ebt. The statute ha commence running when the Bank, by her own voluntary act, transferre the note to one of the payors an others in trust. The efenants were not responsible for this; the principal in the note an one of his securities were in no way connecte with the transaction. So that even if Biscoe’s acceptance of the trust shoul, as to himself, be hel a suspension of the operation of the statute, (which we think was not the case] it cerainly coul not be sai to affect the lights of his co-efenants. On the contrary thereof, the statute having commence running before the assignment continue to run irrespective of it. That the statute may be relie upon as a bar to a recovery in chancery as well as at common law, as a general proposition, is ,well settle, an has been recognize by this court in the case of Taylor vs. Aams, July term 1853. An in cases of concurrent jurisiction courts of equity act in obeience to the statute rather than by analogy in their application of it. That the statute may be interpose, an that this case is of that class, in which the courts of chancery act in obeience to the statute, there can be no oubt, an the question to be consiere is as to whether the efence shoul be interpose by plea or answer, or whether when the facts appear upon the face of the bill, it may not also avail as a efence by emurrer to the bill.
As a matter .of practice this efence is most usually interpose by plea, or as in the case of Taylor vs. Aams, relie upon by the efenant in his answer; an we apprehen (unless where time uner the circumstances of the case is to be consiere in afforing or refusing the relief sought,) that in all cases, over which the courts of .chancery exercise exclusive original jurisiction, an in all others where the facts isclose by the complainant in his bill o not show that the right to recover is barre by limitation of time, this efence must be interpose either by plea or be relie upon by the efenant in his answer.
But where the cause of action is one over which the courts of law an equity may be sai to have concurrent jurisiction, or where the cause of action is such that in a proceeing at law the statute bar coul be interpose (in all of which we have seen thatthe courts actin obeience to the statute rather than by analogy in its application, an the bill upon its face shows that the right of action is barre by lapse of time) the practice seems to be well settle that the efect may be reache by emurrer .to the bill.
Such woul seem to be the rule lai own by Juge Story in his Com. on Eq. Pr. 484, an Daniell's Ch. Pl. & Pr. vol. 1, 621; an Juge Washington in the case of Wisner vs. Barnett et al., 4 Wash. C. C. R. 632, conclues his review of the English an American ecisions thus: “Upon the whole I incline to think that in cases where from the allegations in the bill, the statute of limitations may be urge as a bar to the remey, ifmay be one in the form of emurrer.”
The case before us, both as regars the allegations in the bill, an the nature of the eman sought to be recovere, comes irectly within the rule lai own by these authorities.

elivere the opinion Of the Court-.
This is a suit in chancery, brought in the. Crawfor Circuit Court for the purpose of having correcte a mistake in the escription of certain lans to which the complainant sets up title. The substance of the complaint is, that John Dillar, who resie in the county of Crawfor, was the legal owner of several quarter an fractional quarter sections of lan; composing one tract of about 937 acres, on which he ha a farm an resie with his family in the year 1841, an continue there to resie until his eath. On the 14th ay of September of that year, jugment was renere against him in the Crawfor Circuit Court, in favor of Thomas E. an Heiro T. Wilson, for $3,800, upon which execution issue on the 3 of August, 1842, which at the instance of Dillar, was levie upon the tract of lan oil which he so resie, but that the sheriff, in recoring his levy upon the writ, misescribe several of the tracts of lan levie upon, by recoring other tracts, not the property of Dillar, instea of those actually levie upon; that afterwars, at the instance of Dillar, his lans were appraise, an because no one woul bi two-thirs of their value, they were returne not sol. On the 30th August, 1843, an alias fi. fa. issue, on the back of which was enorse the former levy, an that uner this writ the sheriff avertise an sol the lan on the 25th of September, "" 1843, at public sale, to George W. Paschal for $500, to whom he execute' a ee for the same. That the same mistake committe in recoring the return- of the levy upon the original writ was continue in the after proceeings incluing the avertisements of the lan, an the ee to Paschal; but that the actual levy an sale were of Dillar’s lan.
It appears that Dillar was in embarrasse circumstances, an that several other jugments ha been renere in sai court against him, all of which as well as that of the Wilsons’ were uner the control of Paschal for collection. That at the instance of Dillar, it was agree between himself an Paschal, that Paschal shoul buy the property, then recognize by Dillar as his homestea place, an give him (Dillar) twelve months to reeem the same by paying Wilson’s jugment, an part of one of the other jugments uner Paschal’s control as collector. That Dillar ie without having reeeme the property, an that Paschal afterwars, on the 14th ay of September, 1849, conveye the lan to Joseph H. Bailey, by quit claim ee, for $3,000, an that Bailey on the same ay sol itto complainant for $1,000, payable in twelve months, an took from complainant a bon lor the payment of the purchase money, an execute to him a covenant, by which he boun himself to convey to complainant the lan upon the payment of the bon for $1,000. That both Paschal an Bailey in goo faith sol, an intene to convey the Dillar homestea place, but were le into a mistake in the escription of the lan by following that in the sheriff’s ee. Soon after the purchase óf complainant the mistake was iscovere, to correct which this suit is brought.
The plaintiff in execution, the aministrator an heirs of Dillar, Paschal an Bailey are mae efenants, an with the exception of the aministrator an one of Dillar’s chilren, an infant, the answers may be consiere as a full an circumstantial amission of the material- facts in issue.
The- aministrator enies all knowlege or information with regar to the levy, or sale of the property, or of any knowlege, unerstaning or agreement of his intestate, except that which he erive from the complainant’s bill, an touching these points oes not answer. The other allegations are from information an belief amitte. The infant efenant answers by guarian, an his rights are as fully protecte as if he ha by answer enie each allegation in the bill.
The main fact put in issue by the answer, is the fact of the allege mistake; an preliminary to an examination of the evience, is the question presente upon the exception to the amission of the eposition of Ogen. The objection to his evience is, that he is the security of the complainant to efenant Bailey for the purchase money of the lan in suit. It seems that Bailey at the outset was content to take the complainant’s bon, payable at twelve months, for the purchase money, an to hol the lan as secui’ity for the pa3'ment thereof. But when he ascertaine that there was a mistake in the numbers of the lan, whereby his security for the purchase money to the value of the lans not embrace in the ee ha faile, he became issatisfie an thereupon, by way of aitional security Ogen, Paschal, an others, execute to him a note for $1,000 payable at the same time the first note was to have been pai, with a memoranum enorse thereon by Bailey, that the payment of the bon first given shoul be a ischarge of the note,, whereby Ogen in effect became the security for the purchase money for the lan, part of which is now here in suit. This aitional security was taken in consequence of the iscovere mistake. There can be no question of Ogen’s immeiate interest in the suit; inee this is broaly amitte by counsel who notwithstaning argue that his interest is equally balance, because, let the suit be ecie for or against the complainant he must be ischarge. If for him, by requiring the $1,000 for which he is boun to- be pai before the ecree is renere, or if against him,, the court must necessarily rescin the contract, an cancel the note. As regars the first proportion, although the court might have ecree the payment ofthe purchase money at that time, it i not necessarily follow that such shoul be the ecree : an the ecree renere in this cause shows that such was not the case; so far from it, the express terms of the ecree are that the security shall not be ischarge. An, as respects the .other alternative, a rescisión of the contract is wholly inconsistent, as well with the allegations as the prayer for relief; au the answer of Bailey furnishes no groun for enlarging the issue. If the plaintiff ha oubts as to his title to the specific relief praye, he ■shoul have presente his case in a ouble, aspect, an praye relief accoringly. Story Equity Pl. 42. Moore vs. Maen, 2 Eng. 530.
Bailey no oubt was willing that the correction shoul be mae, his answer is alone responsive to that state of case, but it by no means follows that he woul assent to have his contract can-celle, an the eviences of ebt surrenere, upon a mere question of partial failure of consieration, nor can it be that a chancellor woul ecree that he shoul o so, unless upon an issue for that purpose an upon which he might be hear in efence, it be foun equitable that it shoul be one, so that the witness coul not -escape his liabilily upon either alternative; certainly not in the last, an it seems he i not in the first. He was clearly incompetent to testify, an his eposition shoul have been suppresse.
The remaining evience is by no means satisfactory upon the most important points in issue: the actual levy an sale of the lan not inclue in the sheriff’s return.
As regars the levy, the facts that the process was against Dillar, that there was returne upon the writ about the same quantity of lan really owne by him, that the valuation was taken at his instance, an that the appraisers i actually appraise the property known as Dillar’s homestea place, are all strong circumstances, an yet there is no positive proof that the sheriff ever intene to levy, or i levy upon these lans; but on the contrary, there are his official returns on several writs, his avertisement an ee, all his official acts which show affirmatively that he i not make such levy. As regars the sale, but one witness is foun to testify. He is strongly impresse with the belief that the sheriff announce to the by-staners that he offere the Dillar homestea place; of this he is not positive, an oes not remember the language use, nor can he say positively, that the sheriff i more than rea off the numbers from his levy, but thinks he i. This witness says that there were some forty persons present, an the fact that out of that number but one witness was examine as to the unerstaning at the time of the sale, in regar to the property sol, reners it improbable that if the property was offere as Dillar’s homestea, it was generally so unerstoo by the biers an by-staners.
The evience, upon which a written instrument or contract is altere or correcte, must be clear an free from oubt. In Henkle vs. The Royal Exchange Insurance Company, 1 Ves. 317, Lor Harwick sai the court ha jurisiction to relieve in re-. spect to a plain mistake in contracts in writing. In Ingram vs. Chil 1 Bro. 94, Lor Thurlow sai, “that a mistake creating an equity e hors the ee, shoul be proven as much to the satisfaction of the court as if amitte.” Juge Story in Unite States vs. Monroe, 5 Mason 577, sai “in cases of asserte mistakes in written instruments, it is not enie that a court of equity may reform the instrument, but such a court is very slow to exercise such an authority, an it requires the strongest an clearest evience to establish the mistake. It is not sufficient that there be some reason to presume a mistake, the evience must be clear, unequivocal an. ecisive.” An in Gillaspie vs. Moore, 2 Johns, Ch. Rep., Chancellor Kent reviews many of the English ecisions an fully recognizes the rule, that in all such cases the mistake must be clearly an fully proven.
So that this rule, when applie to contracts, may be consiere as well settle, an there certainly is no goo reason why the rule shoul not also be applie with equal force to the return ot a sworn officer, an to his ee eliberately mae an approve in court. Whilst therefore, corrections may be mae of mistakes when clearly an satisfactorily proven to be such, less than this strictness woul be attene with the most serious consequences, particularly where the instrument to be reforme or change is, as in this instance, the evience of title to real estate,
When teste by this rule, the evience before us, although it oes raise a strong presumption that the levy an sale were mae or intene to be mae of Dillar’s entire homestea tract, is not of that clear an conclusive character to entitle the complainant to relief.
We have not overlooke the groun taken by counsel, that the sale was mae uner a fi.fa., with a former levy enorse thereon, instea of a ven. ex. to sell the lans so levie upon, an that the whole tract was offere together instea of separate tracts, an also that the lans now sought to be recovere were (if sol at all) sol without having been previously avertise. These are all questions which may well be consiere in a suit like this, in the nature of a bill for specific performance, because courts of equity will not interfere to ecree specific execution of a contract, where manifest wrong or injustice woul result from it. To o so woul be giving ai to consummate a wrong commence, which is never one, 2 Story Equity 53.
It is true, that in this case the process an proceeings uner which the sale was mae, in connexion with the return, in which no formal levy appears to have been mae uner the secon writ, are of a oubtful character, (in regar to which, however, it is not necessary, uner the circumstances of this case, to express any opinion) an that the sale of the lans in ispute (if mae at all) was mae without notice an purchase by the attorney for the plaintiff in execution for $500, when, accoring to the appraise value mae some time before the sale took place, they were worth $7,900 or more, an by evience in this case, since the sale, $3000. §o that the lan was sol in all reasonable probability, for less than one-sixth of its actual value. All of these circumstances woul have been presente for consieration if the mistake as allege ha been satisfactorily proven.
.But as .such proof has not been auce, in view of the whole case .an the peculiar attitue in which the parties are presente upon the recor, an the facts connecte with their respective fights, we .think the ecree of the Circuit Court shoul be reverse an the bill ismisse.
Let the ecree be reverse, an the cause be remane with instructions to ismiss the bill with costs.

This action of ejectment having progresse to a trial by jury of the issue mae upon the plea of not guilty, the plaintiffs, to sustain the issue upon their part, after having auce evience to prove before the jury that Nathan Cloyes, the eler, ie in the year 1831, or 1832, leaving issue of lawful marriage four chilren surviving him, to-wit, Lyia Louisa, Mary E., Nathan Henry an Thomas; that Lyia Louisa, the elest of the four, was born in 1824, an the other three, successively, at perios of about two years between births: that Thomas, the youngest, ha ie-some years before in infancy: that Lyia Louisa was marrie to Robinson Lytle, one of the plaintiffs, an Mary E., to to Elias Hooper, another of sai plaintiffs, of which latter marriage issue ha been born alive; then offere to rea in evience, an prouce the same to the court, a ee of conveyance uly execute; by which the sai plaintiffs, Nathan H. Cloyes,'' an his wife, ha conveye to another of sai plaintiffs, the sai Absalom Fowler an his heirs an assigns forever, previous to the commencement of this suit, one-fourth part of the entire right, title, interest an claim of the sai Nathan H., an his wife, in an to the north-west fractional quarter of section number two, of township number one north of range number twelve west, containing about thirty 88-100 acres, it being state in sai ee upon its face, that sai lan was hel by a pre-emption right; an at the same time of offering sai ee as evience, the plaintiffs state to the court that they were prepare to prove an woul prove, in connection therewith, that the lans an lots in controversy are on an embrace within sai fractional quarter section of lan, that the efenants were in possession of the same at an before the commencement of this suit: that the same are situate in the county of Pulaski; that uner the act of Congress of the 29th of May, A. D. 1830, granting pre-emption i-ights to settlers upon the public lans, the Register an Receiver of the proper lan office in Arkansas, upon evience prouce to their satisfaction, grante a pre-emption to the sai Nathan Cloyes, the eler, now ecease, in his lifetime, to the aforesai fractional quarter section of lan, on the 28th ay of May, A. D. 1831, at which time the surveys were not perfecte an returne: that afterwars, an after the eath of the sai Nathan, the eler, his chilren an heirs at law aforesai pai to the Receiver of public moneys at sai lan office, the minimum price for sai fractional quarter section of lan, as fixe by the laws of the Unite States, an also for two small ajoining fractions claime by them uner the same right, an took sai Receiver’s receipt therefor, bearing ate the 5th of March, A.D. 1834, on which sai receipt the sai Receiver enorse, of the same ate, that a part of the lan so pai for, to-wit: the north-west fractional quarter section, forme a part of the location mae by Gov. Pope, in selecting one thousan acres ajoining Little Rock, grante by Congress to raise a fun for builing a court house an jail for the territory of Arkansas, an that such enorsement was mae by the irection of the commissioner of the General Lan Office. An .the sai plaintiffs, at the same time, offere to prove that such location so mae by Governor Pope, was mae after the sai grant of the pre-emption, an was null an voi. An they offere no other evience, an state they ha no other to show .title in the sai plaintiff, Fowler. But the efenants objecte .to the sai ee being rea in evience, upon the single groun that such conveyance to the sai plaintiff, Absalom Fowler, gave him no title by which he coul, jointly with his co-plaintiffs or otherwise, maintain an action of ejectment; an this objeclion having been sustaine by the Circuit Court an sai ee rejecte an exclue upon that groun, the plaintiffs took their bill of exceptions, from which the foregoing facts appear. An final jugment having been renere against them, they brought their case here by writ of error.
The question presente to us is, whether or not this specific objection, no other having been mae to the testimony offere, was well taken.
Our statute authorizes the action of ejectment in all cases, where the plaintiff is legally entitle to the possession of the premises (Dig. ch. 60, p. 454; sec. 1), an in all cases where he “claims the possession uner or by virtue offirst, an entry mae with the Register an Receiver of the proper lan office of the Unite States; secon, a pre-emption right uner the laws of the Unite States; thir, where an improvement has been mae by him on any of the public lans of the Unite States, whether the lans have been surveye or not, an where any person, other than those to whom the right of action is given by the preceing clauses of this section, is in possession of such improvement” (i. sec. 2): an on the trial it will be sufficient for him to “show that, at the time of the commencement of the action, the efenant was in possession of the premises claime, an that the plaintiff ha title thereto, or ha the right to the possession thereof as is eclare by this act to be sufficient to maintain the action of ejectment.” (i. sec., 11.)
We think it clear, from the phraseology of this statute, when consiere in connection with its remeial nature an obvious general esign, that it was not the purpose of the Legislature to confine its benefits to the purchaser in the first instance an to the pre-emptor in the secon, but equally to exten them to all persons, who might lawfully succee to their rights. The language use is certainly sufficiently comprehensive for this; an the lawful successors to such rights are as clearly within the mischief as the original purchaser or pre-emptor. Inee, ’not only woul such a narrow construction of the statute be against its obvious spirit, an contract the generality of the expressions use, but it woul be to lose sight of so much of the every ay transactions of common life in this State as relate to the tranfer from han to han of these imperfect titles of lan, an to suppose they were unknown to the Legislature. In accorance with this view of the statute, this court hel in the case of McLarren vs. Wicker an others, (3 Eng. R. p. 122), that a patent certificate issue to the father was sufficient to enable his heir to maintain the action of ejectment. It is true that, in that case, the court reste the transfer of the title to the heir, not upon escent, but upon the act of Congress, which eclares that when a patent issue to one who is ea, in pursuance of a certificate of purchase issue in his lifetime, the title shall enure to his heirs. The result, however, is the same, whatever may work the transfer, because the action in that case was sustaine, not upon the patent but upon the certificate, although brought by the heirs.
There can be no goo reason why, if the successor to the original purchaser or to the pre-emptor, can maintain the action when he succees to the rights of the purchaser or pre-emptor, by irect operation of law, that he shoul not o so if he succees to those rights by lawful acts of the parties. In both cases he succees by operation of law; in the one case, irectly; an in the other, inirectly by its operation.
It is true that, at common law, if a man ha in him only the right of possession or property, he coul not convey it to another,' lest, in the language of the ancient law, “pretene titles might be grante to great men, whereby justice might be troen own an the weak oppresse.” But this was for the feual reason that possession was an inispensable element of alienation, of which the law was so tenacious, even after the statute of uses, that a pretence title itself, woul not prevent the seizin of the lan from passing from the bargainor to the bargainee by virtue of that statute, where he was actually seize, although his title was but pretene. At the same time reversions an veste remainers might be grante, because it was consiere that the possession of the particular tenant was the possession of him in reversion or in remainer, an was not averse. An upon the same principle the better an more recent authorities show that an equitable interest was always assignable; because after the sale, out of which an equitable interest grew, the venor an those uner him, woul hol as trustees for the venee an those uner him, an therefore there coul be no such averse possession as to make the title pretene. But every vestige of this feual octrine, which thus restraine the alienation of real estate, has been swept off by our statute, which enacts that, “ Any person claiming title to any real estate may, notwithstaning there may be an averse possession thereof, sell an convey his interest in the same manner an with like effect as if he was in the actual possession thereof.” (Dig. ch. 37, p. 265, sec. 6). The next section {i. 7), eclares that “ The term real estate, as use in this act, shall be construe as co-extensive in meaning with ‘lans tenements an hereitaments’ an as embracing chattels real.” An Sir Ewar Coke says, that of these three, “hereitaments” is by far the largest an most comprehensive expression, because it inclue not only lans an tenements, but whatever may be inherite, be it corporeal or incorporeal, real, personal or mixe. An thus it appears that, although at common law, there were certain rights to an interests in real estate, that for want of possession, either actual or constructive, coul not be alienate to a stranger, although they coul be release or evise by will, or woul pass to the heir or executor — as contingencies an mere possibilities — such is the comprehensiveness of our statute in embracing hereitaments in the term “real estate,” that that istinction is also annihilate, an therefore, in this State, whatever interest in real estate may be inherite, may be bargaine, sol an conveye,. An it is expressly eclare by our statute of Descents, that the “real estate” in that statute contemplate, is every “estate, interest an right, legal an equitable, in lans, tenements an hereitaments, except such as are eterminable, or are extinguishe by the eath of the intestater seize or possesse thereof, in any manner other than by lease for years an estate for the life of another person.” (Dig.ch. 56, secs. 18, 19).
The result is, that as at the common law, all persons in possession were, prima facie, capable both of conveying an purchasing, unless the law ha lai them uner some particular isability personally, or as to the subject matter, so uner the operation of our statutory regulations all persons having an inherita-' ble right, interest or title, in or to any real estate, are pl'ahe in the same conition as to alienation or purchase. An there being no pretence of personal isability as to these parties,* an none as to the subject matter in consequence of the operation of our statute in enlarging the right of alienation an purchase almost to an unlimite extent in this respect, we cannot oubt but that, uner the ee of conveyance offere in eyience, if regularly execute an vali in other respects, Fowler succeee lawfully to so much of the right, interest an estate of Nathan-H. Cloyes, as the ee purporte to convey, as fully as it came-to the latter from his ecease father by irect operation of law.. We therefore think it clear that Fowler was a proper party plaintiff, equally entitle with the heirs to maintain ejectment uner-our statute, an that the objection in question was not well taken,, an ought to have been overrule by the court below.
For this error the jugment must be reverse an the cause remane to be proceee with.

elivere the opinion of the court.
On the 3 ay of October, 1851, the Bank eclare in ebt upon a promissory note mae by the efenant,- on the 22 ay of November, 1843, payable 12 months after ate. There was but one count in the eclaration. The efenant by plea interpose the statute of limitation.
The Bank replie, first; That on the ay of the execution of the note the efenants, together with their wives, execute a mortgage to her, upon certain real estate, to secure the ebt sue ' for; in which it was recite that by the rules an regulations of the Bank the note in question was payable in nine annual installments, the first payable twelve months after the ate thereof, at which time, in aition thereto, twelve months interest was to be pai in avance on the resiue of the ebt, an so on from year to year until the whole ebt shoul be pai, an proviing that in case the payments were so regularly mae, that the conveyance shoul be voi, but on failure in all or either of sai payments, the sheriff of Pulaski county shoul sell an convey the mortgage premises an apply the procees to the payment of the ebt; an averring that on the 1st March, A. D. 1848, the ebt being then wholly in arrears, neither the first nor any sub1 sequent instalment or any interest having been pai, the sheriff, in pursuance of the request of the Bank an of the provisions of the mortgage, avertise a sale of the mortgage premises, to take place in September following; whereupon Trapnali, claiming to be the owner of the mortgage premises, file a bill against the Bank, an procure an injunction restraining the Bank an the sheriff from proceeing any further with the sale, an that the bill is still pening an unetermine, an the injunction remains in force, by means whereof, as is allege, the Bank was prevente from pursuing her remey on the note aforesai.
The secon replication avers that the mortgage was mae cotemporaneously with the note eclare upon, as part an parcel of the same transaction, to secure the payment of the ebt, an that in the mortgage ee it was stipulate an eclare that sai note was payable in nine annual instalments, the first payable the 22 November, A- D. 1844, with interest, in avance on the resiue of the ebt, an yearly thereafter as set out in the first replication, an that the Bank accepte the mortgage, an that the same is still in force an in no way satisfie.
After oyer of the mortgage ee ha been crave an grante, the efenant emurre to both replications, in which the plaintiff joine; an the law having been foun for the efenant an the plaintiff electing to rest, jugment was renere for the efenant, an the Bank brought her case here by writ of error.
The Bank seems to rely in this court exclusively upon her first replication, an cites in support of it the twenty-seventh section-of the limitation statute, {Dig, ch. 99, p. 700), which provies that-“whenever the commencement of any suit shall be staye by an-injunction of any court of equity, the time uring which such in-junction shall be in force, shall not be eeme any portion of the-time in this act limite for the commencement of such suit.” ‘ If the Bank was proceeing to foreclose her mortgage, an the sta-tute of limitations ha been interpose, this provision of the sta-tute might, with more plausibility have been relie upon; but we think it clear that it cannot avail her, to isplace the bar in this case, where she is preceing at law to recover the ebt that was intene to be secure by the mortgage. The replication oes not set.up that the Bank was enjoine from commencing any action to recover the ebt, but from any “further proceeings in the matter of sai- sale,” an “restraining the sai Bank an the sai sheriff from- selling sai lots.” For aught that appears to the contrary in the replication, the Bank might have commence a suit at law, to recover the ebt for which the mortgage was but a security, at any time for near seven years, next before this action was commence; an inee this suit was commence an is still prosecute, as appears by this replication, pening the very injunction pleae in avoiance of the statute bar. It was the remey in rem only, that was enjoiue, not the inepenent remey in personam, now sought in vain by reason of the statute bar, which lapse of time has enable the efenants effectually to interpose against it.
The secon replication is equally ba,-because it oes not set up any matter in support of the promise eclare-upon, but a ifferent contract, which, if effectual for the purpose- for which it is-set up, woul be equally effectual to show that the Bank ha no right to maintain an action of ebt at all, when this one was commence. (State vs. Scoggin, 5 Eng. R. 331).

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This application, foune upon a suggestion of iminution supporte by affiavit, is to perfect the transcript of the recor in this case, either by appening to it the certifie copy presente, of the motion for a new trial in the court below, which was omitte by the clerk, as is allege; or by permitting the clerk, otherwise, to -amen the transcript alreay certifie in return of the writ of error, or- by permitting the plaintiff in error to withraw his assignment an have a special certiorari.
The writ of error in this case was regularly returne into this court, at the January term, A. D. 1853, an the efenant in error then entere his appearance to it by counsel. Afterwars errors were assigne, to which a joiner was interpose, an the cause argue an submitte by both of the parties. In the following July term, this court, upon looking into the recor, an iscovering the suppose iminution, pointe it out to the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, that he might have an opportunity to ri his clients of the ifficulty. An this application, in its manifol aspect, is probably esigne for this en, an presents the question whether or not it can avail.
No rule of practice is perhaps better settle in this court an elsewhere in courts of error, than that after joiner in error, no iminution can be allege; an the reason is, because it is by this means amitte by all the parties, that the i-ecor, upon which they have joine issue, is a true an perfect one; an therefore neither party can or shoul be permitte to contraict their own amissions: So well settle, inee, that it was remarke in the case of Cunningham vs. Ashley an others (13 Ark. R. p. 673), that “after the case is submitte the suitor can no longer be hear, an strictly speaking it is a contempt of court for him to attempt to be hear in any way.” But although this is so, no amissions of the parties can or ought to restrain the court, as a question of power, from looking into the recor before them. Accoringly in the plenitue of its authority, to be exercise in soun iscretion, this court may, at any time pening a writ of error, whether before or after assignment of errors or after the joiner therein, ex-officio, awar a certiorari to supply any efect that may appear, either in the boy of the recor, or in any of its branches. But among the rules of practice governing this iscretion, is that, “though the court, a informanum conscientiam curiae, will awar a certiorari to affirm a jugment, they will never awar one to reverse it or make error.” (2 Sauners Rep. 101, a, in the note an the ol cases there cite). This rule is as ol an as well settle, an as universally recognize as the other, an was applie in this court as early as July term, 1839, an often sine e, (The Auitor vs. Wooruff an another, 2 Ark. R 84); an there has never been any special case here emaning a eparture from it within our knowlege.
This latter rule of practice rests upon no sympathy for the efenant in error, although by the operation of the former rule his laches have cut him off from all means of helping himself, while the plaintiff in error uner like laches woul still have ample means of self protection in his right to ismiss his suit an sue out another u rit; because laches can never lay any founation for inulgence, an it is always time enough for a party, either plaintiff or efenant, after he has presente the merits of his case, to eman the correlative constitutional uty of having it ecie upon. But it procees upon the necessity of the case, in connection with the uty of the court to ecie the law, as far as practicable, in reference to the merits; which the law always presumes in favor of the jugment below, even if the contrary seems to be shown, if iminution is apparent upon the face of the transcript, an until it has been shown to be otherwise by certiorari.
But there being no such presumption of merits upon the other sie to suggest the ex-officio interposition of the court, an the party’s mouth being close by his amissions, his own laches can lay no founation for inulgence unless in some special case where, notwithstaning his right to ismiss his case after the suspension of the jugment of the court, that he might have opportunity to o so, his rights woul be absolutely cut off; an then it ought to be allowe him only upon the terms of costs, equivalent to what woul accrue upon the ismissal of his writ. An there might be other extraorinary cases when great elays of the aministration of justice might, uner peculiar circumstances, eman a eparture from the rule.
The provisions of our statute cite, have, we think, no relevancy to this application, because they were in the main esigne not to ai a reversal in this court, but to promote affirmances; an ■such of them as have application to proceeings in this court, have no place, as it is not pretene that our proceeings are irregular.
The cases cite from New York are all upon terms of cost, an in express terms are reste upon their own “special an peculiar circumstances,” an are epartures from the general practice in that State, which is in accorance with ours. An it is manifest that if these special cases are much inulge, the rules of practice, to which they form exceptions, will be entirely overturne, an the stimulus to parties, esigne by these rules of practice, to bring the merits of their cases before the court, in ischarge of their own uties, will cease; an as a consequence, justice often elaye by the merest negligence of counsel,,in' a court where they are presume to h ave the highest egree of skill an to exert all proper iligence.
The application refuse.

elivere the opinion of the. Court.
This is an action of trespass on the case, against the appellant’s intestate, for amages to the cotton an corn crops of the appellee, whilst in his employ, as his overseer.
Amongother evience the plaintiffbelow, having prove the signature of Dick & Hill to be genuine, introuce theff letter, stai ting, “ There were 178 bales of cotton, shippe us per So. Western, in ba orer, a goo eal of it was elivere in bulk an ha to be rebale, 28 bales were picke, the expense of which was $64 87, 23 bales were remae, the charge for ■ which was-$112. Three bales were lost in this operation, an there was-loss in weight on the picke bales, &c.” To which evience the efenant below objecte, but the court overrule the objection an permitte it to go to the jury. The jury brought in a verict for'the plaintiff for $797 43.
Now if the other evience, exclusive of this, were sufficient, upon which this verict might well be sustaine, although the court below manifestly erre in permitting this letter to be rea as evience to the jury, yet for this alone the verict ought not to be isturbe. But asie from this letter, there is no evience upon which so large an amount of amages, as containe in this-verict, coul be base or sustaine: The jury, therefore, must have epene in a great measure upon this evience in renering this verict. Dick & Hill were competent witnesses. Their evience, if esire by the plaintiff below, ought to have been obtaine legally, afforing the efenant an opportunity to cross examine them.
As to the other error assigne in the recor, we think the plaintiff having fixe the commencement of the term of service of the overseer by his eclaration to the 1st ay of January, A. D. 1843, an allege “that he entere on the uties of hi.s sai employment as overseer” on that ay, is boun by that perio, an cannot prove any injury he sustaine anterior to that time. For the reason, that this action woul be no bar to an action for injury sustaine uring a term of service anterior to this; because it coul not juicially appear that any amages ha been recovere for any such anterior term of service; an the eclaration itself specifying the commencement of the term of service, woul repel any presumption to the contrary.
It is by no means true that the specification of time is, in all cases, immaterial to be prove as lai in the eclaration. Where-ever time i's material, not only in matters of contract, but in matters of tort, the plaintiff is strictly boun by that time. Now in trespass, with an allegation of a continuano or iversis iebus, if the plaintiff insists upon proving repeate acts of trespass, he will not be allowe to give evience thereof, unless committe within the time specifie.” 1 Ch. Pl. 3 E. 258. Eastman vs. Bofish, 1 Story’s R. 528.
The court therefore erre in permitting the plaintiff to give evience of injury sustaine prior to the first ay of January, A. D. 1843, an for these errors the case must be reverse.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This is an action of trover from the Hempstea Circuit Court, institute by Pryor against Ryburn, for a negro woman an her two chilren. There was verict, an jugment for the plaintiff, motion for new trial, which was overrule an Ryburn appeale to this court.
For the purpose of establishing his claim to the negroes, Pryor prove in the court below, that in the year 1826, he was marrie to Martha Ann Ryburn, the sister of the efenant an the aughter of Matthew Ryburn, in the State of Tennessee; an that Matthew Ryburn gave the negro woman to Pryor after the marriage: an that some time afterwars, when the negro was about to be sol for Pryor’s ebts, Matthew Ryburn expressly refuse to forbi the sale, saying that he ha given the negro to his aughter,. Mrs. Pryor; an that Pryor hel continue possession of her until 1835 or 1836, with the exception of a year or two about 1830, when Pryor’s father hel the negro in possession. In the fall of 1836, Matthew Ryburn remove from Tennessee to Texas, an on his way receive the negro woman from Pryor an took her to Texas with him, Pryor furnishing her with a horse to rie. On the roa to Texas Matthew Ryburn calle her Pryor’s negro. She was hire for the year 1837, as Pryor’s negro, with the rest of his negroes. In the year 1838, Pryor an his father-in-law mae a crop together, an the negro woman was put in as Pry- or’s property with his other negroes, an Pryor receive one-thir of the crop. They continue thus to live an crop together till about February, 1843, when Matthew Ryburn, having move away, sent his son, Montgomery Ryburn, who came with a gun an took the negro woman forcibly from Pryor. After this, Matthew Ryburn kept the negro in possession till the 1st January,. 1844, when he execute a bill of sale for her an her chil Maria, to the efenant, for $750, an elivere them to him Since 1826 the negro woman has ha three chilren, now in possession of the efenant. Pryor also introuce a witness to prove that in 1837 or 1838, Matthew Ryburn eclare more than once that the negro woman was the property of Pryor or Pryor’s wife. The competency of the evience of this witness was objecte to by Ryburn, but overrule by the court an the evience permitte to go to the jury.
Another witness state in his epositions: “That E. L. Pryor continue to hol sai negro as his property, till the year 1830, when I as constable levie an attachment on her as E. L. Pry or’s property in favor of Sami. Pryor as will more fully appear by the transcript from the Comity Court of Montgomery county, Tennessee, hereto annexe,, marke A., which is mae part of this eposition. My recollection is that at the sale of the negro above name uner sai attachment, Sami. Pryor, the father of plaintiff, purchase the sai negro girl. He took her into possession an retaine possession for some time, an sent the negro to E. L. Pryor, who ha remove to the Western District of Tennessee. I think this was in 1831 or 1832,1 am not certain which.”
“Attache to this eposition was what purporte to be a transcript containing, First: A copy of a writ of attachment, issue out of an returnable to “the County Court of Pleas an Quarter Sessions,” of Montgomery county, Tennesse, ate 20th January, 1830, commaning E. L. Pryor to be attache to answer the complaint of Sami. Pryor; Secon: Copy of affiavit of inebteness-by Sami.. Pryor, sworn to the same ay before Charles Barby, a justice of the peace, who issue an signe the writ: Thir, Attachment bon of Sami. Pryor an surety; Fourth: Return on the writ; showing levy, after levy of other attachments in favor of Hynes & Slaughter, upon many articles of personal property, Pryor’s interest in 80 acres of lan, “one negro girl, Julia,” an “one negro boy, Armstea.” Levy enorse as mae 20th Jan uary, 1830. Fifth. Jugment in favor of Sami, Pryor vs. E. L. Pryor, for $1,427 50, an a memoranum that execution issue to the sheriff of Montgomery county, on the 5th of August, 1830, but ha not been returne.”
Ryburn then offere to prove by a witness that his father, Matthew Ryburn, ha frequently on various occasions eclare in. 1842 an 1843, that he ha merely loane the negro woman to. Pryor, an that Pryor ha often re-elivere her an acknowlege the loan. The testimony was objecte to an rejecte by the court.
Pryor objecte to all testimony as to the statements of Matthew Ryburn since 1826, offere to show that he ha only loane the negro to Pryor..
The following instructions to the jury were aske by Pryor an given by the court, an excepte to by Ryburn:
1st. That the measure of amages was the value of the property at the time of conversion, an interest thereon at six per cent.
2. That taking a bill, of sale for the negro, assuming an claiming ownership, acting as owner an enying Pryor’s claim, constitute a conversion; an no eman was necessary.
3. That a bill of sale is not necessary to pass the title to negroes, but they may as weU pass by elivery; an a. gift accompanie by actual eliveryjm subsequent peaceable possession can no more be revoke i^R a sale.
4th. That as to the valujpf the woman an chil, the efenant not having prouce tfin, an shown them not to be of the best quality, the jury mayTairly presume the strongest against him, an make the highest value proven the measure of amages.”
Among other instructions aske by Ryburn an given by the court, the three following were objecte to by Pryor an exclue by the court, to which Ryburn excepte:
1st. “That if the jury-^Éfelieve from the evience that Matthew Ryburn hel an retaine possession of the negro slaves sue for, as his own property an claime them as such, the jury are boun to fin for the efenant, unless there was some instrument of writing uly recore, showing that the title was not in sai Matthew Ryburn.”
2. “That if the jury believe from the evience that the negroes in controversy, before the allege sale, were merely loane by Matthew Ryburn to Pryor, temporarily, with the right to reclaim them at any time, no sale uner execution or otherwise, or process against Pryor, woul alter, take away, or estroy the rights of Ryburn, unless he (Ryburn), so conceale such loan as to enable Pryor, by using the property as his own for a length of time, to acquire creit on the strength of that possession of the property. But if there was no such concealment on the part of Ryburn, either actual or constructive, he might reclaim the property after such sale, to the same extent as before, whether the property remaine in the hans of the purchaser at such sale, or in the hans of a subsequent purchaser.”
3. “That the sale in Tennessee, if any such sale an subsequent gift took place, (an the jury are to etermine from the evience whether any such sale or gift took place) in no respect change the attitue of Ryburn an Pryor, in regar to the property.”
Ryburn file his motion for new trial on the groun,
1st. The amission of irrelevant an incompetent evience for plaintiff; 2, The exclusion of projK- an competent evience offere by the efenant. 3, Giv jBPimproper instructions for the plaintiff. 4th, Refusing instrucW aske by the efenant! 5th, Verict contrary to instructioiw 6th, Verict contrary to law an evience. 7th, Verict ex(0t ve an unwarrante by proof. This motion the court over'. s <■., an Ryburn took his bill of exceptions.
It appears from the bill of exception hat Ryburn file á plea of the statute of limitations of three years, in bar of the action, which, on motion of the plaintiff was stricken from the files, to which the efenant excepte. ife-
ist. The court below, in striking from the files the efenant’s plea of the statute of limitations of three years, committe no error. We think it clear the perio of three years oes not apply to an action of trover. This case oes not come within section 6, of the Revise Statutes, in relation to limitations. “Trover is not an action ior taking or injuring goos or chattels. It goes on the groun of a fining an conversion.” The efenant having file his plea of five years in bar, the plea applicable to this case, the court ecie correctly, in striking the other plea of three years from the files.
2. It appears that uring the trial, the plaintiff, to prove the gift of the negro, offere the eclarations of the onor mae subpequent to the allege gift, but before the onor parte with his interest to the efenant. The efenant, in orer to rebut this, an to show that the negrb was merely loane an not given, offere the eclarations of the onor mae uring the same time. The court below receive as evience the eclarations of the onor in favor of the plaintiff an rejecte his eclarations offere in behalf of the efenant. The principle is well establishe, by repeate ajuications, that although a man’s eclarations are not evience for him, they are evience against him, anhis subsequent venee must abie those eclarations. If the plaintiff ha relie alone on the evience of the gift an elivery of the negro, without resorting on his part to the subsequent eclarations of the onor, although competent for him to o so, the eclarations of the onor offere by the efenant against the plaintiff ought to have been rejecte. But as the plaintiff thought proper to resort to the eclarations of the onor to ascertain his intention, that testimony like every other ought to be given entire. We therefore think the court erre in excluing the eclarations of the onor offere by the efenant in this case. But in as much as the court i permit the efenant to prove by John W. Ryburn an Montgomery Ryburn, the subsequent eclarations of the onor against the plaintiff, in substance the same as that rejecte, we think the case shoul not be reverse for this error. Sims vs. Saners, 1 Harp. R. 374. 1 Bailey’s R. 113, 116.
3. Although the copy of a writ of attachment, the affiavit, attachment bon, the return on the writ showing the levy an jugment, mae an exhibit in the eposition of Jenkins, are no evience of the legality of the proceeings therein containe, or of the valiity of the subsequent sale of the negro uner them^ yet as facts or circumstances connecte with the acts an eclarations of the onor an in relation to which they took place, we think was goo evience to prove the negro was given an not loane, an for this purpose it was competent.
4th. The four instructions aske an given on the part of the plaintiff, we consier substantially the law. The only oubt that can reasonably arise is as to the 4th instruction, the substance of which is, “that the jury might make the highest value proven the measure of amages.” This we take to be the law.
5th. The first instruction aske an exclue on the part of the efenant is clearly erroneous. An instrument in writing' has never been hel necessary to pass the title to negroes.
6th. The secon instruction aske an exclue on the part of the efenant was also erroneous. For the reason that the title of the lener might be iveste in more ways than the “person in possession obtaining creit on the strength of the property,” as for instance, staning by an encouraging the sale of his pro* perty. The court, therefore, correctly exclue it.
7th. The 3 instruction aske an exclue on the part of the efenant was likewise erroneous. For the reason that the sale, taken in connection with the amissions an acts of the onor, was evience of the fact that the negro ha been given an not loane. Otherwise the sale an all the proceeings connecte therewith woul have been irrelevant an shoul have been exclue. The instruction, therefore, was not applicable, an therefore properly exclue-
The only remaining question to be consiere is as to the amount of amages given by the jury.
One witness testifie that he knew the negro woman in 1841 1842- — -thinks she ha one chil, an they were worth about $800, Another witness testifie that he owne negroes an knew the value of them; an that the negro woman an her chil in 1844, were worth $1300. Another testifie that in 1844 the negro wor snqn was worth $650, or $700, an her chil $300. Montgomery Ryburn testifie that at the time of the trial the negro woman an her three chilren were worth about $1250.

elivere the opinion of the Court..
The bill in this case, exhibite on the 10th of June, 1843, represents that upon the organization of the Real Estate Bank, fifty shares of stock were aware to Woo Tucker, for which he execute his stockbonin the sum of five thousan ollars, bearing interest atfive per cent.,together withamortgage on certainlans to secure the same, the mortgage pursuant to the charter being also conitione for the payment of all monies which he might receive from the Bank on account of subscriptions for stock therein, an the interest on such monies accoring to the requisitions an regulations of the Bank. That Tucker being so entitle by the charter, ha borrowe from the Bank, at two ifferent times, $2,400 on account of his stock creit, which with the interest remain wholly unpai, an for this breach of the conition the bill seeks a foreclosure an sale of the mortgage lans. It appears that Tucker execute two ees of mortgage, one on the 10th ay of September, 1837, of the following-lans in T. 5, S, of R. 9' W., in Jefferson county:
SE qr sec. 19,
W  sec. 29,
NEqr. sec. 29,
E i sec. 30, in all 639 acres.
This mortgage being acknowlege, was file for recor 'on the-10th of November in the same year.
On the 9th of November, 1839, Tucker execute a secon mortgage, conitione like the first, upon a part of the foregoing lans as follows:
SE qr. sec. 30,
W sec. 29, in all 282 acres.
This mortgage was acknowlege on the 13th of November, ' before the Clerk of the Jefferson Circuit Court, an on the same ay file for recor.
On the 21st of October, 1840, Tucker sol an conveye to the efenant, Wright, for the consieration of $2,800, the two tracts of lan last mentione, being the SE qr. sec. 30, an the W-J- sec. 29, which ee being acknowlege was recore on the 28th of the same month.
The effect of Tucker’s answer, file at October term 1843, putting the most favorable construction upon it, was to make the issue whether he ever was legally a stockholer in the Bank in conformity with the charter, an if so, he enie that the monies in question ha been borrowe on account of his stock creit; but on the contrary, he allege that they were upon personal security, the same as orinary loans upon paper iscounte by the Bank, an therefore not embrace in or secure by the mortgage.
Wright answere at the same term, isclaiming any knowlege or correct information concerning the transactions between Tucker an the Bank. He allege that on the 10th of April,-1842, he ha purchase at sheriff’s sale uner a jugment renere in the Pulaski Circuit Court, in favor of the Bank, on the-28th ay of September, 1841, the NE qr. sec. 30, an SE qr. sec. 19, sol as the property of Tucker, for the sum of one ollar, subject to all legal incumbrances, an that he hel the sheriff’s conveyance therefor, ate on the 11th ay of April, 1842, but no such conveyance was exhibite, nor was there any proof concerning it. He claime the benefit of his purchase from Tucker, on the 21st October, 1840, of the SE qr. sec. 30, an the W-?,- sec. 29, insisting accoring to his information an belief that Tucker ha goo right to sell an convey, an that there was then no legal or equitable incumbrance upon the same.
The cause came on to be finally hear at October term 1847, on bill, answers, replications, exhibits an the eposition of Newton for the complainants, an that of Davies on behalf of the efenants Those epositions relate to the issue in ispute, whether the moneys borrowe by Tucker were stock loans or orinary iscounts on personal security. The Circuit Court enie the relief an ismisse the bill for want of equity. It may be suppose that this ecree was renere in conformity with the previous opinion of this court, in the case of Duncan vs. Biscoe et al., 2 Eng. 175, that the Real Estate Bank ha only a fiuciary interest in the stock mortgages, which were esigne exclusively for the inemnity of the State an the holers of the bons, for the capital stock of the Bank, that no interest whatever in those mortgages passe by the ee of assignment, execute by the Bank to the Trustees, an that consequently they ha no right to foreclose them for any purpose. That ecision, likely to be attene with some unfortunate consequences, was overrule upon solemn consieration in the subsequent case of Wilson vs. Biscoe et al., 6 Eng. 44, where it was holen that the assignees might well foreclose those mortgages for the failure to repay moneys borrowe from the Bank on stock creit, an sell the mortgage lans, subject always to the ultimate an paramount lien of the State an the bonholers.
In accorance with Wilson vs. Biscoe, the ecree of the Jefferson Circuit Court in this case was reverse on the appeal of the Trustees, Biscoe et al. vs. Tucker et al., ib. 145, so far as the same question was involve, an the court then proceeing to consier another question arising out oí the peculiar facts at issue in this case, etermine in view of the whole transaction, that although Tucker gave personal security, it was only cumulative, as the Bank ha the right to require, See Dawson vs. R. E. Bank, 5 Ark. 283, an the real intention of the parties was that Tucker obtaine the loans on account of his stock creit.
On the remaning of the cause to the Jefferson Circuit Court, the efenants were allowe, against the objection of the complainants, to file amene answers; in which the only material new matter was that set up by the efenant Wright, who allege that Tucker ha purchase one of the tracts in controversy, namely, the NE qr. sec. 19, from one John McLain, for $3,000, taking McLain’s bon for title, on payment of the purchase money, an which bon for title he, Tucker, ha assigne to the responent. That the purchase money not being pai to McLain, Tucker, on the 2 ay of November, 1840, conveye the sai lans to one Sterling H. Tucker, in trust among other things to pay the purchase money ue to McLain, which was a lien on the lan. That pursuant to such ee, the Trustee, on the 9th April, 1842, sol an conveye the lans mentione in it to the responent, wherefore he claime to be sole proprietor of the lans, but if mistaken in that, he claime that the original purchase money, which he ha pai upon his purchase from the Trustee to satisfy McLain, shoul be a charge upon the lans an refune to him.
The whole cause was again put at issue, aitional epositions were taken relating to Wright’s purchase uner the ee of trust, an upon the secon hearing the Circuit Court of Jefferson county ecree that the money borrowe by Tucker from the Bank were not stock loan's, but merely private iscounts on personal security an coul not attach as a lien on the lans in controversy, by virtue of the mortgage, an the complainants were not therefore entitle to the relief sought, an even if they were, Wright was entitle to a prior lien on sai lans for the purchase money therefor pai to McLain, but on the grouns that the loans to Tucker were not connecte with the mortgage, ecree that the bill be ismisse.
There is a singular obscurity throughout the new matter set up in Wright’s amene answer. The only lan he alleges that Tucker bought of McLain is the NE qr. sec. 19, a tract not embrace in the Bank mortgage. He professes to exhibit McLain’s bon for title to Tucker, but oes not o so, an there is no proof whatever concerning it, when or upon what conitions it was execute, or when assigne to Wright, an none of the witnesses ■who epose about the sale from McLain, refer to any title bon, •or ientify the tract in question. It oes appear from the proofs .on the recor that, on the 2 ay of November, 1840, Tucker conveye to a Trustee the NE qr. sec. 30 an the SE qr. sec. 19, with power of sale, to pay in whole, or pro rata certain ebts therein recite, an among them a note to the State Bank mae by Tucker with McLain, as one of the securities, an it further appears that Tucker ha bought a tract of lan from McLain, but what tract is no where shown, an pai for it by the procees of a iscount in the State Bank of his own note with McLain as .security, an which note McLain was afterwars oblige to take up. An also that, on the 9th of April, 1842, the Trustee sol the lans mentione in the ee of trust to Wright in consieration of his paying to McLain the amount ue him for sai lans, an the further consieration of $250 pai to the Trustee, an Wright pai the ebt to McLain, by taking up his note in the State Bank for $1,400, an refuning to his aministrator the sum of $500 previously'avance for interest an curtails, in all $1,900.
Now, upon the case presente, the aitional matter relie on by Wright in opposition to the foreclosure amounts to nothing. But supposing that Tucker ha purchase one or more of the tracts of lan embrace in the mortgage to the Bank, from McLain, taking an orinary bon for title on payment of the purchase money, the claim of Wright in opposition to the mortgage woul harly be entitle to any serious consieration.
Upon the hypothesis most favorable to him, the transactions were, that Tucker mortgage to the Bank lan to which he ha only an equitable title, McLain having a prior lien for the unpai purchase money. Then Tucker conveye the lan intrust with power of sale for the payment of certain ebts of his, an among them that for the original purchase money. Wright bought the lan uner this ee of trust, the procees of the sale going to extinguish the ebt for the purchase money, an also took from Tucker an assignment of McLain’s bon for title.
If Tucker mortgage lan of which he was the equitable owner by virtue of a bon for title, his equitable title only was thereby encumbere.
When he mae the ee of trust he conveye only such interest as he then ha left, being what the court, in Brown vs. Morrison, 5 Ark. 223, call “the equity of an equity, or in other wors, a right of reemption still remaining.” If McLain ha assigne to Wright a note of Tucker for the purchase money, it might have resulte that such assignment carrie with it the right to subject the lan to its payment as a prior incumbrance. If Wright, being the security of Tucker for the purchase money, ha been force to pay it, that being the conition only 'upon which the venor coul be require to part with the title, the security thus paying might have a claim in equity to be subrogate to the venor’s lien. But the object an effect of the sale uner the ee of trust was to pay McLain an extinguish that lien, Wright comes in as a stranger or volunteer, the same as if he ha bought the lan irectly from Tucker on the 2 of November» 1840, subject of course to all incumbrances. If by the terms of that purchase, Wright having so agree, i accoringly pay off the original ebt to McLain, the result woul be the same as if Tucker ha himself ischarge that ebt out of the procees of the lan, or any other means of his. Tucker coul not for any purpose, sell or assign any greater interest than he himself ha in the lan, an the only effect of extinguishing the prior lien, which he was legally an equitably boun to o, or cause to be one, was to let in the mortgage as the next olest incumbrance.
It is not to be inferre from onr patient examination of this cause, that there is anything in the terms of the orer remaning it, 6 Eng. 148, which authorize the inferior court to open it for rehearing, or for the purpose of letting in further efences without any showing of equity: more especially as it appears that the transactions relie upon by Wright in his amene answer, transpire before the filing of the bill, an of which from their nature, he must have ha personal knowlege. The statute Digest, title Chancery, sec. 138, provies that upon the hearing an etermination of appeals in chancery, the Supreme Court, if it shall reverse the ecision or ecree of the Circuit Court, shall make such ecision, orer or ecree with costs, as the Circuit Court ought to have mae, “which when certifie to the Circuit Court shall be entere up as the ecision, orer or ecree of sai court, an shall be carrie into effect in the same manner as if the ecree ha been mae by the Circuit Court.” Whatever may have been the former practice of this court, an which, inee, has prevaile an been acquiesce in since its organization, we must conclue that the clear an explicit language of the section quote, makes it incumbent upon this court to rener a final ecree upon reversal, in all chancery causes brought here by appeal, whenever it appears that the cause was in a conition to have been finally hear an ispose of in the court below.
We a this qualification because there may be instances where this court, owing to its peculiar organization, not having original jurisiction in such cases, but authority only to hear an etermine the appeal e novo upon the law an facts, just as it was hear an submitte in the court below, might think proper, an within the spirit of the statute, instea of making any final ecree to reman the cause upon an issue or reference to ascertain a necessary fact, or upon some further equitable irections.
But as a general if not universal rule, when a chancery cause is ripe for hearing, an is finally hear in the court below, after all the opportunities affore for careful an mature preparation, consiering also the rehearing that may be sought in that court Upon petition, an the remeial jurisiction by bill of review, the ecision of this court ought to be final an conclusive upon the case as it is presente here by the recor in the appeal. It is to be presume that the parties have brought upon the recor every appropi’iate allegation an corresponing proofs essential to the etermination of their rights. In chancery appeals this court oes not sit, as in common law cases, for the correction of errors but for all the purposes of that appeal, as a court of chancery with authority to make such final isposition of the cause as the inferior court ought to have one. The cause has passe from the jurisiction of that court, an no questions can come before it, or be returne to this court for revision, except such as may rarely arise out of proceeings that are ha subsequent an in obeience to the manate.
When this court ecie, at January term, 1850, that the loan to Tucker was on account of his stock creit, after the lapse of that term, the ecision ha passe beyon its control, Ashley vs. Hye an Goorich, 1 Eng. 99, an the question of fact, if there was before any oubt concerning it, became irrevocably settle.
It woul then be extraorinary if the Circuit Court possesse the power it assume to exercise, of ecreeing, after the remaning of the cause, that the loans to Tucker were exclusively upon personal security, an not connecte with the mortgage. The repose an goo orer of society eman that there shoul, at some perio of a cause, be an en of litigation.
The vericts of juries are none the less conclusive because they o sometimes etermine a fact contrary to what may be the real truth. Upon the same principle, an no matter how injurious the consequences may be, the parties in the appellate court may be boun by the submission of a cause upon a iminishe recor, accoring to which one has affirme an the other enie that there is error. The appellate court, with a eep sense of all the obligations resting upon it, may sometimes mistake the recor, an will be liable to err in matters of law so long as men are liable to iffer in opinion. But the ecision in the particular case is forever the law of that case; see Porter vs. Hanly, 5 Eng. 186, referring to former ecisions of this court, an is conclusive not only of.those points that appear to be notice or ecie by the opinion of this court, but of every question of law or fact presente upon the recor, an which was necessary to have been ecie in orer to enable the court to arrive at such conclusion.
The ecree appeale from will be reverse, an the terms of a final ecree in favor of the appellants, settle an renere in this court, an certifie to the Jefferson Circuit Court.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court!-
It appears from the transcript in this case, that on the 20th of November, 1850, Carneal obtaine a jugment against Hanly in the Phillips Circuit Court. On the 20th of April 1853, a writ of fieri facias execution issue returnable to the May term following, an being levie on certain real estate of the efenant, the same was avertise to be sol. On the 23 of May, which was the first ay of the term, the efenant Hanly move to quash the execution because it bore teste more than a year an a ay after the renition of the jugment, an no intermeiate execution ha been sue out between that perio an the issuance of the one sought to be quashe. It may be concee, for all the purposes of this opinion, as having been mae to appear that no execution was issue upon the jugment within a year an a ay after its renition. The motion to quash being overrule, the efenant excepte an appeale to this court, an upon the granting of the appeal, he entere into recognizance, the effect of which was to stay further proceeings upon the execution, then in the hans of the sheriff.
Accoring to the ancient practice which grew up an became settle at the common law, if execution was not issue within a year an a ay, an kept renewe within like perios, the jugment in personal actions was presume to be pai, an the plain ¿iff was put to his action on the jugment, or require to pursue' the remey by scire facias affore at a later perio by statute!The issuances of execution were entere as continuances on the' roll, constituting the recor of the jugment. The object of the' new action or scire facias was to give the efenant the benefit of the presumption of payment, by enabling him to plea at law' payment or release. Execution might be ha after a year an a-ay when the jugment ha been entere with a stay of execu-tion, which repelle the presumption of payment, but otherwise; an where the jugment ha not been kept alive by the issuance of execution an continuances upon the roll, an execution, issue after a year an a ay, might be quashe as irregular. Accoring to the system uner which this practice originate an to which it was aapte, the jugment was not a lien, nor were lans sub-j ect to sale uner execution; an when afterwars they were mae subject, in a qualifie manner, by being extene an set apart to the creitor, until his jugment was satisfie out of the rents- an profits, the jugment came to be consiere as a lien, because of the right to issue execution, an by analogy to the lien on the chattels of the ebtor, which were boun from the teste of the writ. The law presume that the execution was an entire thing, an that it issue an bore teste upon the renition of the jugment, an that the sheriff began immeiately to execute; hence, the eath of the ebtor, after the suppose teste an before execution actually begun, i not stay execution against his property, in the hans of his representatives, an no scire facias was necessary in such case to revive the jugment in orer to complete execution. The law contemplate iligence on the part of the creitor, an as the jugment i not bear interest as a compensation for elay, an the execution ran usually against moveables, there was goo reason for inulging in the presumption in favor of the ebtor, that the jugment ha been satisfie where the creitor ha lain passive an taken no step to have execution for a year an a ay.
But in this State, from its amission into the Union, a ifferent system has prevaile, being introuce by statute, an to which the common law practice, though useful by way of illustration woul be inapplicable. The jugment is a lien on lans, which equally with chattels, are absolutely subjecte to sale to satisfy it. The lien on lan continues for three years from the ay of the renition of the jugment, an may be revive an kept alive for like perios of three years, not epening upon the ceremony of issuing an returning executions from time to time without further action, but by scire facias sue out before the termination of the lien. The execution is a lien only upon chattels an upon lans to which the lien of the jugment oes not exten, (that may be when irecte to another county,) or has etermine, from the time of its elivery to the proper officer to be execute. All jugments are require to be ockete an inexe, by entering abstracts of them in regular orer, in boun volumes, to facilitate the actual notice which the law has mae construe-1 tive; an jugments thus become a security for money equivalent, in many essential features, to a statute mortgage on all lans of the ebtor within the county or istrict to which the lien attaches. So long as the lien continues, or is kept alive in accorance with the statute, it is not impaire, nor oes any presumption of payment arise, so as to rener the jugment inoperative, in consequence of the mere elay of the creitor in proceeing to consummate the lien by the issuance of execution. If the jugment be satisfie in whole or in part by juicial sale, the statute requires such fact to appear by the officer’s return, which must also be copie, or an abstract mae of it, in an execution ocket; an whether pai upon or without legal process, it is mae the uty of the plaintiff, uner a penalty not exceeing five hunre ollars, within a certain number of ays thereafter, to enter satisfaction on the ocket of juments an ecrees; an on his refusal, the efenant, on application to the proper court, may cause such satisfaction to be entere. In aition to the resort to chancery, in cases where it may have jurisiction, the statute has also provie a summary remey by application to the juge of the court, out of which the execution issue, an upon ue notice to the opposite party, to supersee or quash executions, of which the efenant can always avail himself to show any subsequent payment or release, or other matter e hors the recor, whereby he woul claim the benefit of any creits, or insist that the execution ought to be supersee. By the Revise Statutes of 1839, Tille Limitations, sec. 30, jugments an ecrees thereafter renere are presume to be pai an satisfie, after the expiration of ten years from their renition, an by the act of December 1844, repealing the 30th section referre to, the like perio was aopte as a limitation of actions upon jugments!
Such, in brief an comprehensive terms, an so state only with reference to the particular case now before the court, is a summary of the statutes bearing on the question uner consieration. They contain no reference to the common law practice on this subject, nor any provision inicating an aoption of it! On the contrary, the two systems are, in many important respects, so issimilar that we must presume the legislature im tene, by those various statutory regulations in pari materia, the aoption of a system to the exclusion of so much of the common law as may be inconsistent with our own frame of laws, Digest, Title Commobt an Statute Law of Englan, sec. 1; an it is clearly the uty of courts to give effect to such intention, more especially when an implicit aherence to the common law forms or practice might lea to consequences that coul never have been contemplate by the framers of our statutes.
Entertaining these views, we are le to the conclusion that the opinion in Brackney vs. Woo, 7 Eng. 605. which hols that, in orer for the plaintiff to have execution of his jugment, he must revive it by scire facias, unless execution has been issue within a year an a ay from its renition, an regularly continue by the issuance of execution from year to year in orer to keep the jugment alive, an rebut the presumption of payment, was not well consiere, an cannot be reconcile with the provisions of law in force when it was pronounce. Inee, from the report of the case, it oes not appear that the inconsistencies here averte to, were urge upon the court or in any way notice by the opinion. The statute repels the presumption of payment within a year an a ay, an as the rights of the efenant are so carefully guare an protecte, no injustice can result to him by holing that execution upon an unsatisfie jugment may well issue at any time within ten years from its renition. As between the plaintiff an the efenant, a sale uner such execution woul be goo, though as against thir persons, the plaintiff woul lose the benefit of the lien of the jugment if omitte to be revive. The spirit of the statute woul seem to require that an execution, after ten yéars from the renition of the jugment an without any subsequent revivor, ought to be quashe, as having improviently issue upon a ormant claim, an this without reference to whether the formality ha been pursue of continuing executions within each year an a ay, so that the plaintiff being put to'his remey by action, woul have an opportunity of rebutting the presumption of payment, or avoiing the statute bar, provie by the act of December, 1844, if by any matter he might lawfully o so. But to require a revival by scire facias, after each, omission of execution for a year an a ay, for the mere purpose of letting in proof of payment or release, woul be foreign to the policy of the statute, an a practice expensive an vexatious to both plaintiff an efenant. The case of Davis vs. Helm, 3 Smees & Marsh. 17, relie upon by counsel in one of the cases uner submission, an epening upon the same question, falls short of sustaining the position in support of which ■it is cite. The point there was, whether upon a jugment •against two or more, an one of the efenants ying, the plaintiff might have execution against his aministrator without revivor, an the court ecie that the statute making the jugment a lien, i not, by analogy to the common law, enable the plaintiff to complete the execution as if alreay begun, or ispense with the scire facias to bring in the representatives. This woul be a very plain question with us, Bently vs. Cummins, 4 Eng. 487, if inee, in accorance with the aministration law, the creitor woul not have to be remitte for satisfaction, as against the estate of the eceent, out of the assets before the court of Probate.
After the ecision in Brackney vs. Woo, the General Assembly passe an act, approve January 10th, 1853, Acts of 1852, p. 121, the first section of which is as follows: “It shall an may be lawful for any party plaintiff to any jugment or ecree renere by any of the courts of this State, to issue execution thereon, at any an all times within ten years from the renition of any jugment or ecree as aforesai, without revivor; except in case of the eath of either party to any such jugment or ecree.”
It is argue that this statute is not retrospective in terms, an even if it was so expresse* such an operation ought not to be allowe by any juicial construction. Inasmuch as the statute is prospective for the only purpose contemplate by it, that is, the issuance of execution, it woul be ifficult to maintain that the application of it to jugments previously renere, impaire any veste right of a efenant, lessene his remeies, extene the life of the jugment, or affecte him in any way, save to relieve him from the burthen of costs occasione by useless revivals. But having consiere that the provisions of the act quote, so far as they relate to jugments of a Circuit Court, are only eclaratory of what the law was before, the jugment appeale from must, in any view of the case, be affirme.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This suit was institute on the 22 of March, 1849, by the Bank against the efenants upon a promissory note for $6,430, purporting to have been execute by them, on the 1st of July, 1843, in favor of the Bank, ue twelve months after ate, an negotiable an payable at the Branch of the Bank at Batesville. The only material enquiry arises uner two of the pleas interpose by the efenants; 1st. Nil clebet sworn to, being the same in effect, uner our statutory practice, as non est factum ; 2 that the note in question was given by them without any consieration whatever therefor.
The history of the transaction, accoring to the unispute facts appearing in the recor, woul seem tobe as follows: That on the 10th of February, 1843, when the act to place the Bank of the State of Arkansas in liquiation took effect, the Bank at Batesville hel five notes of William L. McGuire, amounting in the aggregate to $6,850, all either then ue or falling ue shortly after that perio. Uner the liquiation act passe at the session of 1842, Daniel J. Chapman ha been electe Executive Receiver, an Thomas S. Drew as Financial Receiver of the Branch at Batesville, the especial uties of the former being to turn his. attention to the situation an circumstances of the ebtors to the Bank, to enquire into the sufficiency of all security offere, &c.; an of the latter to atten to the keeping of the books, accounts, notes an moneys of the Bank, to receiving the calls an interest on the ebts ue her, an to the making out of reports, statements, &c. An they constitute a boar for the management an control of the business of the Bank or Branch uner their immeiate charge. There were also attorneys electe for the principal Bank an each of the branches, who were authorize, though not require to presie at the respective boars, an in case of a isagreement between the Receivers, shoul ecie between them. The sufficiency of any security offere upon the renewal of any note was to be approve by both Receivers, an such approval entere upon the minutes of their proceeings, an if not so approve, such security shoul not be eeme sufficient. Acts of 1842, p. 79. The ebtors of the Bank were require, uner penalty of forfeiting all claim to further inulgence, to come forwar within ninety ays after public notice, irecte to be given by the respective Receivers of the principal Bank an branches, an pay all arrearages of interest an costs, an upon oing so were privilege to renew their notes for one year by giving satisfactory security, to be approve by the Receivers, an paying interest at seven per cent, in avance, an as such renewal notes became ue, the subsequent calls upon them were to be so regulate as that the whole ebt shoul be calle in within ten years in regular annual calls. Ib. p. 80. Various persons were securities of McGuire upon the five notes of his referre to, Chapman, the Executive Receiver, being on one of them. On or about the 1st of July, 1848, McGuire offere to the Receivers the large note here sue upon, in consoliation of his five notes, the securities upon it being Ewin R. McGuire an Thomas Hughes, who were also securities upon some of the other notes. The arrears of interest on the ol notes over ue, an iscount upon the new one, amounte to $849 96, the curtail to be pai uner the liquiation act was $420, making in all $1,269 96, which W. L. McGuire ha to pay in cash in orer for his notes to be renewe as propose.
We may anticipate here the material enquiry of fact in the case for-the jury to etermine, which was, whether the new note for $6,430 was accepte in substitution for the ol ones, by way of renewal, an if so, it woul operate to ischarge the ol notes as a payment of them, the transaction being the same in effect, as if the ebtor, accoring to Bank usage, obtaining a new is-. count, ha applie the procees of it for that purpose. An a fair test of this woul be to enquire whether in case the Bank ha sue the principal an securities upon the ol notes, they coul Jraim sustaine a plea of payment upon the same state of proof as to the acceptanceof the consoliate note in rene w.al. Because,, so far as the principal ebtor is concerne, it woul not be possible in law that he shoul be liable upon two ifferent sets of notes or securities ofequal grae for the payment of the same ebt; but oneorthe otherofthem must be without consieration, no new or further consieration appearing, nor anything from which it coul be inferre that the latter note was intene to be collateral to the former. The result woul be the same if accoring to the shape of the transaction, the ol note ha been ischarge by a release or any vali agreement in the nature of one, or satisfie by an accor execute.
The eposition of Drew, taken in Louisiana, in August, 1852, makes out the case fully in favor of the Bank. He goes into a etail of the whole matter an states that his recollection has been refreshe by an inspection of the books of the Batesville branch, mae by him in 1850, at Little Rock (where they ha been remove pursuant to the act of January 9th, 1849, Acts of 1848, p. 71, withrawing the branches an concentrating the assets an papers of the Bank at Little Rock,) an that it is more istinct, from the fact that the ebt of McGuire was perhaps the, largest ue by any one iniviual to the Batesville branch. His version of the transaction is that at the time of offering the new note, on 1st of July, 1843, W. L. McGuire eposite with him $1,000, towars the cash payment require to be mae, an McGuire being unable to raise any more money, the following arrangement was agree upon an close between him an witness, Drew, on the 29th of August, 1843, the same being entere on the books of the branch Bank. Among the five ol notes of McGuire was one for $300. A creit of $30 was entere upon this note, so as to reuce it to $270, the amount of cash for which McGuire was short on the propose renewal, an this note thus reuce, was retaine as security for that cash balance. The new note for $6,-430 was then passe an acceptein renewal ofthe other four notes of McGuire an his various securities. An at the trial the Bank prouce these four notes cancelle, an the fifth note for $300 unpai an having a creit enorse of $30, as state by Drew. He eposes that the Receivers at the Batesville branch, being entirely satisfie with the sufficiency of the securities on the note for $6,430, an with the note itself then offere, receive, accepte an approve the same, an he thinks it was properly entere on the books of the Bank, an thenceforwar hel as the note of the Bank. The substance of his eposition may be expresse in his own language, that “sai note was receive an accepte in renewal of the four notes before mentione, on which W. L. McGuire was principal, an those four notes were extinguishe, ischarge an cancelle, an no longer kept on the books of the Bank or consiere as assets.” Magruer, who succeee Drew, as Financial Receiver, in October, 1844, testifie that the new note here sue upon an the one for $300 with the creit of $30 on it, were turne over to him by Drew as assets, an he receive them as such, not passing upon or questioning the sufficiency of the security, which he suppose to be goo, an so, on going out of office-, he turne over the notes in question to his successor. He ha no recollection of ever before seeing the four cancelle notes that were prouce on the trial.
On the other han, Chapman, who ha been Executive Receiver until the close of the year 1843, testifie that about the time as state by Drew, McGuire ha offere the consoliate note for renewal of his inebteness, an pai $1,000 leaving some $300 to be pai in money. That while he was in office the new note ha never been put to a vote of the boar, or approve by him; that he consiere it oubtful whether the securities were sufficient, anhe so avise the Financial Receiver, an he woul not approve it, because the ol notes of McGuire were well secure, an the parties to the renewal note offere, were liable to the Bank as securities on other notes, an besies being a security himself on one of the ol notes to the amount of $1,900, he wante further an unoubte security, as a matter of personal elicacy, before he woul assent to any arrangement which woul have the effect to ischarge himself. He thinks that while he was in office the pote was entere on the offering book for renewal, but never was passe upon the minutes or leger, as having been approve by the boar.
The circumstance that the officers of the Bank retaine possession of both sets of notes, woul not be important either way, as it was in proof that it was not customary for the ebtors of the Batesville branch to take out their notes when pai or cancele.
The efenants prouce two letters from Drew, while he was-Financial Receiver, aresse to W. L. McGuire, one of them; ate August 14th, 1844, more than a year after the note in-question ha been offere for renewal, in which he writes, “The payment you mae to the Bank on the 29th of August last, of"" $1,000, lacke $270 of paying the calls an interest on your several notes that were intene to be consoliate into one. This-note still awaits your further payment of that balance before it can be poste, which I am now anxious to o, an inee it will be necessary, before your note passes an the others can be cancele.” An he conclues, “It may possibly require one or two more names on the large note, as it embraces all your liabilities without several of your enorsers on the ol notes.”
The secon letter accompanies a statement of the amount require for renewal, an is without ate, but in it he says, “I am about to retire from office in a few ays, an until you pay the-above balance of $269,1 shall be unable to apply the above pay] ment to your creit in ue form. It has been suffere to remain unacte upon in consequence of a knowlege that you ha claims against the Bank for fees as sheriff, an supposing they woul be mae out an broughtin as early as convenience woulpermit.” An aing,'‘As neither of your securities have renewe their own notes, the Receivers will expect an aitional name on your note as it is large.”
Finally, it was prove on behalf of the efenants, by Ring-gol, the former Cashier of the branch at Batesville, an by Magruer who ha been also a clerk in the Bank at Little Rock,that the marks of the canceling hammer on the four ol notes prouce at the trial, were those of the canceling hammer of the principal Bank, an were not mae by that of the Batesville branch, the impressions being istinguishable. So that the actual cancellation coul not hav’e been mae at Batesville, but must have been one at Little Rock, as late as 1849, after the branches were calle in.
Now, it is true that, uner the issues the burthen of proof was upon the efenants, an it may be possible that within the few ays before Drew went out of office, McGuire may have come in, an by some means, though no where explaine, perfecte his renewal so long eferre; an though, if so allowe, it might not have been in accorance with the liquiation act. But without further comment, an laying asie the circumstance of the cancellation, as being more curious than important, the two letters to McGuire, written by Drew while the transactions were recent, are so inconsistent with his statement's mae nine years afterwars, as to raise a violent presumption, that he was mistaken in his recollection of every material fact touching the pinch of the case; an this conclusion appears to be so irresistible that the jury were warrante in isregaring his entire eposition.
But for the earnestness with which this cause has been presse in argument, it might have been briefly ispose of as an orinary case where a jury have passe upon a conflict of testimony, an after the refusal of the court below, in the exercise of its soun iscretion to set asie the verict upon the motion for new trial mae on behalf of the Bank, it ought not to be isturbe by the appellate court. We may concee the legal propositions contene for by the attorney representing the plaintiff in this court — that accoring to the authorities cite, there may be instances where the breach of the charter of the Bank in making a contract, cannot be set up as a efence in an action on such contract, as, for example, where a irector becomes principal or enorser to an amount prohibite by the charter. So the omission of the Financial Receiver to keep a recor or minutes of the proceeings of the boar in the approval of new notes, an the sufficiency of the security offere, woul not vitiate a renewal in fact mae, that part of the liquiation act being irectory. An equally goo law, that a corporation may by her acts subsequently aopt or ratify the contract of her officer or agent not uner seal or mae without authority, so as to make it bining on the corporation or confer a corresponing right of action in her favor upon it. But in such case it must be assume that there was a contract mae, not a pening negotiation, but an agreement execute. The point here is, whether the offer of renewal ever was perfecte, so as to take effect as a contract — whether Drew himself, as an officer of the Bank, either in accorance with the liquiation act or in violation of it, ever i accept the renewal note, or approve the security. The jury must have conclue that he i not.
Some of the instructions given on motion of the efenants are certainly objectionable, as argue for the plaintiff; because two of them are mere statements of legal propositions, not purporting to apply to any suppose state of case mae by the evience. For instance, the last instruction is as follows, “A contract is an agreement between two or more persons foune upon a sufficient consieration to o or not to o a particular thing, an the very life of a contract epens upon its mutuality between the parties to be affecte.” This moe of charging juries ought to be strongly conemne. Nisi ptius attempts at legal efinitions are apt to be faulty, an though goo law as mere abstract propositions, they are in nine cases out of ten calculate to confuse or mislea a jury. The secon instruction, -“That where a witness has testifie falsely to any one material ¡fact, it throws a suspicion upon his whole evience an such evience shoul be isregare unless corroborate by other testimony,” is even more objectionable because it assumes as true or proven the state of fact -upon which it is preicate. As the practice oes not prevail in this State forjuges to give a regular connecte charge, we have to reiterate the views expresse in Floy vs. Ricks, at July term, 1853, that without regar to any -set form or phraseology, every instruction aske for shoul be hypothetical, that is, preicate upon the supposition that the j ury fin certain facts .to be prove or isprove, then the legal consequence resulting therefrom is one way or the other accoring as the law is claime by either party, so that the jury hav ing to pass upon mixe questions of law an fact may shape their verict accoring to the juge’s opinion of the law. Where juries choose to fin a special verict, they evolve upon the court, where it ought to rest, the responsibility of eciing the law. When the juge charges a jury in anticipation of the general verict, the only ifference is, that he unertakes to tell them in avance, what the law woul be in case they shoul return any given state of facts by a special verict.
An yet the court is place in the embarrassing position of refusing to awar a new trial because upon the whole recor, we are not prepare to say that the motion for new trial ought to have been grante in the court below, an we o not feel safe in presuming that another jury woul, or ought to fin ifferently. An moreover the court below gave all the instructions aske for on behalf of the plaintiff, an which were carefully an elaborately frame so as to present the case to the jury in the most favorable aspect for a recovery.

elivere the opinion of the Court.-
• Pening the trial of a criminal prosecution in the Clark Circuit Court, the present appellant, Cossart, being introuce an sworn as a witness on the part of the State, refuse to answer a certain question propoune to him, relative to the issue in the case then progressing; for the reason, as he state to the court, that his answer thereto woul criminate himself an subject him to an inictment. The court irecte Cossart to answer the question, an upon his refusal to o so, ajuge him in contempt an orere that he be fine in the sum of one ollar; for which, together with the costs of that proceeing, jugment was renere in favor of the State. Cossart took a bill of exceptions, an praye an appeal to this court, which was grante.
The question thus sought to be presente for the ajuication of this court, is no oubt the same ecie in the case of The State vs. Quarles, 13 Ark. 307, sustaining the .constitutionality of the statute, which enacts that, where two or more persons are concerne in the commission of any crime or misemeanor, either of them may be sworn as a witness in relation to the same, but the testimony given by such witness, shall in no instance be use against him in any criminal prosecution for the same of-fence; an on the supposition that it evolve upon the propose witness to represent, as part of the reason assigne for his refusal, that his answer to the question might ten to criminate himself or subject him to a prosecution for some other offence or criminal act, istinct from the one for which the prosecution was-pening, an to which the question relate, we might not hesitate to hol, in accorance with that ecision, that the provision of the constitution to the effect that, in all criminal prosecutions,, the accuse shall not be compelle to give evience against himself, was esigne for the protection of the-accuse, not as immunity for crime; an to tbe extent that the statute referre to coul, affor such protection to a witness, it was no invasion of his right to be exempt from self accusation touching the same crime or misemeanor about which he is calle to testify. However elicate the uty of enforcing that statute may sometimes be, where the compulsory evience woul relate to a capital of-fence, or a lesser grae of.'felony, not yet barre, as against the witness, by limitation of time, we might, if a proper case were presente on this recor, be again require to express the opinion that the law may be so cautiously aministere as to sub-serve the ens of public justice, without violating, the spirit of the constitution.
But the enquiry is, whether a person, who may think himself aggrieve by a proceeing against him in the inferior court for contempt, can obtain any reress in this court, by appeal or writ of error. As uniformly hel, the appeal provie for by statute in common law an criminal cases, is cumulative to the remey by writ of error, an the rules governing them are the same; so that unless a writ of error will lie to an orer punishing as for contempt, there woul be no authority for entertaining an appeal in such a case. We o not propose to go into any elaborate examination of this subject. We are persuae that the statute, Digest, Title, Ckimistal Pkoceeings, sec. 225, et seq. allowing appeals an writs of error in criminal cases, applies to prosecutions by inictment or presentment, an was not esigne to. exten, nor oes it in terms, to summary convictions for contempt of court, which, though in the nature of criminal proceeings, are not public prosecutions for any criminal charge, which an accuse can only be put to answer by inictment, presentment or' impeachment, an for the trial of which a jury may be emane. The power of punishing summarily an upon its own motion contempts offere to its ignity an lawful authority, is one inherent in every court of juicature. The offence is against the court itself; an if the tribunal have no power to punish in such case, in orer to protect itself against insult, it becomes contemptible, an powerless also in fulfilment of its important an responsible uties for the public goo. It is no argument that the power is arbitrary, though inee settle by preceents or' limite by them as rules for the future guiance of the courts. While experience proves that the iscretion, however arbitrary,, has never been liable to any serious abuse, it woul be a sufficient answer to say that the power is a necessary one an must-be loge somewhere. An it is properly confie to the tribunal against whose authority or ignity the offence is committe. One court ought not, inee cannot unertake to juge of a contempt committe against another court. In a great variety of instances the emeanor punishe as contemptuous, if examinable elsewhere, might become intangible or inappreciable. If a contumacious witness, juror, party litigant, or counsel, be entitle to an appeal or writ of error, he coul also claim the full benefit of a superseeas or stay of execution of the sentence, by complying with the statute in such cases, an thereby effectually check the machinery of the court in its operation, an frustrate-the wholesome aministration of the law. The statutory regulation of the writ of habeas corpus, Digest, ch. 81, Art. 3, sec. 6, an the statute itself; ib. ch. 36, which woul seem to limit, while it purports to confer the power of punishing for contempts, are inconsistent with the iea that the han of the court may be staye' in the act of exercising its authority, an the pening question of contempt between the court an the party concerne, ajourne on appeal or error into another forum. At the common law no writ of error lay in such case; nor woul a prisoner for contempt be release on habeas corpus, by a ifferent court. L. Mayor of Lonon’s case, 3 Wilson 188. Ex parte, Kearney, 7 Wheaton, 38. Ex parte, Tobias Watkins, 7 Peters, 568. Yate’s case, 4 John. 317. An the ecisions in the Unite States are to the same effect, that there can be no appeal or writ of error. Johnson vs. The Commonwealth, 1 Bibb, 598. The State vs. Tipton, 1 Blackfor, 166. See also The State vs. Woofin, 5 Ireell, 199. Martin’s case, 5 Yerger 546. In Hummell’s case, 5 Watts, 431, the court intimate that, by reason of its superintening jurisiction, it woul revise the proceeings of inferior courts in contempt cases by certiorari. In Bickley vs. The Commonwealth, 2 J. J. Marshall, 572, the court, not intening as they sai, to isturb the authority of the opinion of Ch. J. Bibb, in Johnston’s case, yet eparte from it by reversing upon a writ of error, a sentence of imprisonment for contempt, because the inferior court ha exceee its authority. An while concurring in the result of the case of Neil vs. The State, 4 Eng. 259, where the sentence of the Circuit Court striking an attorney from the roll for six months, for an out oor charge against the juge personally an not officially, the attorney isclaiming any insult or contempt to the court, was set asie on error, it is sufficient to say of it on this point, that the question, whether such was the proper moe of seeking reress, oes not appear to have been raise or consiere. Though by not inicating what remeies woul be available, in the variety of cases where it might be allege that the inferior court, in punishing for contempt, ha exceee its lawful authority or jurisiction, it is not to be unerstoo that in such cases there can be no remey; yet we are clear in the opinion that accoring to existing law, there is none by writ of error or appeal.

elivere the opinion of the Court!
Coleman applie to the White Circuit Court for a rule upon McDaniel to show cause why a manamus shoul not be aware to compel him to issue execution upon a jugment which, the petitioner allege, he ha obtaine against one Walter, on the trial ha before McDaniel, as a justice of the peace, of a suit in which the petitioner was plaintiff an Walker was efenant, on the 6th ay of September, 1851, to which ay the summons issue by the justice in that suit an which ha been uly serve on Walker was returnable. The magistrate, in his response, amitting that he ha renere such jugment, as set forth in the alternative writ, further state that afterwars an on'the same ay the jugment was renere, an application was mae to him by Walker’s counsel, to set it asie an grant a new trial, because an offset, offere to be file on the part of Walker, ha been improperly rule out at the trial in question; an he, the responent, being satisfie that he ha erre in rejecting the offset, i set asie an vacate that jugment an grant a new trial, of which new trial the petitioner, Coleman, ha notice. That upon a secon hearing of the case, a jugment was renere against Coleman, which stans in full force upon the responent’s ocket as a justice of the peace, unsatisfie an unappeale from; an there being no longer any such jugment as that allege by the petitioner, the responent submits whether he can or ought to issue execution upon it. Upon the hearing the court below ajuge that a peremptory manamus issue.
This case presents a question of no little interest to the numerous class of suitors before magistrate’s courts,- that is, whether a justice of the peace can set asie a jugment an grant a new trial. An it is one of some ifficulty; because justices of the peace being juicial officers, it woul seem that so much iscretion ought to be confie to them, as woul enable them to correct their own erroneous jugments, by granting anew trial. But the Legislature has not thought proper to provie for such remey, an the power cannot be inferre as one inseparable from a court of such inferior an limite jurisiction. While the General Assembly coul not eprive justices of the peace of any part of the jurisiction given to them by the constitution, or even so legislate as to clog or impair it, or prevent its exercise by omitting to legislate Moore vs. Wooruff, 5 Ark. 214, there can be as little oubt that the moe an manner of exercising their jurisiction may be controlle an regulate by law. The various provisions of the statute concerning justices of the peace an regulating the proceeings in suits before them, are so minute an specific, as by intenment to exclue the power of granting new trials in conteste cases, to which no allusion is mae. A justice of the peace may ajourn causes from ay to ay until the business qn his ocket is ispose of, Digest, Title, Justices of the Pf.ace, sec. 11; may ajourn a case, ifhe eems it necessary, not exceeing thirty ays, ib. sec. 71; may grant continuances for cause shown on the application of either party not exceeing sixty ays, ib. sec. 75; may set asie a jugment of non-suit or by efault, if applie for within fifteen ays; ib. sec. 89, an then the justice is require to make out an cause to be serve, in the same manner as a summons, a notice to the opposite part¿ of the time an place fixe for the new trial, ib. sec. 91. Either party aggrieve by the jugment of a justice may appeal within thirty ays (except from a jugment of non-suit, or by efault, where no application is mae within fifteen ays to set it asie) to the Circuit Court, where the trial is e novo upon the facts an merits, ib. see. 174, et seq., whereby the party aggrieve is relieve from all apprehension of irreparable injury by means of an unjust an erroneous ecision, an if the right of appeal be lost without any fault of the party, or is attempte to be taken away by the legislature, the supervising controll of the superior courts may be exercise in some other appropriate moe.
Leaving out of view any case where the new trial might be grante by consent of parties, or where the appearance to the merits by both parties at the new trial might amount to a submission to the jurisiction — there being no limitations or restrictions upon the granting new trials by justices of the peace, where there has been a trial an jugment, an no power conferre except in the cases specifie of jugments of non suit or by efault, the assumption of such .a power in all cases woul be prouctive of the utmost confusion an uncertainty an might lea to gross abuses. The number of new trials, the causes for which they shoul be grante, the kin of notice to the opposite party, the time beyon which the magistrate shoul cease to have contrail over jugments renere by him, woul, as the law now stans, be left to the iscretion of a vast number of inferior courts, only quasi courts of recor, having no clerk, no seal, no perpetual succession or continuance of office, an without terms of fixe an limite uration.
In Kentucky an Iniana it seems that justices of the peace may grant new trials, Hotten vs. Greenwell, 4 Dana 633, where certain, limitations upon the power are prescribe. Robieau vs. Ewing, 5 Blackfiel, 552, where it appears to be expressly allow-, e by statute; an in that State justices’ courts are courts of recor. Hooker vs. The State, 7 ib. 272. An in Kentucky justices of the peace by statute have powers wholly unknown to our laws. Breckenrige vs. Coleman, 7 B. Monroe, 331, while in New York, an some other States, they are treate as jurisictions even more inferior an limite than with us.
But in Missouri, uner a system very similar to ours, the power of justices to grant new trials not being conferre by statute, is utterly enie. Cason vs. Tate, 8 Missouri, 45, referring to Downing vs. Gainer, 1 ib. 751, an Rutherfor vs. Winn, 3 ib. 14. So in Iowa, Helmich vs. Johnson, 1 Morris 89.
Our opinion is that if Walker, the efenant in the suit before the justice, was aggrieve by the ecision there, his appropriate remey was by appeal, an that all the proceeings of the-justice subsequent to the renition of the first jugment mentione in the pleaings were unauthorize by law.
This conclusion is not preicate upon any want of capacity-in justices of the peace to set asie the vericts of juries an grant new trials in causes pening before them, but upon the istinct groun that the Legislature, having the power to regulate the exercise of their jurisiction, intene, accoring to what seems to be the proper construction- of the statutes- on the subject, the trial e novo upon appeal as a substitute for the granting of new trials by the justices themselves.

elivere the opinion of the Court,
The appellant was inicte uner the statute for maiming one Jesse Ewars, the offence being a felony: The same statute, Digest, Title, Criminal Law. Part 4, Art. 3, Sec. 8, enacts “that if persons fight by mutual agreement, an one of them be maime, it shall not be eeme maiming within the meaning of this act; but the parties shall be punishe by fine an imprisonment as fin-an aggravate affray; which fine shall not exceeone thousan ollars, an the imprisonment shall not excee one year, at the iscretion of the court.” On the trial the verict was, “We the jury, o fin the within name John Strawn, not guilty, as charge in the within inictment, but fin that he an the within name Jesse Ewars fought by mutual agreement. By authority of the statute, Digest, Title, Criminal Proceeings, sec. 186, the court assesse the punishment to fifty ollars fine an imprisonment for one hour, an passe sentence accoringly. The prisoner move in arrest of jugment, because the verict, which acquitte him of the offence charge in the inictment, faile to show that he was guilty of any minor offence.
Certainly it might have been proper for the verict to have state more explicitly that the accuse was not guilty, as charge, of the offence of maiming, but that he an Ewars fought by mutual agreement, whereby the latter was maime. But looking at the inictment, the statute an the verict as returne, the conclusion is reasonable, if not unavoiable, that such was the meaning an intention of the jury; an although the verict oes not state, in express terms, that Ewars was maime, it will bear that construction, an was therefore sufficient to warrant the sentence. Uner the existing law, Revise Statutes, Title, Criminal Jurispruence, Division 3, Art. 5. See Eason vs. The State, 6 Eng. 502, an accuse convicte of an assault merely, with intent to commit certain felonies, incluing mayhem, might have been subjecte to an equally severe punishment by fine an imprisonment; an so for an aggravate assault: an for a simple assault, not attene with battery, the fine may be in any sum not exceeing one hunre ollars. Whatever might be the egree of strictness require in convictions for felony, we are not ispose to apply it to misemeanors after verict, an the present case is not stronger than that of McBrie vs. The State, 2 Eng. 374. The verict here was not a special one, which referring the law to the court, must state all the facts essential to a conviction; as for example, that the act suppose to constitute the felony, was one within the county, but was a general one, fining conclusions of law an fact, as will appear from the case of The Commonwealth vs. Call, 21 Pick, 514, cite for the appellant. The verict oes inee specially acquit the prisoner of the particular offence with which he is charge, but such acquittal, so far from vitiating the verict, or precluing the jury from proceeing to fin the lesser offence, in cases where it is allowable to o so, Cameron vs. The State, 4 Ark. 721, it is the proper form of returning the verict in such cases. 1 Chitty Crim.

It is argue here for the appellant that as the jury foun the accuse guilty of a misemeanor only, the verict shoul have state that such offence was committe-within a year previous to the fining of the inictment; else having pleae to an inictment for a felony, the limitation of which is three years, he might have been illegally convicte of a misemeanor, which for aught that appears, was barre by lapse of time. Though the better opinion woul seem to be that where an averment in an inictment as to time is not material, The People vs. Santvoor, 9 Cowen, 655, unless inee the averment be of an impossible ate, it is not require to be prove as lai, yet any question that might arise uner the statute, whether an inictment ought not to be quashe, or the jugment upon it arreste, where upon the face of the inictment, the offence of which the prisoner may be convicte appears to be barre, is obviate in this case, because here the offence is charge to have been committe within a year previous to the first fining of the inictment. The language of the statute is, “No person shall be trie, prosecute an punishe for any offence less than felony, unless the inictment be foun within one year after the commission of the offence.”. Our unerstaning is, that the uniform construction of the phraseology quote has been, that in orer to make out the offence the State is require to prove affirmatively, to the satisfaction of the jury, upon the issue to the plea of hot guilty, that the allege misemeanor was committe within a year previous to the fining of the inictment. Stevens vs. The State, 3 Ark. 66. Consequently, where the inictment alleging an offence within the year is goo on its face, if the proof at the trial iscloses an offence committe at some anterior time, the only way in which the prisoner can avail himself of the objection is, to bring it upon the •recor by exceptions; or it might be groun of motion for new trial; but woul not be available in arrest of jugment.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The inictment, preferre at the February term, 1853, of the Hot Spring Circuit Court, charge that the appellants, on the tenth ay of March, A. D. 1852, at&c., bet a certain sum of money at an unlawful game at cars calle raw pocre, then an there playe by them together. Asecon count allege the game playe to be calle pocre. On the trial the State prove that, at the August term 1852, an inictment which, leaving out of view any variance between them, the jury were authorize to .infer was for the same offence, was preferre against Jester, Reay, Morehea an one Cyrus A. Hale, charging that the games in question were playe by those four persons together, on the tenth ay of March, 1852. That Hale, having pleae guilty to that inictment at the February term, 1853, it was then, on motion of the attorney for the State, quashe as to the other efenants, Jester, Reay an Morehea. The parol testimony on the trial conuce to prove that uring the month of January, 1852, in the county of Hot Spring, these efenants ha bet money upon a game at cars calle pocre, then an there playe by them together with Hale an one Joshua F. Morris,, an that the witnesses for the prosecution ha so testifie before the gran jury, at each term of the court when the respective inictments were foun.
The efenants aske the court to instruct the jury, that in orer to convict upon an inictment for betting at cars, uner the 8th section of the statute against gaming, it is necessary -as part of the escription of the offence, to set out the names of the persons by whom the game was playe, if known to the gran jury, ap that the proof shoul correspon with the allegations in that respect. The refusal of the court to give this instruction an the omission to charge the jury in any manner equivalent to it, was clearly erroneous, accoring to the opinions of this court in Drew vs. The State, 5 Eng. 82. Parrott vs. The State, ib: 572. Moffat vs. The State, 6 ib. 169. Stith vs. The State, 13 Ark. 680, an Johnson vs. The State, ib. 684.
An objection was also taken an reserve to the sufficiency an legal effect of the recor evience auce to prove the penency of the former inictment, in orer to isplace the operation of the statute bar, suppose to appear on the face of the secon inictment, which charge the offence to have been committe more than a year previous to the time when it was preferre, An it was further objecte that the State coul not avail herself for this purpose of the recor of an inictment or prosecutipp pening an quashe at her own instance. The provision of the statute, Digest, Title, Criminal Proceeings, sec. 104, is “When any inictment or prosecution shall be quashe, set asie or reverse, the time uring which the same was pening, shall not be compute as part of the time of the limitation prescribe for the offence.” As the first inictment coul only have been quashe by the ecision of the court, the presumption is, that it was one, though on motion of the attorney for the State, for sufficient cause, in the exercise of juicial iscretion, an not capriciously, or with any esign to harrass the accuse, so that, although the quashal might operate as a harship, we cannot presume they yvere injure by it, because such a proceeing is a .contingency provie for by the statute an liable to occur in the aministration of justice.
Conceing that it was necessary for the State to prove that the offence, no matter when allege to have been committe, was in fact committe within a year previous to the fining of the inictment, (Strawn vs. The State, ecie at the present term), or to isplace the bar by showing, in accorance with the statute the penency an quashal of a former prosecution for the same offence, we might incline to the opinion, by parity of reasoning with the case of The State Bank vs. Gray, 7 Eng. 760, an The State Bank vs. Roy, ib. 766, that the recor of a former inictment against four persons might be amissible for that purpose on the trial of a subsequent inictment against any one or more of the same persons, an who might be separately inicte, provie the offence charge appeare to be in other respects the same, But the ifficulty here is, an it is, in a ifferent aspect, the same question presente by the motion to instruct the jury, that the secon inictment charges the games to have been playe by three persons, (the present appellants) while the recor auce in evience, isclose by the former inictment, a charge against them for betting at games playe by four persons — which being a istinct offence there was a material variance, for which the recor shoul have been exclue. If the secon inictment ha charge that these efenants bet at a game playe by them together with Hale, the question might have been analogous to The State Bank vs. Gray, an same vs. Roy, where the cause of action was the same, though all the efenants in the first suit were not embrace in the secon.
For these errors the jugment will be reverse an the cause remane with instructions to grant the motion of the efenants for a new trial, an that the cause be further proceee in accoring to law an not inconsistent with this opinion.-",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The appellant was inicte, trie, convicte an sentence to eath in the Inepenence Circuit Court for the murer of Hiram Payne, a white man. He appeale to this court, an his senténcé having been respite by the Circuit Court, uner the provisions of the statute, a sufficient time to allow him to make an application to a juge of this court for a suspension of his execution until his appeal coul be hear here, that orer was mae upon an inspection of a transcript of the recor an proceeings in accorance with his prayer.
From the bills of exceptions it appears that, on the ay before the killing, the appellant an his master, Benjamin Watson,ha a conversation, in which the slave talke improperly to his master,' an that at night when he returne from ploughing, he brought, a club in with him. That after supper he sat out upon the yar fence with the same in his han, an also picke up another stick, which he took to his quarters an set up at the oor, carrying the first name stick into the house. That in the course of the evening, an after supper, his master went into a room where the-school boys an hirelings were, whereupon the appellant left his own room an went to the chimney corner of the welling house. That about the mile of the night the appellant walke out into the yar carrying a fire torch, an the stick that he ha brought from the fiel, in his han. Upon returning to his quarters he tol his wife they were going to take him, but that he woul not be taken by bis master or any boy else, an that he woul knock the first man own that came into the room. ■ The next morning, the appellant went to mill an returne, an then bunle up his clothes an took them away. He then got some tubs, as he was orere to o, an went to the Woos for some hoop poles, as he was orere to o by a witness, who was oing some work for Watson, the master, an neee the hoop poles for the work in progress. It woul seem thats about this perio of time, Mrs. Watson, the wife of the master, ha sent a message to her husban, who was at the school house, to the effect that the appellant ha run away, an it appearing that while Watson, the master, was on the way from the school house to his welling, whither he was going in consequence of receiving such a message from his wife, he met the appellant coming from the woos with some hoop poles an an axe in his hans. It appears that then “Watson an others avance towars the (appellant) at the request of Watson, an for the purpose, as expresse by Mr. Watson of correcting” him. Who these others were an how they happene to be with Watson oes not appear. It appears, however, that when Watson an these others approache to the appellant, that he retreate, but that they overlook him in the roa an orere him to lay own his axe, an he refuse, an sai that he woul not be w’hippe by Watson, or any boy else, an that he woul kill the first man that attempte to take him, an that he then walke on, an Watson an the men after him. In a short time he stoppe again an was conversing with Watson, but what was sai oes not appear. At this point of time “Hiram Payne, the slain, walke rapily by the witness, from behin the witness, being behin the boy an the company, having in his hans a piece of pine plank. That Payne, the ecease, walke irectly up to Watson an Austin, the appellant, an rew his stick upon Austin. That Austin stoo with his axe rawn as Payne rew his stick upon Austin. That Austin ware off the blow of Payne with his left arm, an with his right struck Payne with the axe. That Payne was hit with the whole ege of the axe on his hea, the cut penetrating to the brain, an that Payne ie the Saturay afterwars.”
Upon the trial so much of the evience was objecte to as relate to matters that transpire the ay before the homipie, upon the groun of its isconnection with that principal fact, an irreleyan cy to the issue. It is certainly true as a general rule, both in civil an criminal cases, that the evience must be confine to the point in issue; an in criminal cases there is perhaps a greater necessity, if possible, than in civil proceeings to enforce the rule: but in neither class of cases oes this rule exclue all evience that oes not bear irectly upon the issue; on the contrary, all evience is amissible which tens to prove it, an no facts are forbien to be shown, except such as are incapable of afforing any reasonable presumption or inference in eluciation of the matters involve in the issue. In this case the line of efence taken, an which the State ha the right to anticipate, was that the homicie amounte to no more than manslaughter. The presen ce or absence of malice was therefore an essential matter of enquiry. To establish it the State was not boun to rely exclusively upon the malice that the law presumes from the killing, an the eviences of it which were otherwise shown by the circuriistances at the point of time when the killing occurre, but ha the right to a any other evience, as former gruges, former threats, previous lying in wait, cumulative of the former, an • thus effectually to repel any inferences that might be rawn in favor of the efence from the circumstances that transpire at the time of the killing. In like manner, anteceent facts an circumstances, from which any reasonable presumption coul arise, or inference be rawn, that the course of conuct pursue by the prisoner at the time of the killing ha been previously premeitate an resolve upon by him, in reference to a probable effort to bring him back into perfect suborination to the lawful authority of his master, although without any reference to the particular iniviual slain, tene at once, not only to eluciate the intention of the slave at the’time of striking the fatal blow, but the state an conition of his heart, both as to evil esign in general, an in being resolve, in pursuance of the ictates of such wicke, eprave an malignant evil esign in general, to o the particular, unlawful act of resisting the rightful authority of his master at all hazars, incluing that of taking human life in general, regarless of social uty an without respect to persons.
Such a resolye, prompte by the ictates of such a heart, coul not be otherwise, than essentially malicious, an if in being acte out, human life was taken, although uner circumstances which, isconnecte with such resolve, might lay grouns for presumptions that the slayer was actuate by a esign to save his own life, or was prompte by circumstances transpiring at the time strongly calculate to excite the passions of terror an resentment, it coul not be otherwise than a legitimate point of enquiry by the jury, whether or not the homicie ha been really superinuce by the former, although apparently by the latter, to the en that the presumption in favor of manslaughter might be legitimately overslaughe by these cumulative presumptions of malice.
. It is in this point of view that we think the jury in this case ha the right to consier an weigh the evience objecte to. They ivere sitting in jugment upon an act which, in point of law, was to be essentially characterize by the motive of the heart which prompte it. These in the orer of Provience are hien an beyon the reach of human law, until evelope by acts of commission, or of omission, which present them to its jugment in etermining the quality of the act brought in question. Every act then of either class, which in the range of probability coul cast a ray of light upon the motive, which prouce the homicie in question, was legitimately within the range of the investigation, although occurring at an anteceent time, or at another place unless forbien by the rule esigne to confine the investigation to the issue mae; an this rule, as we have seen, oes not exclue any evience that tens to prove or eluciate any of the matters involve in the issue. An regaring the evience objecte to in this case as of that character, we think the court below properly allowe it to go to the jury.
The secon bill of exceptions raises the question, whether or not the confessions of the accuse, being otherwise unexceptionable in point of law, can be allowe to be prouce in evience after the facts themselves have been proven by witnesses who were present when they transpire. We think it perfectly clear that they may, being both of the same grae of evience, although iffering in the weight to be given to them by the jury.
In the thir, it is amitte that it was shown that the confessions were obtaine without the prisoner having been promise or threatene in any way, an that there was no inucement ,or reason hel out to him to- answer the question propoune by one of his guars “what he ha against the ecease to inuce him to strike him,” or otherwise to talk upon the subject. But it is insiste, as the confessions were so mae in response to that question, which it is urge implie the guilty act of the prisoner, an was mae to one of his guar at a time when he was in chains an being brought to jail upon the charge in question, that they ought to have been exclue from the jury. In Mr. Greenleaf’s work on evience the law upon this subject is thus state: “Though it is necessary to the amissibility of a confession that it shoul have been voluntarily mae, that is, that it shoul have been mae, as before shown, without the appliances of hope or fear from persons having authority, yet it is not necessary that it shoul have been the prisoner’s own spontaneous act. It will be receivable though it were inuce by spiritual exhortations, whether of a clergyman or any other person; by solemn promise of secrecy, even confirme by an- oath, or by reason of the prisoner’s having been runk, or by some collateral benefit or boon-, no hope or favor having been hel out in respect to the criminal charge against him, or by any eception practice on the prisoner or false representation mae to him for that purpose, provie there is no reason to suppose that the inucement hel out was calculate to prouce any untrue confession, which is the main point to be consiere. So, a confession is amissible though it is elicite by questions, whether put to a prisoner by a magistrate, officer or private person, an the form of the question is immaterial to the amissibility, even though it assumes the prisoner’s guilt, In all these cases the evience may be lai before the jury, however little it may weigh uner the circumstances, an however reprehensible may be the moe in which, in some of them, it was obtaine.” (1 Greenl. Ev. part 2, ch. 12, sec. 229, p. 293, 5 eition.)
Although in some few of the cases state in this text, we woul look closely to the authorities, upon which they are base, before eclaring the law to the full extent that they are state to go, we can have no hesitancy, on the question before us now, in holing that the objection taken was not goo.
The fourth bill of exceptions presents a question of practice in this wise. The name of Benjamin Watson, the master of the prisoner, was enorse upon the inictment as a witness; he was summone as such for the State, was in attenance upon the trial, an with the other State’s witnesses was sworn in chief, but he was not interrogate or put upon the stan by the State as a witness. The prisoner claime the right to cross-examine him upon the whole case, an relie upon the English practice. The court overrule his motion. Upon an examination of the authorities, we think that the ecie preponerance in the American courts, is in favor of confining the right of cross-examination to those facts an circumstances only, connecte with the matters actually state in the irect examination of a witness; an that if the cross-examining party wishes to examine the witness as to other matters, he must o so by making the witness his own-, an calling him as such in the subsequent progress of the case (1 Greenl. Ev. part 3, ch. 3, sec. 445, p. 562.)
The fifth bill of exceptions presents the question whether the owner of a slave is a competent witness in a prosecution involving the life of the slave. In this case he was offere as a witness on the part of the prisoner; the State objecte because of his pecuniary interest as owner, an the court sustaine the objection. This question first was iscusse in North Carolina, in a case where a master refuse to testify against his slave, an on error his appeal was sustaine, but the court, in the iscussion lai great stress upon the fact of general incompetency,-because of the law of that State, which mae the master substantially a party to the recor, by reason of the provision for a jugment of ¡costs against him upon the conviction of his slave. (State vs. Charity, 2 Dev. Rep. 543). In that case, however, Chief Justice Henerson elivere a separate opinion from the majority of the court, an foreshaowe the principles which have since been recognize an aopte in some of the other slave States. He sai, “ My concurrence in the opinion of the court, in excluing the master on the groun of interest, is so feeble that it almost amounts to a issent. Where pecuniary interest only is at stake, to exclue a witness on the score of interest, however small, is applying a scale of morality to our nature sufficiently humiliating. But when the life or eath of a fellow being is to be the result of the trial, to exclue a witness because he may have a pecuniary interest, either in preserving or taking the life of the accuse, is attributing to us, frail as we know ourselves to be, more epravity than we are willing, I think, to amit. The rule, as lai own by the court, as I unerstan it, exclues the master on the same groun, that of interest, in becoming a witness for his slave; for the rule must be mutual. If he cannot be compelle to give evience against his slave, because of his interest, he cannot, even if he is willing, give evience for him on the same groun. I shoul rather suppose that the interest at stake, being so entirely ifferent from that which is orinarily brought forwar to protect a witness from giving evience, orto exclue him> if willing, that it is not to be weighe in the same balances with mere pecuniary interest. It is so transcenant in its nature that its weight is not to be ascertaine by mere money balances.”
The same question afterwars arose in Tennessee, in a case where, like in this before us, the master’s evience ha been rejecte by the Circuit Court, on the groun of interest. The court reverse the jugment for that error, an in elivering its opinion, by Reese, J., sai: “ But it is sai the Circuit Court erre in rejecting the master of the slave when offere as a witness in his favor, on the groun of his incompetency from pecuniary interest. An of this opinion are the court. A father has an interest, which may be valuable, in the services of his minor son, yet it is not questione that he can be a witness for or against him on a charge affecting his life. A master may have a pecuniary interest in the future labor an services of his apprentice, much exceeing, it may be in a few pursuits, the entire value of his slave: yet perhaps it has never occurre to any one that the master is incompetent to testify on behalf of the apprentice in a matter affecting his life. The relation of master an slave is inee ifferent; but in a case like this, the law, upon high grouns of public policy, pretermits for a moment that relation, takes the slave out of the hans of his master, forgets his claims an rights of property,” — as in the case, the juge might have ae, where the trespass for killing a slave is merge into the felony, an prohibits the recovery of the money value of the slave until the slayer has been first trie uner an inictment for the felony. (3 Porter Ala. Rep. 424)—“treats the slave as a rational an intelligent human being, responsible to moral, social an municipal uties an obligations an gives him the benefit of all the forms of trial which jealousy of power an love of liberty have inuce a freeman to throw aroun himself for his own protection. If thep the master knows any fact tening to save the life of the slave, shall society, who have taken from him the slave for the purpose of trial, say to him, not that you are master, an we will weigh your creit, but you are master an shall not speak at all! On grouns of public policy, of common humanity, of absolute necessity, the master must be hel to be competent as a witness for or against the slave. Society will not allow him to say, I have a pecuniary interest in the event of the trial, my testimony may subject me to a loss, an I will not testify against my slave. On the other han, humanity forbis that society shoul say, you have such an interest an shall not be hear to prove a fact in his favor. In cases where one slave may kill another, the master may often be the only person cognizant of his guilt, or the only person who can establish his innocence. Shall he refuse to speak in the one case, lest he incur a loss? Shall his lips be seale in the other, because he has an interest? Public policy an common humanity eclare the necessity of so treating this relation that the guilty shoul not escape punishment, or the ipnocent be mae to suffer.” (Elijah vs. The State, 1 Humph. R. 102.)
Afterwars, in the year 1841, a case raising the same question was brought before the High Court of Errors an Appeals in Mississippi. That also was a case where the master of the slave was offere as a witness for him in the Circuit Court, an that court refuse to allow him to testify, on the groun of interest; an for this error the Court of Errors reverse the jugment, an Chief Justice Sharkey, after approving the opinion of the court in Tennessee, which we have cite, as “base upon soun an humane principles” an recognizing the analogy to the case of master an apprentice, on the score of interest, then, in treating the question as one of public policy an common humanity, remarks as follows: “The master has the custoy of his slave an owes to him protection, an it woul be a rigorous rule inee if the master coul not be a witness in behalf of his slave 1 What woul be the conition of the slave, if the rule which bins him to perpetual servitue, shoul also create such an interest in the master as to eprive him of the testimony of that master? The harships of such a rule will illy comport with that humanitjr which shoul be extene to that race of people. In prosecutions for offences, negroes are to be treate as other persons: an although the master may have ha an interest in his servant, yet the servant ha such an interest in the testimony of his master as will outweigh mere pecuniary consierations, nor can he be eprive of the benefit of that testimony by the mere circumstance that in a civil point of view he was regare by the law as property.” Isham vs. The State, 6 How. (Miss.) R. 35.)
Recognizing these principles of law, public policy an common humanity, thus so aptly presente, as clearly soun, we aopt them without hesitancy, as the true exposition of the point of law in question, an therefore think it clear that the Circuit Court erre in refusing to allow Watson, the master, to testify when offere as a witness on the part of his slave, Austin, the appellant; holing that the matter of Watson’s pecuniary interest lay to his creibility only an not to his competency as a witness.
The remaining question relates to so much of the charge of the court as was objecte to an save in the sixth bill of exceptions. That was, “That if the jury shoul fin that the efenant was in rebellion to the authority of his master, Payne ha a right to take the efenant an to use such force as was necessary to take him, an that if the efenant then attacke Payne an slew him, he was guilty of murer, an his offence coul not be reuce to manslaughter, even although the striking of the efenant by Payne woul have been evience to show an extenuation of the killing of Payne by the efenant from murer to manslaughter, if the slave ha not been at fault in acting in rebellion to the authority of his master.”
From the face of this recor we cannot say that this charge is too latituinous an unqualifie, because the bills of exception neither purport to save all the evience prouce on the trial of the cause, nor all to which the charge was applicable, so as- to exclue any presumption in favor of the charge, that other evience in support of it might have been prouce. But without any regar to this consieration, we are free to say, that the tranquility of the public at large, the security of the master, the value of the slave as property, an the just protection an comfort of the slave himself, all epen so essentially upon his entire suborination to the lawful authority of his master, that we woul hesitate long before we woul eclare otherwise than that the principle, lai own in this charge, was any other than a soun general principle of the common law of slavery, as it exists in our slave States. In preserving this lawful suborination, upon which the best interests of the community, of the master, an of the slave, so raically epen, every citizen in common with the master, has an abiing interest. An when a slave is in rebellion to the lawful authority of his master, whatever force may be necessary to bring him within the pale of suborination, grauate upon principles of law an humanity, let it tcome from what quarter it may, invaes no right of the slave, an consequently oes him no such wrong as the law can recognize as a mitigation or excuse for crime. (Jacob vs. The State, 3 Humph. R. 493.)
For the error of the court below in refusing to allow Watson, the master, to testify, when offere as a witness on the part of the appellant, the jugment must be reverse an the cause remane to be proceee with to another trial an jugment.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the court.
A serious objection exists to the jugment of May, 1848, which forbis us giving it.sanctity or effect. The act of the Legislature of 7th January, 1843', authorizing the Circuit Courts to recall jugments on elivery bons, was pronounce unconstitutional an voi by this court, in Byr vs. Brown, 5 Ark. 710, chiefly on the groun that the General Assembly possesse no power to authorize a Circuit Court to revise its own jugments- renere at a previous term. Nothing nee be ae to the reasoning in that case, because if any proposition is self-evient, it is, that if the Legislature can confer on the Circuit Courts authority to revise one class of erroneous jugments, the same power may be conferre in all cases, an thus effectually eprive this tribunal of its appellate jurisiction grante by the Constitution. This cannot be one, an hence recalling the previous jugment an entering jugment anew on the elivery bon, were proceeings coram non juice; an consequently the execution which issue on this new jugment, the levy on lans, their appraisement an offer for sale, were mere nullities, an must fall with the jugment, because no vali thing can spring from a voi thing. An this brings us to the first jugment on the elivery bon renere in 1842. It was taken on mere motion, without process or notice, without etailing the facts otherwise than in the jugment itself, an was unoubtely so erroneous, as to have been reversible on error, in a irect proceeing for that purpose, if that remey ha been sought by either party. It was, however, voiable merely, not voi; an accoring to the octrine in Boren vs. The State, 6 Eng. 519, must be regare by this court as a vali jugment, since the court pronouncing it was a superior court in contemplation of law, an ha jurisiction over the subject matter. There is then no alternative but to treat it as a bining jugment.
The attempt of the same court at a subsequent term to recall it ha no effect on it whatever. Fellows vs. Griffin, 9 Smees & Marsh. 362. Dow vs. Hunt, 11 Sm. & Marsh. 417.
An it may be remarke, that in aition to the unconstitutionality of the law above allue to, the court, on general principles, ha no power to set asie its own jugments after the term ha passe, inasmuch as jurisiction over the subject matter ha been exhauste, an to assume it again woul be the same, in its effect, as acting in a case where there was an entire want of jurisiction. This octrine has been approve by this court in the cases of Ashley vs. Hye, 1 Eng. 100; Cossitt vs. Biscoe, 7 Eng. 95, an Rawon vs. Rapley, 14 Ark., an has become the settle law of this tribunal.
The execution which issue on the original jugment was levie on two slaves as the property of Naborne T. Nelson, one of the efenants, on the 27th of November, 1841, an were restore to his possession, upon his giving a elivery bon, signe by all the efenants in the original jugment, with Ambrose K. Ellett as security, an this bon was forfeite an jugment renere on it, as state, in 1842, for the whole ebt; the slaves levie on having been of that value. The question then is irectly presente as to the effect of a levy an elivery bon on the original jugment, an the ifference between a simple forfeiture not pursue to jugment an an actual jugment on the elivery bon. An to a proper unerstaning of the subject in all its bearings, it will be necessary to avert to the previous an present law concerning elivery bons, noting such ifferences as may exist, but still regaring those laws as forming one system, accoring to the ancient rule of exposition, that acts in pari materia are to be construe together.
As a system it is sui generis, an has affore a fruitful fiel of litigation for more than ten years, an it woul seem to be high time that something shoul be settle with regar to it. The counsel of the appellants have well sai it is a “vexe question,” an although we might evae, yet we think it more compatible with uty to meet an ecie it. s
1.. An first as to a levy on personal property.
A levy on personal property belonging to the efenant, to an amount equal to the ebt, is a temporary satisfaction of the jugment. But if the' property is frauulently withrawn by the efenant, or by his procurement or agency from the custoy of the officer, or the efenant by his own act procures the release of the levy an the property comes again to his possession, it oes not amount to satisfaction. Ontario Bank vs. Hallet, 8 Cow. 194. Mickles vs. Haskin, 11 Wen. 126. Green vs. Burke, 23 Wen. 490. Ostraner vs. Walter, 2 Hill 331. Piper vs Elwoo, 4 Denio 165. McGinnis vs. Sillar’s Ex’r, 4 Bibb 490. Morrow vs. Hart, 1 A. K. Marshall 292. Porter vs. Boone, 1 Watts & Serg. 251. The People vs. Hopson, 1 Denio 578. Peck vs. Tiffany, 2 Comstock 456.
An this octrine, so conformable to justice an common sense, an so abunantly sustaine by the best authorities, has been sanctione by this court in cases running through a series of years, from the organization of the court to the present time. Walker vs. Braley, 2 Ark. 578. Caule vs. Dare, 2 Eng. 46. Sullivan vs. Pearce, 5 Eng. 500. Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe, 7 Eng. 548. Kelly vs. Garvin, 7 Eng. 617. In the late case of Trapnall vs. Richarson, 13 Ark. 550, it was sai that “the law is unerstoo by the court to be, that a levy on personal property is a satisfaction while the property remains in legal custoy, but is not a satisfaction where the property is restore to the ebtor, or in any manner gets back to his possession, or when the levy being exhauste by the sale, fails to prouce satisfaction. In any such case the plaintiff is entitle to have further execution, an when the levy has been exhauste by sale, it is a satisfaction pro tanto, an execution will be ha for the resiue.”
By the term levy, as use in this connection, must be unerstoo, an act of seizure, which eprives the ebtor of the possession of his property, or in other wors, places it in the custoy of the law to meet the ebt, since it woul be monstrous to hol that a mere levy on personal property, without regar to the fact that the ebtor was eprive of it, shoul work a satisfaction either temporary or absolute; for in such a case the hans of the plaintiff might be tie, while the efenant was in the actual enjoyment of the property.1 This woul be intolerable.
It has unoubtely been lai own in some books, that the efenants’ property is altere by a seizure'in execution, an that thereby the ebtor loses his goos. To that effect is the ancient case of Clerke vs. Withers, 1 Salk. 323, reporte also in 6 Moern 293, an other cases which have followe it. In that case, Powell, J., sai: “the property, by the execution, is out of the efenant, whose goos they were.” Expressions of a similar import are ascribe to Lor Kelyng in 1 Levinz 282, to Lor Holt in Holt’s Reports 647, an to Moreton, J., in 1 Moern Reports 31. An in La vs. Blunt, 4 Mass. 403, Chief Justice Parsoxs, aopting that octrine, sai that by a lawful seizure, the ebtor lost his property in the goos. Inee the rule, that a levy is an absolute satisfaction, can rest on no other groun, an wherever it has been maintaine, it has been on the authority alone of Clerke vs. Withers, as will be perceive by reference to the cases, Denton vs. Livingston, 9 Johns. 98. Hoyt vs. Huson, 12 Johns. 208. But that octrine is not correct, an has been effectually exploe. The officer by the seizure acquires a special property connecte with the possession, an on that may maintain trespass or trover against any person who takes the goos away before the levy is legally ispose of. Willbrahan vs. Snow, 2 Saun. 47 an note c. 7 Term Rep. 398. But the general property in the goos remains in the ebtor, notwithstaning the seizure. An this L; warrante even by the ol cases. Shelton’s case, Dyer 67, b. n. Milton vs. Eerington, Dyer 99 a.
In 1 Brownlow 41, it is sai, “if the sheriff shall by virtue of a fi. fa. levy the ebt an amages of a man, an make return that the goos remain in his hans for want of buyers, the property remains still in the efenant, although-the sheriff hath possession of the goos.” In Waller vs. Weeale, Noy’s Rep. 107, the jugment ebtor supporte etinue against a sheriff, who ha returne that he mae the levy an ha the goos but ha not sol them. The court hel that the sheiiff coul not keep the goos an pay the ebt with his own money. It woul be ifficult to account for this jugment, if the ebtor ha lost his property in the goos by the seizure. Justice Powell, in 6 Mo. 293, amits that if by any accient the execution etermines, the ebtor shall have his goos again. In Ayre vs. Aen, Yelv. 44, it is sai that by “seizing the goos the owner’s property is not altere.” Lor Harwicks observe in Lowthall vs. Tonkins, 2 Eq. Cas. Abr. 381, that the property of the goos continues in the efenant until execution execute; which means until the sale of the goos. Thompson vs. Clerke, Cro. Eliz. 504. Shallcomb vs. Cross, 1 L. Raym. 251. Cooper vs. Chitty, 1 Burr. 30. Payne vs. Dreeve, 4 East. 523.
American ecisions may be foun in abunance to the same effect. Thus in Sa vs. North, 2 Mass. 517, Parsons, C. J., says that the special property of the sheriff is efeasible by the efenant’s paying the execution in money, before the sale of the goos. In Blake vs. Shaw, 7 Mass. 500, an Luen vs. Leavitt, 9 Mass. 105, it was hel that the general property in goos is not change until a levy an sale by execution; or in technical language, until execution execute, Catlin vs. Jackson, 8 Johns. 548. It was never suppose that the property in an estray, or in goos istraine was lost or altere by the seizure; nor that goos pawne with a limite time for reemption, cease to be the property of the pawnor. Yet in each of these instances, there is an inchoate act which reners the property liable to be altere an lost by the negligence, or inability of the owner; but it may be save by his seasonable interposition. This is the true state of property seize on afi.fa. an in legal custoy.
It is perfectly clear, on both authority an principle, that the sheriff' only acquires a special property in the goos by the seizure; the jugment creitor none at all, an that the general property remains in the ebtor, until sale uner execution.
A mere levy then on personal property, without anything more, oes not ivest the title of the ebtor, nor change it, nor oes the levy amounts,to satisfaction, as before observe, 5 Eng. 502. The true rule is, that satisfaction takes place only when the execution has been so use as to change the title, or in some other way eprive the ebtor of his property, to the amount of the jugment.
This inclues the case of a levy an sale, an also the loss or estruction of the goos, otherwise than by the act of Go, an without fault or misconuct on the part of the ebtor. It oes not ivest a title, but only creates a lien on the property. The levy may be overreache by some paramount lien or be efeate by the act or misconuct of the ebtor, or become entirely ineffectual in consequence of the property coming again to his possession an use, as upon giving a elivery bon. Another instance may be given. The iea of satisfaction rests on the main groun that the ebtor is eprive of a sufficiency of property belonging to him to ischarge the ebt, an although the presumption is, that property seize belongs to the efenant, yet, if in point of fact, the contrary is true, an he has no' interest in it subject to execution, the levy, so far from being even a temporary satisfaction, can have no effect at all, because the ebtor is eprive of nothing, an is not injure by a levy on property not belonging to him, an of course can erive no benefit from it. On no principle of law or reason can the seizure of property of one person satisfy an execution against another, 8 Cowen 194, 21 Wen. 607, 28 Wen. 609. In these an other cases falling within a like principle, there is no color for saying the jugment is satisfie or affecte. The case of The People vs. Hopson, 1 Denio 578, is a ecisive authority to sustain these positions an was cite with approbation by this court in Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe, 7 Eng. 548, an Kelly vs. Garvin, 7 Eng. 617, in both of which cases it was explicitly announce as a fixe rule, that a mere levy on sufficient personal property of a efenant, without anything more, never amounte to the satisfaction of a jugment, an that the only effect was, that so long as the property remaine in legal custoy, the other remeies of the creitor woul be suspene. In Peck vs. Tiffany, 2 Coms. 450, the court oí appeals of New York, use this language, “There are some ol cases in which icta are foun that a levy on sufficient personal property to satisfy an execution, is a satisfaction; but that octrine has been long since exploe Where a sheriff levies on sufficient personal property, an through his negligence or misconuct it is lost, estroye, or otherwise ispose of, so that the efenant is eprive of the benefit of it, there is no oubt it shoul be regare as a satisfaction of the execution an the plaintiff must seek his remey against the sheriff. But where the ebtor has neither pai the ebt, nor been eprive of his property, the simple act of levying upon it, is not a satisfaction, whether the ebtor has been permitte to retain the property, either by his own misconuct, or by his request, or the voluntary act of the officer, because neither work any wrong to him.” The court cite Greene vs. Burke, 23 Wen. 496. Ostraner vs. Walter, 2 Hill 231. Taylor vs. Rauney, 4 Hill 621. Voorhees vs. Gross, 3 How. Pr. Rep. 262.
An this court, in Sullivan vs. Pierce, 5 Eng. 502, sai that a mere levy on property i not constitute satisfaction.
Now satisfaction epens on two things ; first, on the fact that a sufficiency of property belonging to the efenant, has been seize to meet the ebt; an secon, that the ebtor is eprive of it. An even then the satisfaction is temporary, not absolute, subsisting only as long as the property remains in legal custoy, an hence this court, in the case in 5 Eng. 502, correctly remarke, that the greatest extent, to which the authorities ha gone, ha been that where property was taken in execution, an remaine in the hans of the officer unsol, it might be consiere as a temporary satisfaction, to the extent that it must be ispose of before other property can be taken in execution. The effect of the levy in that case was hel to be estroye by the return of the property to the efenant on the orer of the plaintiff, an which left the latter perfectly free to procee on the jugment.
In Dugan vs. Fowler, 14 Ark., this court sai it ha been repeately hel that, an existing unsatisfie levy on property, suffi■cient in value to satisfy the jugment, is a satisfaction, but not an absolute satisfaction in any event; that it must epen on circumstances connecte with the future isposition of the levy, whether it is an absolute satisfaction or not; that the cases of Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe, an Trapnall vs. Richarson, ha settle the general principle that a subsisting unischarge levy upon property sufficient to satisfy the jugment, is a satisfaction until, by the ischarge of the levy by sale or otherwise, it proves to be partial or incomplete. It is almost superfluous to remark, that a levy is ischarge or legally ispose of by giving a elivery bon, to retain the possession of the property. It is no longer in legal custoy an the levy oes not subsist for any purpose whatever.
As before intimate, it must be unerstoo that if on a juicial sale the property in the hans of the officer proves insufficient, the jugment with all its consequences subsists in full force as to the balance of the ebt; because pai'tial payment can never extinguish an entire eman, an the plaintiff is in no fault, because the property oes not bring the whole ebt. 4 Denio 167.
We think it must be regare as a settle an inflexible rule in this State, that a jugment is neither satisfie nor affecte when the property seize is frauulently withrawn by the efenant or his procurement or agency from the custoy of the officer; or the efenant by his own act, as giving a elivery bon, procures its release, an it comes again to his possession an resumes its place among the mass of his property, or the property seize oes not belong to the efenant. In such cases the jugment woul not only maintain its vitality against the efenant, but its priority as to other jugment creitors; because the plaintiff has lost no lien by tampering with the levy; nor his priority by any agreement to release property; nor are his rights postpone or suspene by any act he has one, Greene vs. Burke, 23 Wen. 501. An cases falling within a like principle woul necessarily be governe by the same rules.
We have sai this much as to the effect of a levy on personal property, an how it may be ischarge, because it was a necessary part of our inquiry, an for the further reason that some misapprehension seeme to exist with regar to it- As to this branch of the subject it only remains to say that the octrine announce is consiere to be just to both ebtor an creitor; to the former, because protecting him from the oppression of a further levy, when suflicient property of his remains in the custoy of the law to prouce satisfaction; to the latter, because preserving to him rights not yiele, an appropriately rewaring his vigilance in their prosecution.
2. As to the ejject of a elivery bon on the jugment.
A elivery bon, uner the law as it existe in the Revise Statutes, was require to be given to the plaintiff in ouble the value of the property seize in execution, with sufficient security to be approve by the officer. But on forfeiture it i not have the force an .effect of a jugment, nor coul execution be issue against all the obligors, as is the case at present. Rev. Stat. 380; Digest 501, 502. It was intene for the ease an favor of the ebtor, an forme a part of that system of legislative relief peculiar to some of the western an southern States, an which, jn its practical operation, is believe in mosteases to have prove etrimental to both the ebtor an creitor.
Uner the present law, no matter what the value of the property levie on is, the bon must secure the whole “ebt, amages, interest an costs,” an on forfeiture, execution issues on the statutory jugment, against all the obligors, for the whole amount upai, Digest 502. An in view of this new feature we think, when the bon is returne forfeite, the clerk shoul in all cases note it on his jugment ocket, setting forth the names of the obligors, the ate of the forfeiture, an fhe amount of the ebt, amages an costs, as in the case of jugments formally renere in the Circuit Court, to the en that recor evience may exist; an the utmost publicity be given to a proceeing which, on a fair construction of our law, must necessarily operate as a lien on the real estate of the obligors in the county from the ate of the forfeiture, Digest 626. The statute respecting the lien of jugments .an ecrees oes in spirit, although not in letter, embrace such cases, an the establishment of the rule is only carrying out what the Legislature must have intene, because otherwise the creitor might be place in a worse situation than he was in before, an lose important rights without an equivalent.
The elivery bon uner the previous law, affore a cumulative remey merely, of which the plaintiff might avail himself at his election. He was not oblige to o so, but coul procee on the original jugment, which was neither satisfie, extinguishe, nor affecte by the taking an forfeiture of the bon.
By electing however, to procee on it to jugment, either in a summary manner by motion or by an orinary suit, the effect coul not be otherwise than to extinguish the previous jugment; because the creitor not only ha a new one, but aitional security, thus resembling in some respects accor an satisfaction. Pope vs. Tunstall, 2 Ark. 209. By thus proceeing, the plaintiff virtually accepte the new jugment in lieu of the original, an coul not, on well establishe principles of law, resort to the latter to obtain satisfaction of the ebt. An it followe as a necessary consequence, that all liens arising uner the original jugment or executions issue on it were release, or in other wors, such liens, the real jugment, an the elivery bon itself, on which the new' jugment was base, were all merge in such new jugment. 4 Bac. Abr. D. 149.
An the recourse of the plaintiff was from thenceforwar against the parties on the new jugment. In Pury vs. Doyle, 1 Paige 561, it was hel that where a creitor obtaine a lien upon real estate by a jugment, an subsequently brought an action of ebt on that jugment, an recovere a new one, the lien of the first jugment was lost. This is what Chief Justice Marshall in The Unite States vs. Graves, 2 Brock. 385, calle “a technical satisfaction” of the previous jugment. When the plaintiff electe to procee, an by his own voluntary act substitute the new for the original jugment, the case then stoo on the same footing as it oes in those States where the law accors to a forfeite elivery bon, the force an effect of a jugment, an on which an execution issues as a matter of right without further proceeings. Our present law concerning elivery bons erive its main features from Virginia. Kentucky an Mississippi rew their law on this subject from the same fountain hea. The ecisions in those States, as to the proper construction an effect of this law, are entitle to great respect an shoul weigh heavily in arriving at a proper conclusion, although not absolutely bining on this court. In Virginia, if. a forthcoming bon is forfeite the execution is at an en, because the forfeiture ha the effect of a jugment, an execution issue against all the obligors on this statutory or constructive jugment. Lusk vs. Ramsey, 3 Munf. 433. Cooke vs. Piles, 4 Munf. 153. The bon there covere the whole ebt, regarless of the value of the property levie on, an on forfeiture ha the effect of a jugment by express statute. 8 Hen. Stat. 326, 327. An the forthcoming bon was no satisfaction of a jugment until forfeiture. 3 Munf. 454. In the case above cite in 2 Brock. 385, Chief Justice Marshall, in reviewing the ecisions of the courts of Virginia, sai: “They have unoubtely etermine that a forthcoming bon when forfeite, is a satisfaction of the jugment on which the execution issue, an that no further proceeings can be foune on that jugment. The forthcoming bon is substitute for the jugment, an the recourse of the plaintiff is against the parties to that bon.” An so a replevy bon in Virginia extinguishe the jugment, for the reason that by statute the creitor approve the security, an the bon, as soon as execute, ha the force of a jugment for the whole ebt, an execution issue against all the obligors without any further proceeings. 3 Munf. 449; an it was sai to be “as complete an execution of the jugment as if the estate of the efenant ha been sol to the full amount of the ebt, an the party was left to pursue his own remey upon the bon.” Taylor vs. Dunass, 1 Wash. 96.
In Mississippi, the law of Virginia having been, as alreay state, substantially aopte, a forthcoming bon covere the whole ebt an ha the force an effect of a jugment when forfeite, How. & Hutch. Stat. 653. No juicial action was necessary to prouce that result, an execution issue on this statutory as upon any other jugment. Miner vs. Lancashire, 4 How. Miss. R. 350. Wanzee vs. Barker, ib. 369. Saners vs. McDowell, ib. 9. Unite States Bank vs. Patton, 5 How. Miss. R. 200. McNutt vs. Wilcox, 3 How. Miss. R. 419. Annis vs. Smith, 16 Peters 304. Brown vs. Clarke, 4 How. S. C. R. 12.
An so effectual is this satisfaction, that after a elivery bon taken an forfeite, a secon execution, levy an bon on the original jugment are utterly voi, an it was so expressly hel in Witherspoon vs. Spring, 3 How. Miss. R. 60. The original jugment being entirely extinguishe coul only be revive by the quashal of the bon; until which time its lien was gone, an all levies mae uner it were release. “The forfeiture of the bon,” says the court, in 3 How. 419, “extinguishes or satisfies, as it is sai, the original jugment; because it is a proceeing arising on it, an has in itself the force an effect, an is of equal ignity with a jugment, an a plaintiff is not entitle to two subsisting jugments on the same cause of action against the same iniviuals. It is like a secon jugment, obtaine by an action on the first; the plaintiff cannot procee to enforce the first, but must rely on the secon.” 4 Bac. Abr. D. 149. Again in Clarke vs. Anerson, 2 How. Miss. R. 853, it was sai that the forthcoming bon after forfeiture becomes, by operation of law, a jugment, an necessarily extinguishes the former jugment, because two jugments are'not allowe at the same time, against the same person on the same cause of action.” An in Burns vs. Stanton, 2 S. & M. 461, it was ecie that the original jugment after the forfeiture of the bon, was no longer in existence. An it has been further hel, that as the forfeiture of a forthcoming bon is a satisfaction of the original jugment, the lien of it is extinguishe an a new lien commences with the forfeiture of the bon, on new parties, an that any execution issue on the original jugment afterwars is a nullity, an a sale uner it passes no title. McComb vs. Ellett, 8 S. & M. 505. Robinson vs. Tainter, ib. 613. Chilton vs. Cox, 7 S. & M. 791. The Supreme Court of the Unite States, in Brown vs. Clarke, 4 How. 9, took the same view of the subject.
It is there sai that “the lien of the first jugment ceases, an a new an more comprehensive lien arises upon the statutory jugment, embracing the'property of both principal an sureties in the forthcoming bon, an no action of the court is necessary on the forfeite bon. As soon as the bon is forfeite the ol jugment is extinguishe, an a new lien attaches.”
This new jugment is consiere as possessing the qualities, force, effect an ignity of a jugment obtaine in the orinary moe of proceeing accoring to the course of the common law, an in a court of competent jurisiction; a scire facias may be issue to have execution upon it, (3 How. Miss. R. 1,) an in another State it will be regare as a juicial proceeing within the meaning of the act of'Congress of 1790. As a juicial proceeing it may challenge full faith an creit, an can no more be impeache collaterally than any other jugment. This precise question came uner review in the court of appeals of Kentucky, in the case of Kelly vs. Lank, 7 B. Monroe 223, an was fully iscusse an ably consiere. It was an action of ebt brought on one of these statutory jugments from the State of Mississippi, an the court hel that while the statutory jugment remaine in force, unreverse or annulle, it was recor evience of right in the plaintiffs, an coul only be impeache by evience of as high a grae as itself; an further, that nul ticl recor was the only proper or amissible efence to it in their courts. In Kentucky, a elivery bon is for the whole ebt, an on forfeiture has the force an effect of a jugment on which execution issues as of course. 1 Morehea & Brown's Laws Ky. 641. Joyce vs. Farquar, 1 A. K. Marsh. 20, 21. Chitty vs. Gleim., 3 Mon. 425. An so, as in Virginia, a replevy bon is hel to be an extinguishment of the previous jugment, an of all liens create by execution, because the bon when mae has the force an effect of a jugment, an execution issues against all the obligors for the whole ebt.
The present law came before, this court in Rearon ex part, 4 Eng. 450, an was pronounce constitutional. Subsequently’, in the case of Ruell vs. Magruer, 6 Eng. 579, that case was confirme, an it was hel that the non-elivery of the property transforme the bon, by operation of law, into a statutory j ugment, on which execution might issue against all the obligors, for the ebt, interest an cost remaining unpai; that the forfeiture imparte to the bon the force an effect of a jugment, an that the sheriff’s return of forfeiture was conclusive evience of the fact, an coul not be controverte by parol proof. Substantially, the octrine of the cases in Mississippi is aopte by this, an unoubtely where the law is the same, the ecisions of the courts shoul correspon, as far as justice, comity an reason will permit. An we think it woul be impossible to establish any other octrine, without leaving the ebtor expose to greivous evils, without seriously impairing the harmony of the law, an without eparting from the manifest intention of the legislature.
It will strike every one that it is not the fact of giving a elivery bon an its forfeiture, that works the extinguishment of the previous jugment. It is the fact that the forfeiture, by .express statutory enactment, ipso facto, has the force an effect .of a jugment, becomes a lien by necessary implication against new parties from the ate of the forfeiture, an execution issues on this new statutory jugment against all the obligors; or .as was the case with the bon in question, where the forfeiture ha no such effect, it was only when jugment was actually renere by a court of competent jurisiction, that the original jugment became extinguishe, its lien estroye an the execution ene. The mere giving an forfeiture of the bon coul not affect the jugment, if the creitor chose to still procee on it, an not procee to jugment on the bon. As state, the plaintiff was not boun to resort to the bon an thus surrener any security which the original jugment affore, unless he felt ispose to o so. But if he electe to pursue that remey to obtain the payment of his eman, he coul not capriciously abanon it. 7 Eng. 547. In Campbell vs. Spence, 4 Ala. 543, it was hel that a forfeite elivery bon was no satisfaction, an i not impair the lien of the jugment. An in Leach vs. Will iams, 8 Alab. 765, which was a case of conflicting liens, it was hel that when goos seize were elivere to the efenant on his giving a forthcoming bon, which was forfeite, so that they coul not be sol, the plaintiff might have a new execution, because it i not amount to' satisfaction in law. 4 Ala. 427. 5 Ala. 55. 13 Ala. 304. These cases are presume to have been ecie on a statute similar to our previous law.
We think it has been settle in this court, that a forfeite elivery bon, not having the force an effect of a jugment an not proceee on to jugment, is no extinguishment or satisfaction of a jugment, either temporary or absolute, nor oes it have the effect of breaking or interrupting the jugment lien as between jugment creitors. Thus in Caule vs. Dare, 2 Eng. 46, after a elivery bon forfeite, which i not have the force an effect of a jugment, the plaintiff was allowe to procee on the original jugment, an isregar the bon, the court remarking that “personal property levie on by virtue of the original execution, being returne to the efenant, i not satisfy the execution,” citing Walker vs. Braley, 2 Ark. 278, where it was ecie that levying an execution on the property of a jugment ebtor is no satisfaction where the property oes not remain in possession of the sheriff, but is re-elivere to the efenant on his giving a elivery bon.
In Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe, 7 Eng. 548, it was hel that where a levy was mae an a elivery bon taken an forfeite, an which by statute ha the force of a jugment the levy was ischarge, an the jugment on which the execution issue, satisfie. An various cases were cite which clearly sustaine that position. In Kelly vs. Garvin, 7 Eng. 613, it was hel that a forfeite elivery bon uner the present law amounte to the extinguishment of the original jugment, an the creation of a new one by force of the statute.
An it is proper to observe, that as a forfeite forthcoming bon, whilst in force uner the existing law, is a satisfaction of the first jugment, a faulty or irregular bon may be quashe on motion, at the return term of the execution, an thus remove the. impeiment to proceeing on the jugment. Downman vs. Downman, 2 Wash. 191. The rights an remeies of parties to the bon, an the time an manner of their assertion may be collecte from the cases of Rearon ex parte, 4 Eng. 450; Ruell vs. Magruer, 6 Eng. 578; an that of Kelly vs. Lank, 7 B. Mon. 224, an the authorities therein cite.
On a parity of reasoning a bon, which on forfeiture ha not the force an effect of a jugment, coul not possibly extinguish or impair the original jugment, interrupt its lien, or arrest proceeings on it; because to so hol woul be to eclare that inferior coul estroy evience of ebt of the highest grae an ignity, an that a mere cause of action coul extinguish the solemn jugment of a court of recor. Such a octrine woul contravene every principle of law lai own in the books. Inee the technical satisfaction springing up uner the present law almost reaches the verge of constitutioual authority, an coul not go much farther an be uphel an maintaine.
The previous statute itself shows clearly that the mere taking an forfeiture of a bon, without proceeing to jugment on it, ha no effect on the original jugment; because, upon the conition being broken, the officer coul seize the same, “or any other property of the efenant,” an sell the same to satisfy the execution, thus in the amplest manner recognizing the jugment an execution as in full force an unsatisfie, Rev. Stat. 380. The plaintiff was not confine to the specific property levie on, an which ha been release from legal custoy on giving the bon. The officer was not oblige to seize it again on execution, but ha the right to resort to any other property of the efenant, real, pei’sonal, or mixe, subject to execution, an sell the same on five ays notice, except lan an slaves, which coul only be sol on the usual notice; Cummins vs. Webb, 4 Ark. 233. This most clearly emonstrate that on that statute, as well as on general principles, after giving a elivery bon there never was the slightest reason for saying that the levy remaine unispose of, or that the property still remaine in legal custoy, subject to the execution, or that the plaintiff was preclue from resorting to other property until the levy was exhauste, or that it amounte to a satisfaction, or ha the slightest influence on the original jugment, when the plaintiff electe to procee on such jugment. Certainly it cannot be oubte that the restoration of property to'the efenant on giving a bon for its elivery, was such a legal an effectual isposition of the property as to remove or ischarge the levy. 2 Dallas 68, Taylor vs. Royal Saxon. Wallace 326, Walker vs. McDowell. 4 Smees & Marshall, 118. After that the officer was not responsible for the safe keeping of the property, or for its value, nor i the efenant hol it uner, or for him, or for the plaintiff. It was no longer in legal custoy, for if so no further levy coul be mae until that was ispose of. We have seen that a further levy might be mae, an that other property might be seize on the same jugment an execution.
The officer ha no special property, an coul not maintain trespass or trover for injuring or converting the property, as he-coul o if it still remaine in legal custoy. Although the officer, before the ay appointe for its elivery, might see the property wasting or about to be alienate, yet he woul have no right to become the curator of it, or interfere in any way, as he might an as it woul be his uty to o if it was still in custoia legis.
In fact, all that the officer ha to o to avoi responsibility, was to see that the security on the $bn was sufficient, as the law mae him answerable for that. But the property remaine in the possession an uner the absolute control of the efenant, an belonge to him for all practical purposes, an whether it was or was not charge with a lien coul make no ifference. The efenant might or might not eliver it at his election, because he might prefer to submit to the penalty for a failure; the law on a fair construction giving him that right.
The officer coul take no measure to force the ebtor to have the goos forthcoming at the ay of sale; an if the officer was boun to receive a sufficient elivery bon when tenere, an part, with the possession of the goos, was in no manner liable for them, coul take no measure to compel their elivery, an coul bring no action concerning them; it follows inevitably, in the language of Lor Holt, that there was “no person who coul make title to the goos by virtue of the execution,” an that the ebtor was therefore restore to his rights over them, 6 Mo. 292; 3 Munf. 433. The iea of legal custoy of them was utterly exclue, for, as has been shown, by the giving of the bon, the levy in contemplation of law was legally ispose of, an to still consier the goos as hel uner an by virtue of the execution woul be an absurity in itself. Malone vs. Abbott, 3 Humphries 532.
If there ha been no authority on this point at all, the previous statute woul settle the question; because if a forfeite elivery bon, not having the effect of a jugment an without jugment being sought or pronounce on it, coul amount to the extinguishment of the original jugment an satisfaction of the execution, no further levy coul possibly be mae, an the plaintiffs, nolens volens, woul be oblige to resort to the bon. But that law recognize both jugment an execution to be still effectual for all purposes. We have not lost sight of the fact that the 39th section of the execution law, authorizing the officer, when the conition of the bon was broken, to seize the same or any other property of the efenant subject to the execution, an sell the same on short notice to satisfy the execution, was repeale on the 3 December, 1840, Rev. Stat. 380; Acts 1840, p. 5. It was revive on the 6th of December, 1846. Acts 1846, p. 35. We have referre to, an argue from it merely to illustrate a general principle, an to evince the intention of the law maker at the time of the enactment of the system, as to the effect of a forfeite elivery bon pursue to jugment, an not pursue to jugment, an to emonstrate that such intention was in perfect harmony with general principles of law on the subject. Our reasoning an ecision however, rest on the latter an not on any statutory provision.
The original jugment mentione in the bill, was renere on the 8th of October, 1851;y?. fa. issue thereon the 27th of November, 1841; elivery bons execute on the 4th of March, 1842, an forfeite the 4th of April, 1842, an jugment was renere on the elivery bon, on motion, at the April term, 1842. All these proceeings were ha when the above section was not in force; an as the counsel for the appellants amit, that if there was no statute proviing that the lien shoul remain, an the sheriff seize an sell without process, the lien of the levy an the sheriff’s title are absolutely ischarge by giving a elivery bon: we might say shortly that there being no such statute, when the proceeings were ha, it woul follow on their own reasoning, that there was no lien on the slaves levie on, to be asserte or pursue, an that the court very properly refuse to recognize or enforce it, especially after such a lapse of time, an against bona fie purchasers at a public sale, who have ever been, an ought to be favorites of a court of equity, an whose titles or possessions are not to be isturbe except upon the strongest an most conclusive grouns, an certainly not on astute constructions, oubtful implications, or stale claims. There can be no question but that it is soun policy, as well as the uty of courts to strongly incline to uphol sales, mae uner the authority of law, an protect the title of puz’chasers, because pruent men az’e not ispose to risk their money in so precarious an izivestment as the purchase of law suits; an if szich a policy i not prevail the sacrifice of property at juicial sales woul be as ruinous as it woul be inevitable. But that proposition amits of a more conclusive answer, which is, fiz-st, that after the elivery bon the shez’iff has no title to the goos of any sort, an the levy is release; an secon, treating that section as not repeale, the effect woul be the same,because in the constz’uction of statutes, every part must stan it possible an that coul only be effecte, in cases circumstance as this is, by holing that their lien coul subsist no longer than the jugment remaine in foz’ce, an that if the plaintiff shoul abanon the original jugment an obtain a new jugment on the bon in cases where the property levie on was of equal value with the ebt, he must abie by all the consequences flowing fz’om that step; which have been eclare to be, that the original jugment was thereby extinguishe, its lien merge in the new jugment, an such lien as arose from the levy release an forever ischarge, an the execution en-' e. This, we think, was the true intention of the Legislature. This woul operate as a postponement of the collection of the ebt, an to that extent affor relief to the ebtor, an for which the creitor is suppose to have obtaine aitional security on the responsibility of the officer as to taking a sufficient bon.
Although not compelle, yet if the plaintiff electe to procee to jugment on the bon, then it was like an orinary case of waiving a lien create for his benefit, which waiver may be either express or implie. The statute fails to efine exactly how long the lien of a levy, so calle, shall last, or when it shall en, but that an the subsequent section authorizing the seizure of that or any other property of the efenant to satisfy the execution, when the conition of the bon was broken, an selling personal property on short notice, inicate clearly enough, when taken together, that the lien coul not subsist, when the ol was merge in the new jugment, since the accessary must follow' the principal. Harrison vs. Wilson, 2 A. K. Marsh. 551. An the reason of the rule is that the law', conemning a multiplicity of suits, which too often unnecessarily harrasss a efenant, will not as it has been sai, suffer two subsisting jugments on the same cause of action against the same iniviual. Nor oes this at all conflict with the rule, that a party, having several subsisting remeies, may pursue any one or all of them until he obtains actual satisfaction, (Taylor vs. Thomson, 5 Peters, 369); for that rule is not to be shaken or weakene.
Cases might an oubtless i occur uner the previous law, where the property seize was less in value than the ebt, an consequently the plaintiff ha no choice an was oblige, by motives of self interest an necessity, to procee on the original jugment, regarless of the elivery bon, thus showing that it coul not have been intene, as it coul not be in fact, a satisfaction, or tie up the hans of the plaintiff from proceeing on the jugment. This can never occur uner the existing law, because the bon covers the whole ebt, irrespective of the value of the property. The expression in the statute, that the “levy shall remain a lien upon the property,” means no more than that there is a lien upon it, not substantially ifferent from that general one which an execution creates upon being place in the hans of the officer. It oes not mean that the property is in legal custoy, or oes not belong to the efenant in the same manner as his other personal property, an the authority to seize it, “into whose possession soever the same may have passe,” was intene to guar against frauulent alienations; but not to inhibit bona fie sales before execution execute. The provision, that “no execution shall be a lien,” but from the time such writ •shall be elivere to the officer,” (Digest, 498), has been repeately hel not to alter the property of the goos until the execution is execute, (12 Johns. 406; 4 East, 536), an so, on a parity •of reasoning, the provision above allue to woul have no greater effect. An this exposition we conceive to be in exact accorance with the policy of the law, which oes not encourage liens •on personal property when the possession is parte with, be-, •cause such liens are of a secret nature, an ten to embarrass an obstruct the free alienation of property, so necessary in the trae an commerce of men. They open the oor to the perpetration of fraus on innocent persons, an owing to the mobility of personalty, nothing can be more uncertain than such liens an in no case shoul they be extene or enlarge by juicial construction, 26 Wen. 483. In point of ignity an certainty they are not like liens on real estate create by jugments, or evience by recore mortgages, for these are public an notorious, an preserve in the recors of the country, to which all have access, an of which all are boun to take notice, in all cases where the law makes such 'recors operate in that way.
The Legislature might have consiere that the seizure of property to answer the ebt, the release of the levy on giving a elivery bon, (8 Yerger, 161), an the passing of the goos out of the possession an custoy of the officer into the hans of the efenant again, might, in the absence of any enactment, be construe into the loss of all lien whatever; on a principle soun in law, that as a general rule, possession of personal property is essential to the creation as well as to the continuance of a lien on it. 2 Kent, 639. When a party voluntarily parts with the possession of the property, upon which a lien has attache, such lien is iveste, because it has been well sai, that if it was to follow the goos after they ha been sol or elivere, the incumbrance woul become excessively inconvenient to the freeom of trae, an the safety of purchasers. 1 Stra. 536; 1 East. 14; 2 East. 235; 7 East. 7; 26 Wen. 467; 7 Eng. 572. It has been sai by this court that the lien is only co-existent with the possession of the article, an being once surrenere, cannot be revive by any subsequently acquire possession. 2 Eng. 256. It is true that this octrine, arising from a ifferent lien, coul not apply in terms, but only by analogy to the lien of an execution, an to what we consier as the same in effect — the lien of a levy, since the latter too originates uner the execution an stans on the same footing. The Legislature therefore might not have thought it labor thrown away to exclue the conclusion that might otherwise have been rawn from the restoration of possession to the efenant.
But however full an inflexible an public the lien might be, still it coul not ischarge nor affect a jugment, nor amount to satisfaction, because it is inisputable, on both authority an principle, that a lien is neither a right in or to the thing, but is simply a right on the part of the creitor to have the property, charge with the lien, appropriate for the purposes of satisfaction, if he shall feel ispose to o so. 1 Peters. 443; 1 Mason, 221; 2 Peere Wms., 491. The fact, that the lien exists, oes not place the property in legal custoy, nor appropriate it to the payment of the ebt.
The two negroes, originally levie on an release upon giving the elivery bon, were sol uner an orer of court, at public sale, by the aministrator, as the property of Norbone T. Nelson, ecease, on the first of January, 1846, an purchase by Draper an Williams, two of the appellees.
From the views above expresse it is manifest, that the Real Estate Bank, ha no lien on, or claim to them, an the ecree of the court ismissing the bill as to them was correct.
Thomas M. R. Bankhea, as aministrator of Norbone T. Nelson, answere the bill an insiste that the claim set up by the complainants ha not been presente an authenticate accoring to law against the estate of his intestate within two years from the ate of letters of aministration, an that the same was barre. The court being of that opinion, ismisse the bill as to» him. This ecree we think was right. It falls within the principle ecie by this court in Walker vs. Byers, 14 Ark., where it was hel that, with the exceptions therein specifie, all claims an emans against the estates of ecease persons, whether legal or equitable, must be exhibite properly authenticate, within the perio of two years, or be forever barre. This claim is not within any of the exceptions an therefore that case is a ecisive authority on the question that the appellants can have no relief against the estate of Norbone T. Nelson, or his heirs, oristributees.
Whatever errors exist in the ecree as - to Joanna T. Carrington, aministratrix of Robert Carrington, ecease, Charles T. Nelson, an Ambrose K. Ellett, cannot be notice as these parties have not appeale, an certainly there is nothing,of which», the appellants have a right to complain.
Let the ecree be affirme.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
This writ of error was sue out by the plaintiffs in error, to a jugment obtaine against them in the Clark Circuit Court, after execution ha been issue an levie upon their property, an they, together with others, as securities, execute a forthcoming bon, an the same ha been forfeite, an so returne by the sheriff, an the return term ha elapse, as appears by the ates set out. These facts were set up by plea, to which a emurrer was interpose, an the question is thus presente, whether the plaintiffs in error can now maintain their writ of error to the original jugment.
The constitutionality of the forthcoming law act was consiere an etermine in the case of Rearon, Ex parte, 4 Eng. R. 450. Its unconstitutionality was again urge in the case of Ruell vs. McGruer, (6 Eng. R. 584), an the point again rule as in the former case, with the aitional intimation that, after the lapse of the term, to which the forthcoming bon was returnable, the obligors of the bon coul fin relief only in a court of equity. Afterwars, in the case of Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe, et al. 7 Eng. R. 548, it was hel, that after the forfeiture of the bon the levy was ischarge an the former jugment was satisfie. An to the same effect are the cases of Wright vs. Yell, et al. 13 Ark. 505, an Jamison vs. May, i. 608. An in the case of The Trustees of the Real Estate Bank vs. Sanefur, a. et al. ecie uring the present term, where many of the cases ecie in Kentucky, Vix*ginia, Mississippi an the Feeral Court, as well as our own, are reviewe, it is shown that the statutory jugment is consiere as having the qualities, force, effect an ignity of a jugment, obtaine in the orinaiy moe of proceeing accoring to the course of the common law, in a court of competent jurisiction, an as such may be revive by scire facias, an, in another State, is within the act of Congress of 1790, an can no more be impeache collaterally than any other jugment, (Kelly vs. Lambs, 7 B. Monroe, p. 223.) An these cases sustain the ecision of this court in the case of Kelly et al. vs. Garvin, Carson & Co., (7 Eng. R. at p. 621), where it is hel that “the statutory jugment is an extinguishment of the first jugment upon the principle that a party cannot have more than one jugment for the same subject matter at the same time.”
These consequences resulting from the voluntary act of the efenant in the execution executing the forthcoming bon uner the provisions of the statute, it is no more unreasonable that he shoul thereby be cut off from any further remey in a court of law, an be riven to a court of equity exclusively for relief, as against any other jugment at law, than making an injunction operate as a release of errors at law.
We think the matters set up in the plea sufficient, an therefore the writ of error must be quashe.

1862632,Dougherty vs. McDonald,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins sai,
The question presente in this case, is the same as that ecie in Hart, et al. vs. Wills, Pease & Co., on a former ay of this term. The efenant in error pl'eas in bar of the writ, that before it was sue out, a writ of fieri facias issue upon the jugment complaine of as being erroneous, an the execution being levie upon certain goos of the efenants, for the prouction of which, at the time an place of sale, they ha entere into a elivery bon with security, an containing the further conition prescribe by the act of Deccember 16th, 1846, that in case the property, specifie in the bon, shoul not be elivere as provie therein, the bon shoul have the force an effect of a jugment, on which an execution might be issue against all the obligors therein; that the property not being elivere nor the execution pai, the sheriff ha uly returne the execution unsatisfie, together with the elivery bon eclare to be forfeite, &c.,'to which plea the plaintiffs in error have emurre.
It might be sufficient to say that the ecision of the court is in accorance with that mae in Hart vs. Wills, Pease & Co., before referre to, overruling the emurrer; but as this is the first opportunity I have ha of expressing any opinion of my own on this subject, it seems to be proper that 1 shoul avail myself of at, though in a very brief manner.
When this question was first raise, I thought there were serious ifficulties attening the etermination of it, either way. When the act of December 1846 was passe, after several years of uncertainty an litigation, the effect of elivery bons an the moe of obtaining jugments upon them, where the creitor chose to pursue that course, ha come to be settle an unerstoo accoring to pre-existing statutes; an though oubtless enacte with the earnest intention of strengthening the obligation of contracts by facilitating the remey for any breach of them, it seeme to me that the various questions, growing out of the proper construction to be given to the amenatory statute, so as to harmonize it with the general law as it stoo before, an some of which never coul have been anticipate by the framers of the amenment, woul unfortunately be prouctive of renewe litigation. But while those ifficulties might have to be anticipate an consiere in construing the new law, they woul affor no color of license for isregaring its plain provisions, if within the pale of legislative power.
I am free to say, the oubt in my min has been whether the statute giving to a forfeite elivery bon the force an effect of a jugment, with all its conclusive an unimpeachable qualities,, was constitutional. Though the ecisions of this court, in Rearon, ex parte, 4 Eng. 450, an Ruell vs. Magruer, 6 ib, 578, sustaining its valiity, were imperative upon me, I might still have thought the law constitutional for the only purpose appearing to-be contemplate by it, that is, the summary issuance of execution; an to this en the elivery bon coul be likene to a general power of attorney, whereby the obligors authorize the sheriff to take an sell any property belonging to them for the purpose of paying a particular ebt. An this woul be leaving-out of view the various further questions, that might have to be etermine, some of them being whether the statutory jugment on the elivery bon became a lien on the property of the principal an securities, an therefore constructive notice to subsequent incumbrancers an purchasers, thus laying the founation, for a train of ajuications growing up into a law of property; whether it woul be respecte uner the authentication act of' Congress, when sought to be mae the founation of an action, in another State: whether a writ of error woul lie to it, as to the final jugment of a court; whether the same presumptions are to be inulge in its favor, as woul be accore to the jugment of a court of general jurisiction; an lastly this question, whether it was such a merger or extinguishment, that no writ of error coul afterwars lie to the jugment upon which the execution issue.
Accoring to the former elivery bon law, where there was a forfeiture by the non-elivery of the property, the plaintiff, not. choosing to sue out alias execution, might either bring an orinary action at law upon the bon, or he might obtain a jugment at any time uring the return term against the obligors, on summary motion an without notice or process. The power to rener a jugment without notice, was for a long time oubte, as being contrary to natural justice. But then the only question was, whether the obligors in the bon might not contract for notice, either as a waiver or an acceptance of it in avance of the suit. Yet whether upon actual or constructive notice, there was, in such cases, the intervention of juicial power; the formality at least of a juicial consieration an sentence.
Amitting that a party may well contract for notice of a jugment to be renere against him by a court of competent jurisiction, the ifficulty here woul still be, whether he can contract that his contract shall be a jugment. Because if this be law, the same principle might come to be greatly extene in its application to a variety of cases, whereby jugments woul spring into being without the intervention of juicial power. The policy or propriety of constitutional legislation is no official concern of a juge; but regaring the juiciary as an inepenent an coorinate epartment of the government, it becomes his uty to maintain its authority an assert its jurisiction, for wise purposes conferre by the organic law an for the time being entruste to his keeping. I can unerstan that, as the conclusive effect of a jugment operates by way of estoppel, the General Assembly might, by legislation, attach the same consequences to a contract voluntarily entere into by the parties to it, though it coul harly be sai to be of the same grae of ignity an solemnity; the ifference being that in the one case the party is estoppe by his own voluntary act, while the suitor at law has the right, with the ai of a court, to conclue his aversary by its jugment, against his will. Yet the receive iea, the recognize efinition of a jugment has always been that it is the exercise of juicial power. So that, to constitute a jugment, there must not only be a subject matter, about which an ajuication is sought, a plaintiff an efenant, whose rights are to be affecte by it, but a juge also, or court through whom the law speaks, an who is authorize to eclare its sentence. It was owing to this view that the case of Pickett & Gregg vs. Thruston, 2 Eng. 397, the authority of which is now fully establishe, may not have been regare as a safe preceent.
Sincerely esiring to uphol the statute giving to forfeite elivery bons the force an effect of jugments, I am enable to yiel to the authoritative opinions of my brother juges; but in oing so, feel it incumbent on me to characterize the statute referre to as a angerous innovation in the law, an one which in principle cannot, consistently with the constitution, be any further extene. Consent being amitte as the sole founation for these statutory jugments, I concur in the views expresse in The Trustees R. E. Bank vs. Sanefur, uring the present term, which treats them as jugments for all purposes. Otherwise the most injurious consequences woul follow; inee, there ought to be no mile groun, if it coul be avoie by any reasonable interpretation. An though this be one, many perplexing controversies may be expecte to grow out of the statute.

elivere the opinion of the Court.
'* Elijah D. Robins, in his life time, obtaine a jugment before a-justice of the peace against William Marlow, an for the purpose of’ having execution against the real estate of the efenant, as provie for by the statute, Dig. ch. 95, file a transcipt of such jugment in the Circuit Court clerk’s office; but before satifaction thereof was ha, the plaintiff ie, an his executor, John Robins,' sue out scire facias to revive the jugment in his name as such: executor! At the return term the efenant file his plea to the jurisiction of the Circuit Court, which plea, on motion of the plaintiff, was stricken out, an jugment renere in favor of the plaintiff.
If this ha been an original suit upon the contract sue upon, or upon the jugment renere in the justice’s court thereon, there can be no oubt but that the Circuit Court ha no jurisiction to hear an etermine the same, because the amount in controversy is a matter of contract for some $35, a matter exclusively within the jurisiction of a justice of the peace. But this was a proceeing uner the statute to reach the real estate of the ebtor to satify a jugment renere before a competent tribunal. The transcript, when file, ha uner the statute the force an effect of a jugment renere in the Circuit Court, as well to-bin the real estate by lien, as for process an sale uner it, with-no reference, however, to any ajuication upon the cause of action, because that ha alreay been ajuicate, but solely by the ai of the process of the Circuit Court to have satisfaction of the jugment,-
Such being the object of the statute, such transcript when file has the force an effect of a jugment in that court for that purpose. The object woul, in cases like the present, fail unless the court has the power to keep its process alive by reviving the jugment, so as to enable the plaintiff to sue out process. It is true that, in a limite sense, a proceeing by sci. fa, is a suit upon which an issue may be forme, but that issue is substantially an -enquiry into the right of the plaintiff to have execution of the jugment, an is not an infringement upon the constitutional jurisiction of the justices of the peace.
The plea of the efenant was therefore insufficient, an upon emurrer shoul have been so ajuge; but as a matter of practice, as settle by this court in the case of Sanger vs. State Bank, at the present term, the objection coul not be reache by a motion to strike the plea from the files!
For this error the jugment of the Circuit Court must be reverse an the case remane for further proceeings to be ha «ot inconsistent with this opinion.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
Waiving any objection to the manner in which the questions of law, suppose to be involve in this case, were sought to be-reserve in the court below, we may assume, for the consieration of them here, that the facts (an which might reaily have-been put into the shape of an agree case, or a special verict by the court below sitting as a jury), are as follows. In 1808 Asa Grant ie in North Carolina, leaving a will, one clause of which is in these wors, “ I further give unto my belove wife, (Jemmima), one negro woman, known by the name of Harriett,- an her issue, uring her natural life, an after her eath the sai negro woman Harriet an her issue, I give an bequeath-unto my belove aughters, Clarissa Grant an Polly Grant, to be equally ivie amongst them.” Jemmima Grant, the wiow,. marrie Arthur Morrow;, an they move to Tennessee, an from thence to Arks ansas, where she ie in the year 1848. Clarissa Grant marrie Eli Cox, in Tennessee, where they continue to live! Polly Grant marrie Hiram Williams an they move to Texas, where she ie in the year 1845, leaving several chilren, the issue of their marriage, who are still living. In 1849 Williams sol an conveye all his right, title an interest in the slaves in controversy to Pack an Cates, two 'of the appellants. From the time of his marriage with Jemmima Grant, Morrow always ha possession of Harriet an her; issue, in right of his wife, an after her eath, in 1848, he continue to keep them in possession, never until then claiming them as his own. The negroes now in controversy pre Delia, who is the aughter of Harriet, an George the chil of Delia.
Upon the refusal of Morrow to surrener them, when emane by the appellants, they sue him by action of replevin in the etinet. The efenant pleae non-etinet, an a special plea asserting property in himself, with a traverse of property in the plaintiffs. The court sitting as a jury foun upon the evience, for the efenant, an he ha jugment accoringly.
1. The action of replevin in the etinet, as now regulate by statute, is very similar to etinue, an may be sai to lie in all cases where the plaintiff has the right of property, either general or special, an the right to immeiate possession of a chattel taken or etaine by the efenant, an iffers from etinue in this; that in replevin the plaintiff obtains possession of the chattel in avance of the trial, an the efenant is suppose to be protecte from the harshness of the remey by the affiavit an bon of the plaintiff, an the short perio of limitation prescribe for it! The plea of non-etinet (Digest, Title, Replevin, sec. 34), puts in issue, not only the wrongful etention of the chattel, but the property of the plaintiff therein, an the special traverse pleae here ha no other effect than to tener a istinct an formal issue of the plaintiffs’ property, general or special, an right to possession at the time of suit brought. The action may be maintaine, not only for the breach of a contract of bailment, but the allegation of bailment is fictitious an not traversable; so that replevin in the etinet extens to all cases where the property of one man is wrongfully in the possession of another, though that possession may have been, in its inception, both peaceable an lawful; as in the case of a bailment eterminable by eman. It results from the nature of the action, which is to recover possession of a specific chattel, that if there be several part owners of it, they ought all to be joine as plaintiffs in the suit, an the non-joiner or misjoiner of parties in interest, who ought to be plaintiffs, is available in bar as well as in abatement. Although classe among actions ex elicto, an in theory the remey for a tortious taking, replevin in the etinet iffers essentially from actions ex elicto, where, for the injury, loss or estruction of personal property, owne by two or more persons in common, each part owner might consistently recover several amages, which woul be commensurate with his interest in the chattel, though the chattel itself be not susceptible of ivision. We think, therefore, the plaintiffs were require, uner the pleaings in this case, to show that, as against the efenant, they were the persons an the only persons having such right of property, as woul entitle them to present possession of the slaves in controversy.
2. There is no where upon the recor any allegation or proof of what was the law in North Carolina, the omicil of the testator when his will took effect in the year 1808, or of Tennessee, where Williams an Polly Grant were marrie, or of the law of Texas, where Polly Williams resie at the time of her eath, in 1845; all of which were legitimate subjects of proof, an might perhaps have been important in etermining the rights of the parties; in the first instance, as to the character of the limitation, by way of executory evise, in the will of Asa Grant; in the secon, for ascertaining what right Williams acquire, by his marriage, to the property in possession or expectancy of his wife; an lastly, whether by the law of Texas he succeee at her eath, as heir or istributee, to her property or right of property in the slaves.
It must be assume, as a settle proposition, that the courts of one State or sovereignty cannot juicially take notice of the laws of another an foreign State. They will by comity respect the foreign law, by protecting rights acquire uner it, an will interpret an fulfill the obligation of contracts mae in a foreign State, or with reference to its laws, but those laws are to be prove as facts upon which the claim or efence is base, though this rule of comity is subject to exceptions, where the right claime uner the foreign law is contrary to goo morals, public policy or positive legislation in the country where it is sought to be enforce. The origin an peculiar relations of the American States involve the consieration of this subject, so liable to expan itself, in many perplexities. In Connecticut it seems, Hale vs. The New Jersey Steam Navigation Co., 15 Conn. 539, that by statute, comity is carrie to the extent of requiring her courts to notice juicially the statutes an the reports of ecisions by the courts of other States of the Union; thus imposing upon them, as may reaily be imagine, a most elicate as well as ifficult uty. Notwithstaning the law of this State only relaxes the rule of evience by proviing, that the printe statute books of other States, purporting to be publishe by authority, shall be receive as evience of their contents, several cases are to be foun in the reporte ecisions of this court, not the least Remarkable among which is Mooy vs. Walker, 3 Ark. 147, where counsel argue an the court referre, for the rule of ecision, to what was unerstoo to be the common or statute law of other States, without any amission or proof of it appearing to have been mae in the inferior court.
The courts of every State are boun to take juicial notice of the public laws an treaties of the Unite States; because, to the extent of the powers elegate to the feeral government, an the subjects about which Congress may rightfully legislate, they form one country: while on the other han, the life of the feeral juiciary an its stronghol on the affections of the people epen upon respecting the reserve sovereignty of the States, an the ue aministration of their respective systems of law or local usage, uner which private rights have veste. An unless with the anomalous exception of the civil law proceure in Louisiana, goo policy has always ictate a conformity with the remeies furnishe by the State laws. So that, in a case like the present, a court of the Unite States, otherwise acquiring jurisiction by citizenship of the parties an value in ispute, woul be enable to know juicially the law of any State, an all moifications of it affecting the title to the slaves in controversy upon the facts here proven. An where two countries have the same origin, or were at one time associate, the courts of each are boun to take juicial notice of what the law was, when it was common to both. Thus, before their separation, the laws of Missouri extene over what is now Arkansas; an the courts of the new States, forme out of territory which belonge originally to one of the thirteen colonies, might have to look to the jurispruence of the parent State, while its laws were in force over the entire territory. No such relation has ever existe between Arkansas an Carolina, Tennessee, or Texas.
Our English ancestors, who colonize America, brought with them certain funamental principles of the common law, such as the right of trial by jury, an the privilege of habeas corpus, which were essential to the enjoyment of civil liberty in Englan, as they are here. But it cannot be sai that the great boy of the common law, or the English Statutes, passe in ai of it, prevaile in the colonies, 1 Black. Com. 107, an it cannot be presume that it prevails now entire in any of the States of this Union. Even if the perios of its aoption coul be ascertaine, an a istinction taken between the common an statute law of Englan, we must know, as matter of legal history, that in every American State many of its leaing features have been abrogate or change by legislation, or essentially moifie by local common law or usage. Of so much of the common law, as has been expressly aopte, or is tacitly recognize, the reporte ecisions of the courts in Englan ought to be regare as its expositors. But even such aoption is partial, an isjointe: nor .are the ecisions of the courts of this country, feeral as well as State, in harmony with one another, or with those of the courts in Englan, upon a variety of purely common law questions. Even in cases involving commercial law, where#uniformity is so much to be esire, the ecisions of each State, liable to be influence by local consierations, not appreciable in another, cannot there be always safely followe as preceents. We nee not look beyon the case uner consieration for examples of such iversity of law. It is to be inferre from a provision containe in the Revise Statutes of North Carolina, vol. 1, ch. 37, sec. 22, passe in the year 1823, an the ecisions in that State, cite in Inge vs. Murphy, 10 Ala. 885, that previous to the statutes referre to, a limitation of a remainer in a chattel after a life estate, like that containe in the'will of Asa Grant, woul be effectual in North Carolina, by way of executory evise, but such limitation, if mae by ee, woul not have been vali, an the first taker woul have the absolute estate.
In Newton, ex’r vs. Cocke, ex'r. 5 Eng. 169, where suit was brought here by one claiming to be a foreign executor, by virtue of the statute authorizing foreign executors an aministrators, appointe in other States or territories of the Unite States, uner the laws thereof, to sue in any of the courts of this State in their representative capacity with like effect as if they ha been qualifie uner the laws of this State, in as much as the exemplification of the recor of the will in Kentucky prouce an oyer, i not affor any evience of the appointment or qualification of the plaintiff, suing as executor, an there being no evience of what the law of Kentucky was, an it coul not be juicially recognize here, .this court felt itself calle upon to presume that the law of Englan, as it stoo at the time of the American revolution, prevaile in Kentucky, an to etermine with apparent reference to it, the sufficiency of the evience auce to prove the appointment an qualification of the plaintiff, as executor. ■ An that course seeme unavoiable because the statute, by referring to the law of the State uner which the executor erive his authority, exclue the iea that his qualification was to be teste by the law of this State. But apart from that or like exceptions., which might be occasione by unguare legislation, the courts of this State have no warrant for knowing juicially, an so aministering the law of any other State or country foreign to this: an outsie of the feeral compact the States of this Union are to be regare as foreign to each other. In 1816 the Territorial Legislature of Missouri, formally aopte an eclare in force the common law of Englan of a general nature an all statutes of the British Parliament in ai of, or to supply the efects of the common law, mae prior to the fourth year of James the first an of a general nature, an not local to that kingom, an which common law an statutes were not contrary to the laws of that territory, an not repugnant to, nor inconsistent with the constitution an laws of the Unite States, as the rule of ecision in that territory, until altere or repeale by the Legislature: an that statutory aoption has ever since continue to be in force uner the territorial an State governments in Arkansas. Having thus intronce the common law, without inee the benefit of any of the juicious statutory reforms in Englan since the fourth year of James the first, when we aminister that law, or what is left of it consistent with our own coifications, we o so, not because it is the law of Englan, but because it is part of our own law. It is therefore the law of the forum, to which they have submitte, that, in the absence of proof or amission of any other, is to etermine the rights of the parties, no matter where the transactions occurre out of which those rights may spring. If the contract, for a breach of which suit is brought here, was mae, or to be performe in another State, the law of that State, unless shown to be ifferent, is presume to be the same as our own. So that if either plaintiff or efenant, asserting or resisting a eman by suit, claime that the law, peculiar to another State an applicable to the case, arising upon the facts proven, is ifferent from that of the forum, he can only obtain the benefit of the foreign law, by making it a part 'of the case in evience,
3. One of the questions mainly argue is, whether Williams succeee as istributee to the choses in action of his ecease wife, or her chattels not reuce into possession uring the coverture; an, supposing that he woul be entitle to them, whether he or any assignee of his coul bring- an action for their recovery, without taking out aministration upon his wife’s estate an suing in a representative capacity. It will be concee, that at the common law, the custom grew up for the husban to be entitle to receive from the orinary the elegate power of aministering upon the wife’s estate, an, becoming possesse of the goos as aministrator, he was allowe to retain any surplus after the payment of the ebts, without being require to make istribution to her next of kin. But neither the statute of 22 Chas. 2, requiring aministrators to make istribution; nor that of 29th of Chas. 2, exempting the husban, aministering in right of his being such, from the uty of making istribution, an thus recognizing his legal right to'retain the surplus, ever ha any force or operation in this State. An for the source of the husban’s right to aminister, it woul harly be necessary to go back to the common law; supersee here by a statutory system of aministration.
. Accoring to the Territorial law, Steel & McCamp, Dig., Title Aministration, sec. 4, the husban or wife ha the preference, before the next of kin, in aministering upon the estate of the other; an that law, ib. Title Descents an Distributions, unertook to efine accurately what interest the husban, surviving •his wife, shoul take in her real estate an slaves an personal estate in possession or in action, varie by the contingencies of her ying with or without issue. The Revise Statutes succeeing the Territorial law, re-enacte so much of it, Title, Aministration, sec. 6, as require letters to be “grante to the representatives of the intestate who may apply for the same an are qualifie, preferring first, the husban, or wife,.or one of the persons entitle by law to a istribution of t]ie intestate’s estate,” an though the language there use, woul seem as if intene to apply to a state of Case, where by law the husban or wife surviving woul succee, as istributee, to the whole, or some part of the estate of the other, yet the statute of Descents an Distributions, as re-moelle by the revisors, negatives any such apparent intention. The first section of that chapter provies, that “when any person shall ie having title to any real estate of inheritance or personal estate, not ispose of nor otherwise limite by marriage settlement, an shall ie intestate as to such estate, it shall escen an be istribute in parceny to his kinre, male an female, subject to the payment of ebts an the wiow’s ower, in the following manner; first to chilren or their escenants in equal parts,” &c. In aition to that section, which woul impose upon every aministrator the uty of making istribution in accorance with it, because no exception is any where mae in favor of the husban, the 7th section exclues all right of his by proviing, that in the event of there being no chilren or their escenants, or any paternal or maternal kinre capable of inheriting, the whole estate shall go to the wife or husban of the intestate, an if there be no husban or wife, then to escheat. Though an examination at large of this subject, an especially as connecte with a more recent enactment of December 8th, 1846, enabling marrie women to become seize or possesse of property, real or personal, in their own right, while the former law, enying to them the general power of testamentary isposition, is retaine in force, woul isclose much of lamentable uncertainty an inconsistency, we have no iscretion to construe away what appears to be the necessary result of the statute, whether so intene or not, 1 Swift Digest 28. Reeves Dom. Rel. 16. Bunch's a. vs. Hurst's am'r 3 Dessau. 289. Gough vs. Crane. 3 Marylan Chy. Rep. 127, an must conclue that as the law now stans, the husban surviviving is entitle only to the preference in the aministration of the estate of the wife, to enable him to recover her choses in action not ispose of or converte by him, an her personal property, not reuce to possession uring coverture, for the purpose of paying her ebts an making istribution of the surplus among her next of kin, to all of whom he is postpone in the succession.
It is not pretene that two of the plaintiffs have sue here in a representative capacity; an assuming the law to be as we have state it, we nee not enquire further whether the husban, entitie as istributee of the wife’s estate, shoul nevertheless sue as her aministrator; though we apprehen, that in such case he woul come uner the general rule, that in an action at law to recover the personal property of an intestate, the plaintiff must erive title by or through an aministrator.
4. Conceing that Morrow, upon the eath of his wife, who ha the use of the negroes uring her life, cease to have any right to etain them from those entitle in remainer, the only remaining groun contene for in argument, upon which the present plaintiffs can expect to recover, is that the interest of Polly Grant in the negroes being a veste one, though in remainer, it became also, upon her marriage with Williams, transferre to an veste in him as absolutely as it was in her. The argument is, that the negroes were not choses in action, but property, the possession of which is always presume to be with the title; that the possession of Morrow, in right of his wife an uring the continuance of her life estate, was not averse but consistent with the title of .those in remainer, an consequently, his possession was their possession, in like manner as if he ha been a mere bailee.
Plausible as that may appear, we apprehen the law to be Well settle, that marriage is a gift to the husban of personal property an choses in action of the wife, subject to the conition of his reucing them to possession uring coverture, an that being accomplishe the gift becomes absolute. By the marriage he becomes liable for her ebts previously contracte, but such liability ceases upon the issolution of the marriage by her eath, if not before that time enforce by suit against him. The creitors of the wife woul then be without remey, unless they can resort to the separate property of the wife, or her chattels, or choses in action, not reuce to possession by the husban uring coverture. Accoring to the law in Englan an many of the Unite States, the husban surviving is entitle to all such property of the wife, which he is entitle to recover as her aministrator, thus afforing a fun for the payment of the ebts of the wife whilst sole, an he retains the resiue absolutely, succeeing to it in the character of husban. The’ husban uring coverture, may sell or transfer by assignment, legal or equitable, for a valuable consieration, his wife’s choses in action, her chattels not reuce to possession, or, in more general terms, all her right to the present or future enjoyment of them; but if he ie without making such isposition, the title to them has not been change an they survive to the wife in preference to the aministrator of the husban. So that the marriage oes not operate transfer to the husban as an absolute gift, all the property to which the wife may be entitle, but only the power, by virtue of her right of property, of recovering or reucing it to his possession uring the coverture; though inee there may be a variety of vexe questions in practice, not affecting the theory, concerning what acts of the husban will constitute a reuction to possession. The later ecisions in Englan not only hol that as against the wife surviving, the husban must have exercise his power of alienation uring the coverture, but they go to the extent of making the valiity of the husban’s alienation contingent upon a reuction to possession by the assignee uring the coverture, not only in respect of sales of reversionary interests of the wife, which might not fall in, but of all choses in action, though at the time of assignment susceptible of being immeiately reuce into possession; proceeing upon the groun that such being the extent of the husban’s power, his sale or assignment passes no greater authority than he himself ha. If that apparent change in the common law is inuce by a esire to enlarge the equitable claim of the wife to a settlement or possession for her support, similar to that policy which has prompte the recent statutes in this country, allowing the wife to take an hol a separate property, it may be efective because its benefits are precarious; but it has the merit of enabling a court to affor, in harmony with the common law, an aequate provision for the wife where she nees it, an without any of the jealousies an heart-burnings attening a separation of interests while the marrie relation subsists. But without reference to what may be terme a new feature in the law, it oes seem that, upon ol an establishe principles applicable to the present case, the husban, Williams, i not acquire any absolute property in the slaves in controversy. The two aughters ha a veste remainer, which gave them a fixe right of future enjoyment, but the beneficial use of the slaves was in the mother uring her life.’ The right of possession was with the temporary use, which Williams coul not lawfully isturb, an as his wife ie before the etermination of the life estate, it was not possible that he, or any assignee of his coul have reuce it to possession uring coverture. At her eath, without any previous isposition of them by him, his power to sell her choses in action, or rights of property in expectancy cease, equally with his own right to recover them! It is true, those entitle in remainer to a specific chattel have an interest in preserving it, an may by injunction prevent its removal, or restrain those having the temporary use, from acts tening to injure or eteriorate it, an not necessary to a reasonable or juicious enjoyment. If estroye they might have a remey in trespass for amages, equivalent to the value of their interest in remainer; but there coul be no remey for those in remainer, inconsistent with the temporary right of possession in the person having the particular estate.
Upon an examination of the cases cite for the appellant in support of the position, that Williams by his marriage acquire an absolute title to his wife’s estate in remainer in the slaves even though she ie before the etermination of the particular estate, an not subject to any contingency of the property being reucible into possession uring the coverture, it will be foun that the octrine ha its origin at a very early ay in Virginia, the first reporte case being that of Dae vs. Alexaner, 1 Wash. 30, an the sole reason given in the report of the case, was the statement of the Presient of the court of appeals; that such ha been the constant ecision of the ol general court from the year 1653, to the revolution, since confirme in the then court of appeals in several cases, an that it ha thus become a fixe an settle rule of property. In Wallace vs. Taliafero, 2 Call., the same court, eviently embarrasse by having to ahere to another an inconsistent rule of the common law, yet respecte the former ecisions an uphel them upon the only intelligible groun, assigne by the Presient of the court, that he “ha consiere the principle as a fixe rule of property tening to quiet isputes.” The same remark is applicable to Robinson’s am’r vs. Brock, 1 Hen. & Munf. 224, an Wae vs. Boxley, 5 Leigh 442. In Dummon vs. Snee, 2 Call. 494, the sale by the husban surviving, of a slave to which his wife ha been entitle in remainer, was sustaine on that groun, an also because he was empowere to sell as aministrator. It was natural that the course of ecisions on this subject in Virginia, the parent State, shoul have been aopte in Kentucky. The first case where it appears to have been followe is Pinkar vs. Smith, Littell Sel. cas. 336; an there the court say, “Except for the purpose of ascertaining the proper parties to the present contest, it is not however material whether the husban was entitle to the remainer in the slaves, merely as surviving husban, or in virtue of his right to aminister on the wife’s estate.” In Bank’s am’r vs. Marksberry, 3 Littell 281, the rule was istinctly asserte, though it may have been influence by a statute of Kentucky there quote, an the court enter into the same argument use here, to establish a ifference between choses in action, which o not vest in the husban unless reuce into possession uring the coverture, an his marital rights in the wife’s expectancies in remainer; an argument which implies that the rule sought to be introuce was an innovation, an not a familiar principle of the common law! It has been since followe in that State, Ewing vs. Hanley, 4 ib. 346. Jackson vs. Sublett, 10 B. Mon. 471, though an attempt to reconcile all the cases, Tilfor vs. Anerson, 7 Dana 108. Turner vs. Davis, 1 B. Mon. 152. Thomas vs. Kenney, 4 ib. 236. Hor vs. Hor, 5 i. 83. Bowling am’r vs Bowling, 6 i. 33. Ring vs. Balrige, 7 ib. 535. Davenport vs. Brewett, 9 ib. 95, bearing upon the rule contene for, woul result in emonstrating it to be an exception, which the courts of that State have been eneavoring to limit in its application to the precise state of ease occurring in Dae vs. Alexaner, where but for the exclusion of the creitors, if any, of the wife um sola, it woul be immaterial whether the husban surviving took as such, or as aministrator of the wife. The case of Magil vs. Tolan, 8 Porter 36, stans upon its special circumstances, as woul appear from the subsequent case of Bibb vs. McKinley, 9 ib. 637, an ecies only that the possession of the guarian is the possession of the war. The case of Pitts vs. Curtis, 4 Ala. 350, (not within reach) has also been cite for the appellants,but as referre to an qualifie in Broome vs. King, 10 ib. 821, it appears to have been base solely upon the authority of Dae vs. Alexaner an Banks vs. Marksberry. An in this connection it is worthy of remark that the octrine of some of the later cases in Englan, Hornsby vs. Lee, 2 Ma. Chy. 16. Paren vs. Jackson, 1 Russ. 1, an Honnor vs. Morton, 3 Russ. 65, before allue to, has been formally recognize by the court of appeals in Virginia, Browning vs. Healey, 2 Robinson 370, though it may be subject to their peculiar istinction between the wife’s remainer in a chattel an her choses in action.
On the whole, we conclue that, whatever may be the result in a suit between other parties, or uner a ifferent state of proof, accoring to the case mae by the recor before us, upon the eath of Polly Williams, her estate in the slaves in controversy evolve upon her next of kin, accoring to the statute of istributions, an woul be recoverable by her aministrator for their benefit, an consequently two of the plaintiffs, claiming as assignees of the husban, have faile to establish any legal title in themselves.

elivere the opinion of the Court*
The peculiar state of case, upon which the question here to be etermine arises, is as follows : Upon the remaning of this cause, after the ecision of it by this court, reporte in 3 Eng. 345, various amene pleas were interpose by the several efenants, to which the plaintiffs replie, an upon which issues of fact were forme, properly triable by a jury. We o not now consier or etermine, whether those issues were material or immaterial, or the legal sufficiency of any of the pleas to bar the action; because that enquiry is not now involve, an the plain-' tiffs having treate the pleas as sufficient, we may inten that they were so, an that they were amene in accorance with the intimations containe in the opinion of this court, before cite. A reference to that opinion an the previous report of the same case, Outlaw vs. The Governor, 5 Ark. 468, will explain the nature of the suit which was against the principal an securities on the official bon of an aministrator, an the various efences interpose. Upon the last trial of the cause a jury was empam nele an sworn to try the issues joine. There were also issues upon pleas of nul liel recor, which, being submitte to the coart, were foun in favor of the efenants: “An thereupon,” as state in the recor, “the plaintiffs excepte to the fining of the court upon sai issues, an immeiately file their bill of exceptions in respect thereof, which is signe, seale an orere to form a part of the recor herein. Whereupon the plaintiff refusing to procee further in the cause, it is orere by the court that the jury empannele in the cause be ischarge.” Then follows the jugment of the court, that the plaintiffs take nothing by their writ, an that the efenants go thence without ay an recover their costs, &c. It appears from the bill of exceptions that the plaintiffs offere in evience certain recors which are set out, to prove the recovery of jugment in the original suit by Conant & Co. against the aministrators, an which was all the evience auce in the cause.
The fining of the court, that there was no such recor, was without oubt, a gross error; the issues an the evience being the same in respect of which this court ecie, when the cause was here before, (3 Eng. 353,) that the court below ha correctly foun in favor of the plaintiffs: nor woul an enquiry be tolerate of an after iscovere variance, if any such be allege. An inasmuch as those issues were triable by the court itself, not sitting as a jury, having a plain uty to fin the evience sufficient, which the previous ecision of this court ha mae a foregone conclusion, there coul be no hesitation in reversing the jugment, if that was the only question; isregaring the point argue for the efenants upon the authority of The State Bank vs. Conway, 13 Ark. 344, where there was an exception to the fining of the court sitting as a jury, certifying the evience without raising any question of law.
But that error of the court i not, in our opinion, warrant the plaintiffs in stopping the cause there, an refusing to procee any farther with it. It is a clear proposition that a plaintiff woul not be entitle to jugment when there is a goo plea in unanswere, Cole vs. Wagnon, 2 Ark. 154. Boyer vs. Robinson, 1 Eng. 552; though a verict an jugment for the plaintiff will not.be reverse for want of a plea, which was the fault of the efenant. Shropshire vs. McLain, ib. 440. The question is, whether a jugment is final, so that a writ of error will lie to it, which isposes of only a part of the issues in the cause. In Wooruff et al. vs. The State, 3 Ark. 286, the efenants below ha pleae several pleas; to one of which a emurrer was interpose on behalf of the State, issues of fact being mae up on the others. The emurrer was sustaine in the court below, an by agreement, the other issues awaite the ecision of the Supreme Court on the emurrer; but the nature of that agreement, an the jugment consequent upon it, not necessarily notice in that ecision, will appear in the subsequent report of the same case, 3 Eng. 333, where the question arose whether the agreement ha not been violate after the remaning of, the cause upon reversal. The agreement was to the effect, that the court below, in case it sustaine the emurrer to one of the pleas, shoul procee by consent of parties to rener final jugment in favor of the State, not only upon the emurrer, but upon the other pleas, to which issues of fact ha been joine. Such jugment was accoringly renere, an unless that habeenone, we apprehen this court woul not have ajuicate the cause without an oversignt. The result was that the efenants below stake every thing on obtaining a reversal of the jugment, which they ha agree shoul be final, if against them upon the emurrer; because if the jugment ha been affirme, the cause coul not have been remane for the trial of the other issues of fact. In the report of the case last cite, the court say, “It is not in the power of a party to single out any one issue, even by the most solemn contract of recor, an submit it to the consieration of the Supreme Court, so as to elicit the opinion of the Supreme Court, upon the law or the fact of that particular issue. Such a jugment woul not be final; as not embracing all the issues in the case; an, consequently, it coul not become the subject of an appeal or writ of error. The real object of the parties was to take the opinion of the Supreme Court upon the question of law arising upon the emurrer to the secon plea; but in orer to receive the benefit of that ecision it became absolutely-necessary that the Circuit Court shoul pass upon all the issues joine.”
The language of the opinion quote is applicable to the present case an ecisive of it, though the position of the parties is inverte. In the case of The State vs. Wooruff et al., the efenants, if they wishe to take the opinion of the Supreme Court upon any one of their efences, were boun either to have withrawn the pleas upon which issues of fact ha been joine, or consente that final jugment might go upon them in favor of the plaintiff, so as to mature the whole case for the ecision of the appellate court, because the recor coul not remain in both courts at the same time for ajuication: otherwise causes woul be etermine by picemeal, an there woul be an en of the • salutary rule of law, the esign of which is to make an en of the litigation, that the jugment conclues the parties as to every matter examinable at law, in support or avoiance of the right asserte, whether urge there or not. In this case, where the jugment of the court below, in favor of the efenants, upon one goo plea, going to the whole cause of action, was sufficient to bar it, an the plaintiff coul not force the efenants, having the right to plea several matters, to withraw their other efences, the only course left for the plaintff was to procee with the trial, an obtain or submit to a verict of a jury upon the issues of fact, which they ha been sworn to try.
The most favorable construction for the plaintiffs, that can be put upon the recor entry, is that, uring the progress of the trial, they electe to take a non-suit, though such may not have been their intention. Since with us courts have no power to orer a peremptory non-suit, it is no answer to say that the plaintiffs were compelle to go out of court by an erroneous ecision upon one of the issues, which, if it ha been correct, woul have barre a recovery an put an en to the case. If the plaintiff goes out of court by his own voluntary act, though uner a misapprehension, no writ of error lies to reverse the jugment consequent upon it. He might move to set asie a non-suit occasione by surprise or alarm at some interlocutory ecision of the court, or if he persiste in going on to verict an jugment, might ask for a new trial upon the groun that the court ha erre: but even in such case he woul have to satisfy the court that but for its erroneous ecision, he was prepare with evience to entitle him to a recovery upon all the issues.
The ecision of the court therefore, is that the writ of error be ismisse. Upon this, see Peet vs. McGrace, 21 Wen. 667. Watson vs. Anerson, Harin Rep. 458. Van Worneer vs. Mayor of Albany, 18 Wen. 173. Vestal vs. Buritt, 6 Black. 556. It is proper to say, that in the ecision at a former ay of the present term, upon emurrer to a plea in bar of this writ of error, because the plaintiffs ha praye an prosecute an appeal without superseeas from the same jugment; that was the only question presente, an the recor itself was not before the court.

A emurrer was interpose, an the causes assigne were : 1st, that the plea was not sworn to; 2, that it conclue to the country, an not with a verification; an 3, that it was frivolous. The emurrer was sustaine an final jugment was renere for the plaintiff below, an the cause brought here by writ of error.
Accoring to the course of ecisions in this court, the emurrer i not reach the first objection. To o this a motion to strike out was necessary. (Wilson & Turner vs. Shannon & wife, 1 Eng. R. 196.

The averment in the eclaration that the writing obligatory in question, was mae payable to the plaintiff, Bener, by the style of D.

An although, in general, it is the property of the plea of the “general issue,” in any form of action, to eny all the facts set forth in the eclaration, an to put the plaintiff on proof of every essential fact allege by him, it was expressly rule, in the last mentione case, that the plea of non est factum woul not traverse an allegation like this in question, an that that plea putting in issue only the sealing an elivery of the writing obligatory, amitte as true all the other material allegations in the eclaration. From this then it follows that the allegations in question coul only have been specially ha verse. This was the object contemplate by the plea in question; the legal sufficiency only of which, an not its form, or want of verification by affiavit, is brought in question by the emurrer.
As a special traverse, esigne for the enial of only one of the several facts allege in the eclaration, although it containe other matter, an was otherwise objectionable upon special emurrer, before that was abolishe, it properly conclue to the country.

elivere the opinion of the Court!
The facts of this case, necessary to a correct unerstaning of it, may be thus state.
On the 29th of May, 1838, Reason an John T. Bowie execute a bon with covenant, to make title to one Blackmore, for certain tracts of lan in Phillips county. The bon was in the penal sum of $2,000, an after reciting, that the Bowies ha that ay sol the lans therein escribe to sai Blackmore, his heirs an assigns, for the consieration of $1,000; that is to say $400 cash in han, an the resiue in two installments of $300 each, one ue on the 1st of January, 1839, an the other on the 1st of January, 1840, it was conitione to be voi if they shoul well an truly make or cause to be mae to Blackmore his heirs or assigns, a goo an sufficient warranty ee, in fee simple, for the lans therein before escribe, so soon as the final payment of sai sums of money shoul be mae, or as soon thereafter as might be reasonably convenient. The bon for title was acknowlege an recore, on the ay of its ate, in the office of the recorer of ees an mortgages for Phillips county. Black-more pai the first note for $300, ue on the 1st of January, 1839, an Reason Bowie, to whom the secon note for like amount was mae payable on the 1st of January, 1840, assigne it to Irvin, to whom Blackmore afterwars mae payment of $150, upon it. The resiue of this note with interest remaining unpai. Ir.vin sue Blackmore, an on the 19th of November, 1841, obtaine jugment against him on the corfimon law sie of the Phillips Circuit Court for the amount ue. Execution was issue upon this jugment on the 27th of March, 1845, uner which the lans in question were avertise an sol on the 21st of April following, an Irvin became the purchaser of them, for the sum of $50. Aners an Horner being creitors of Blackmore, obtaine a jugment against him in the same court, on the 20th of November, 1841, for $1271, upon which an execution was issue, an uner it the same lans were avertise an sol as the property of Blackmore on the 1st of April, 1844, an Aners became the purchaser for the sum of $700, an by virtue of such purchase obtaine possession of the lans.
On the 27th of February, 1846, Irvin exhibite his bill against the two Bowies, Blackmore an Aners, alleging the foregoing facts, an farther representing that Aners ha become,insolvent an non-resient: that the jugment against him in favor of the complainant remaine wholly unsatisfie, unless it be entitle to a creit of $50, the amount of his bi at execution sale for the lans in question; an that the Bowies refuse to make a ee for the lans until Blackmore ha complie by the payment of the purchase money therefor, accoring to the conition of their bon an covenant to him for title.
The bill praye that the complainant’s purchase of the lans uner execution be set asie an hel for nought; that Aners be require to pay to the complainant the full amount of his jugment at law against Blackmore, or in efault thereof, that the lans be mae subject an ecree to be sol by a commissioner of the court for the satisfaction of the same: that the entire interest an claim of all the parties to the suit shoul vest in the purchaser of the lans at such sale, an that the same operate as an acquittance an release to the Bowies, from all obligation uner their bon for title to convey the same. The bill, on the emurrer of Aners, was ajuge insufficient an ismisse for want of equity.
The main question argue in this case, is settle by the ecision of this court in Smith vs. Robinson et al. 13 Ark. 533. When the Bowies sol the lans to Blackmore, an gave him their bon for title on payment of the purchase money, the transaction was, in all essential features, a security for the payment of the purchase money; the same, in effect, as if they ha mae him a ee an taken a mortgage back to attain the same en, which the parties ha in view. In the case referre to, the origin an history of this species of conveyance, peculiar to the new States, is explaine. Uner the lan system aopte by the Unite States, inchoate equitable titles were erive in various ways, from the government through its lan officers. Until the emanation of patents, often suspene or elaye for years, it woul be impossible for the owner of lan so situate, to make title upon a sale of it. Bons or covenants for title were therefore resorte to as a matter of necessity. The policy of the country having always been to facilitate the transfer of real estate, it often happene that the same tract of lan woul be successively sol in the same manner, where none of the venors or purchasers ha the legal title. So the custom grew up of selling lans by means of a bon or covenant of the venor,, conitione to make conveyance of the legal title when procure from the Unite States, an where the sale was upon creit, the further conition was inserte to make title upon the payment of the purchase money. This informal conveyance was something more than an executory agreement to sell; it importe a present sale, which passe the ownership an beneficial interest in the lan, to the purchaser, usually accompanie with possession, or the right of possession as against the venor, being an equivalent for the interest of the purchase money. Such an estate or interest in lan was recognize at an early ay by territorial legislation as a “seizin in equity.” Steele & McCamp. Dig. Title, Aministration, sec. 27; ib. Title, Conveyances, sec. 2; ib. sec. 7. Rev. Stat. Title, Aministration, sec. 161. Ib. Title, Execution, sec. 23. Provision was mae for the recoring of such instruments, whereby they became constructive notice of title; Rev. Stat. Title, Conveyances, sec. 22. The lien reserve by means of them to the venor, has none of the oious characteristics of the venor’s equitable lien for the unpai purchase money, where having conveye the legal title, acknowleging the receipt of the purchase money, he ought not to be hear to assert it against any subsequent purchaser or incumbrancer, without clear an unequivocal proof of actual notice.. On the contrary the venor, in this moe of conveyance, oes not expressly refuse to part with the legal title; an whether by the terms of the contract the payment of the purchase money be a conition preceent, or epenant upon the final execution of the ee, the result is the same. It makes no ifference whether the bon for title be recore or not. If recore, it becomes notice: if not on recor, that circumstance woul, of itself be sufficient to put any subsequent purchaser or incumbrancer upon enquiry; because an examination of the recor woul show title out of the venor. An unlike the equitable lien of the venor, who has parte with the legal title, if notes be taken for the purchase money with any aitional or personal security, the fact of the venor, who gives only a bon or covenant for title, taking such aitional security, is no waiver of the lien, where it is expressly reserve by the terms of the contract, so that the payment of the purchase money, from whatever source it may be erive, is to be a conition preceent, or a simultaneous act with the execution of the ee. Although in Brown vs. Morrison, 5 Ark. 217, this istinction is not clearly state, it necessarily follows, from the ecision there, upholing the lien of Brown, the venor, notwithstaning he ha taken the notes of Cole, with personal security. As the court there sai, “ His covenant only bins him to convey upon the reception of the purchase money.”
But the appellee insists, that whatever lien the original venor may have ha, it is not assignable, an i not pass to Irvin by the assignment of the note to him, but that when Bowie transferre the note for value receive, he got his money, being ail that he was entitle to ask, an that the conition being accomplishe, no further act remaine for him to o, but to execute the conveyance. Again, it woul be sufficient for the ecision of this point to refer to the opinion in Smith vs. Robinson; because whenever we assimilate the sale of lan, by means of a bon or covenant conitione to make title on payment of the purchase money, to a conveyance an mortgage back to secure the same en, the usual incients of a mortgage attach to the transaction, an the rights of the parties, growing out of it, are to be governe by analogous rules. The weight of authority no oubt is, that the equitable lien of the venor is personal to him, an is not, unless uner some peculiar equitable circumstances, assignable. We ecline going into any such question, because it is not presente here, an is only notice by way of contrast with the escription of lien now uner consieration: clearly the lien, uner a bon for title on payment of the purchase money, being expressly reserve by contract, tantamount to a mortgage security for the benefit of the venor, an the note for the purchase money transferrable like any other chose in action mae assignable by law, the assignment of the note tacitly carries with it the venor’s lien by way of mortgage security, an as an incient to the ebt. The value of the note, as a negotiable instrument in the hans of the venor, woul be impaire, if the security coul not accompany a transfer of it to an assignee. The right of the purchaser to a conveyance epens upon the payment of the note by him, or by some one who has become subrogate to his rights, as was the case in Smith vs. Robinson, an not upon the fact that the venor has receive the money upon the note, if it be still outstaning against the purchaser; an this woul be so, though he ha enorse it without recourse, or though he shoul become ischarge by the laches of the holer as at'the law merchant, or by his failure to pursue the maker with ue iligence to insolvency uner the statute of assignments, or supposing the assignor’s liability upon the ""contract of assignment to become barre by limitation. That the venor’s lien, when thus reserve by the terms of the contract, is assignable in those States, where this moe of conveyance by bon for title prevails, see Tanner vs. Hicks, 4 Smees & Marsh. 294. Roper vs. McCook, 7 Ala. 319. Norvell vs. Johnson, 5 Humph. 489. Though it is remarkable, as an examination of the cases in the western States woul show, that the two escriptions of lien, though so entirely issimilar, are often confoune.
At the time the lans were sol upon execution of the jugment at law obtaine by Irvin against Blackmore, the lien of the jugment uner the statute ha expire; but the sale uner the junior jugment of Aners & Horner, uner which Aners purchase, was within three years from its renition: an although the sale of lan uner a junior jugment only passes the title of the efenant, subject to the lien of any prior jugment in force, yet the lien of Irvin’s jugment ha cease to be in force when he purchase uner it, an the jugment creitors being entitle to no equitable preferences as against each other, but having to stan or fall accoring to their legal priorities, it follows that if the lans ha been the absolute property of Blackmore, as between the two purchasers it is clear that they woul belong to Aners. An it is argue for him, that if Irvin stans in the place of the original venor, then by his purchase of the lans uner his jugment against Blackmore, there was a merger of the equitable title of the jugment ebtor into the legal title hel or represente by Irvin, whereby Irvin, having acquire both the legal an equitable estate, has no cause of complaint, an is not entitle to any relief. We apprehen that uner our statute, Digest, Title, Execution, sec. 25, which subjects to execution “all real estate, whether patente or not, whereof the efenant or any person for his use was seize, at law or in equity, on the ay of the renition of the jugment, orer or ecree, whereon execution issue, or at any time thereafter;” that Blackmore ha such an interest in the lans as was subject to execution upon any jugment renere against him. Even if he were not in possession, or ha not pai any portion of the purchase money, yet accoring to Smith vs. Robinson, the law regars the purchaser uner an execute contract of sale, evience by a bon for title, as the real owner of the lan, subject to an incumbrance for the purchase money, an occupying the position of a mortgager, who has iveste himself of the nake legal title as a security for a ebt, an whose equitable or beneficial estate woul, without oubt, be boun by the lien of a jugment, an subject to execution to satisfy it. The State vs. Lawson, 1 Eng. 269. In orer to present this case most strongly in favor of Aners, let it be suppose that Bowie,the original venor, ha obtaine the senior jugment at law for the purchase money against Blackmore, an ha cause his interest in it to be sol uner execution before the lien of the jugment ha expire. In such case, it woul follow from the argument urge on behalf of Aners, that the interest of Blackmore was forever iveste, an that neither he nor any venee of his, or purchaser uner execution against him, who ha thereby become subrogate to his rights, coul have been entitle to reeem. The enquiry, what effect the sale of the mortgage premises upon execution of a jugment at law for the mortgage ebt woul have, accoring to the laws of this State, upon the mortgager’s equity of reemption, allue to in the case of Price vs. The State Bank, at July term, 1853, might be the subject of an extene examination. We have no statute regulating the moe, sometimes resorte to elsewhere, of barring the equity of reemption by sale uner a power; nor is the consieration of this case affecte by any question, how far the equity of reemption of the venee, uner a bon for title, may be barre by a stipulation in the instrument, making the time of payment the essence of the contract, or whereby a forfeiture is agree upon, in the event the purchase money be not punctually pai. Avoiing any such consierations, which coul only be averte to by way of illustration, it must suffice to express our opinion of the law, as applicable to the particular case before us, an upon the facts state.
The substance of the statute concerning “mortgages,” is set out in Price vs. The State Bank. Upon any fair an equitable interpretation of that statute, our opinion is against the power of the mortgagee to foreclose the equity oí reemption, by a sale of the mortgage premises, uner execution of a jugment at law, for the ebt secure by the mortgage. It might be questionable whether such a sale, where the purchase is mae by a thir person, woul not operate to transfer to him the entire claim of the mortgagee upon the lan, that is, the right to have a foreclosure, or what is equivalent, to receive the benefit resulting from the reemption. An it might be true that a thir person, purchasing at such sale, woul become subrogate, by operation of law to the mortgager’s right to reeem. So that the purchaser, in such case, might possibly acquire the title, as against both the plaintiff an efenant in the execution. But a purchase of the mortgage premises by the plaintiff in execution, that is to say, the holer of the mortgage ebt coul not bar the equity of reemption subsisting in the mortgager: an in no event, whether the purchase be mae by the plaintiff in execution, or by a stranger, woul it have the effect to bar the equity of reemption, acquire from the mortgager by an intermeiate purchaser or incumbrancer, whose right to reeem woul not be cut off by execution of the jugment at law, to which they were not parties. As there ought to be a mutuality of rights, it follows, that the mortgagee is not preclue, by his purchase of the mortgager’s estate uner execution at law, from going into equity uner the statute, to have a foreclosure, thereby opening the foreclosure, an letting in all the equities of the mortgager, even if any oubt before existe concerning them. We have seen that Irvin’s purchase uner his jugment, after the lien of it ha expire, was a nugatory act, an of itself gave him no rights at law as against Aners, who claime uner Blackmore. But his right, erive by assignment from the venor, to subject to the payment of the original purchase money, the lan in question, whether hel by Blackmore or any one claiming uner him, an who of necessity acquire it with notice oí the conition upon which the title was to emanate from the venor, continue unimpaire, unless we hel that the mortgagee, suing at law, is preclue thereby from having a foreclosure.
Finally, it is argue for Aners, that by the law in force, five years being the limitation upon a writing obligatory, an Irvin’s bill of complaint not having been exhibite until six years after the writing obligatory assigne to him, fell ue, his right to subject the lan in question to the payment of it, is barre in equity by analogy to the statute at law; an that the jugment at law, obtaine by Irvin against Blackmore, an in a istinct proceeing, is no juicial ascertainment of the ebt as against Aners.
Until the ecisions of this court, beginning with Dickerson vs. Morrison, 1 Eng. 266, followe in Davis vs. Sullivan, 2 ib. 449, an Bir vs. Smith, 3 ib. 368, it 'was oubtful whether, until the passage of the act of December, 1844, there was any statute affecting the limitation to actions on writings obligatory, other than the presumption of payment arising after the lapse of ten years, accoring to sec. 31, of the Revise Statutes of 1839; but those ecisions i authoritatively settle the law, as now claime for the appellee. But for the reason that he is not affecte by the inepenent jugment against Blackmore, he can claim no immunity from it. No oubt exists, uner the statute of limitations applicable to these transactions, that the right of the mortgagee to assert an enforce his lien upon the lan by a bill to foreclose, woul not be barre until ten years from the time the right to foreclose accrue: because he woul have that time within which to bring ejectment at law, an for aught that appears, the ¡possession of the venee, being consistent with his contract of purchase, by no possibility coul a title by length of averse possession have become mature as against the venor, within a shorter perio. That the venor, who gives a bon for title, may bring ejectment on failure of the venee to comply with the conition of the bon by the payment of the purchase money, is fully establishe by Brown vs. Morrison & Sullivan, an Fears vs. Merrill, 4 Eng. 459: nor is any notice to quit necessary, accoring to Smith vs. Robinson. By analogy therefore to the limitation at law, we hol that the bill in this case, to subject the lans in'question to the payment of the original purchase money, was well brought within ten years from the maturity of the writing obligatory, execute by Blackmore, for its payment; an so the converse of this woul be law; that Aners, if uner ifferent circumstances it ha become important to his rights, woul have ha a like perio, within which to reeem.
Upon the facts allege in the bill, the complainant, Irvin, was entitle to the relief praye for. The ecree of the chancellor is therefore reverse, an the cause will be remane with instructions to overrule the emurrer, an for further proceeings.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
On the first ay of the April term 1845 of the Pulaski-Circuit-Court, the appellant became the purchaser of the lan in controversy. It was sol as the property of Moses Ferguson, by virtue-of an execution, against him an one Michael Hogan, in favor of one Nathaniel Migett, upon a jugment obtaine in May, 1843. During that term the appellant obtaine a writ of possession upon his motion, to which Moses Ferguson appeare; From the jugment of the Pulaski Circuit Court granting the writ of possession, an appeal was taken to this court, where .in the month of October, 1845, the jugment of the Pulaski court was-affirme. (1 Eng. R. 297.)
In the meantime, in the month of August, 1845, Mary Ferguson, as wiow, an Moses Ferguson an others, as heirs of Joseph Ferguson, ecease, file a bill in chancery against the appellant an the heirs of Sampson Gray, ecease, alleging that on the 5th of November, 1827, the sheriff of Pulaski county, in the then Territory of Arkansas, sol the lan in controversy, in ue course of law, for taxes, to the sai Sampson Gray, an execute to him the prescribe certificate of purchase; that Gray sol, the lan to the sai Joseph Ferguson for the sum of $-- “in-han, pai by the sai Joseph to the sai Sampson,” with the express unerstaning an agreement that he, Gray, woul convey the lan by ee as soon as he shoul himself receive one from the sheriff in pursuance of law an in accorance with his certificate; but that Gray eparte this life before receiving such ee-from-the sheriff, an before making one to the sai Joseph Ferguson: that by virtue of the aforesai sale an agreement, Joseph Ferguson took possession of the lan, an use an occupie it by putting his son, Moses Ferguson, in the possession an quiet enjoyment of the same: that Moses ha continue to hol-that possession, without averse claim from any one, up to the - 2 of April, 1836, when the sai Joseph eparte this life, an' that since the eath of Joseph, Moses ha continue in- the possession by the consent an permission of the heirs an aminisirator of the sai Joseph: that in April, 1845, the lan ha been, sol by execution as the property of Moses, an that the appellant Blakeney became the purchaser, who ha receive a ee .for it from the sheriff of Pulaski county, conveying all the title .an interest of the sai Moses.
The bill, upon these allege facts, procees to pray the court to ecree to the heirs at law of Joseph Ferguson, a vali an sufficient •title in law an equity to the tract of lan in question, upon conition that they allot to the wiow, one thir part as a ower estate, an convey to the appellant, Blakeney, an univie sixth part of the resiue, or pay him an equivalent in money, the sai ■sixth part being the allege interest of Moses in the lan.
To this bill, Blakeney interpose a emurrer assigning for cause; 1st, That there was no equity upon the face of the bill. 2? That complainants showe no title to the lan, but a parol agreement between Gray an Joseph Ferguson, which is forbien by the statute of fraus. 3, No facts to take the case out of the statute. 4th, No money pai in part performance. 5th, That the agreement was without consieration an voi.
The Circuit Court overrule the emurrer, an renere a final •ecree in favor of complainants as to Blakeney, an an interlocutory one as to .the heirs of Gray, who were uly summone, but mae efault. Blakeney appeale to this court, an upon a hearing here, ¡at the January term, 1848, it washel that the facts •allege were .sufficient to take the case out of the statute of fraus, but that the allegations were not sufficient to show title in Gray. An the ecree appeale from was reverse, an the cause remane to be proceee with accoring to the principles of equity, an not inconsistent with the opinion herein elivere. (3 Eng. R. 272.)
While this cause was pening in the Circuit Court, an immeiately after the ecision of this court, in October, 1845, affirming the jugment of the Pulaski Circuit Court, in the matter of the writ of possession, the same complainants, Mary Ferguson an others, file their petition in the Pulaski Circuit Court, alleging that they ha, on the 28th of August, 1845, file the before mentione bill of complaint, .an praying that a copy thereof, which they exhibite, might be taken as a part of their petition: that the efenants ha been serve with process of subpoena; that the lan in question ha been sol as aforesai, an purchase by Blakeney; that the latter ha obtaine an orer of possession; that the orer ha been appeale from to this court, where the jugment of the Circuit Court in the premises ha been affirme. An upon these allege facts, verifie by affiavit, praye that the appellant, Blakeney, shoul be enjoine from all further proceeings with his writ of possession (the awar of which ha been so affirme by this court,) until their bill aforesai shoul be finally hear an etermine. This prayer was resiste by Blakeney, but his resistance was of no avail, an the injunction was aware. Afterwars he interpose a emurrer to the petition an assigne for cause: 1st, That there was no equity upon the face of the petition. 2, That it was an attempt to re-investigate a matter alreay etermine by this court, without any showing of further facts or new matter. 3, That the petition allege no title to the lan, but set up a parol agreement with regar thereto. 4th, That no sufficient facts were allege to take the case out of the statute of fraus. 5th, That no gum of money was allege to have been pai in part performance. 6th, That upon the face of the petition, the allege agreement appears to have been mae without consieration, an is therefore voi, irrespective of the statute. 7th, That inasmuch as there is failure of any allegation of title, there is no groun ppon which to base partition. 8th, That if on the other han, title be allege, then there is an aequate remey at law.
Upon argument, the emurrer was overrule, an the appellant, Blakeney, eclining to plea to, or answer the petition, the injunction was perpetuate, an Blakeney appeale to this court, where upon a hearing at the January term, 1849, the ecree of the Pulaski Circuit Court, perpetuating the injunction, was reverse, an the cause remane to be proceee with, accoring to the principles of equity, an not inconsistent with the opinion therein elivere, (4 Eng.

•In the meantime, the same complainants, at the October term, 1848, of the Pulaski Circuit Court, ha file an amene bill as a substitute for their original bill, hel ba on emurrer by this court, at the January term, 1848, alleging with exceeing minuteness the peformanee of every pre-requisite for a vali sale for taxes uner the territorial statute, from its inception up to an incluing the issuance of the certificate of purchase to Sampson Gray in the year 1827: that in 1828, before obtaining the sheriff’s ee in pursuance of the certificate, Gray sol the lan to Joseph Ferguson for the sum of fifty ollars, an receive the money therefor; an agree that he woul procure such ee an convey all his right, title an interest in the lan to the sai Joseph, an at the same time place the latter in possession thereof, in pursuance of this contract: that no person offere to reeem the lan within the time prescribe by the statute: that Gray having eparte this life before receiving such ee, mae none to Joseph: that the representatives of Gray, after his eath elivere to Joseph the certificate of purchase, uner which an in pursuance of the contract of sale to him aforesai, he continue to hol possession: that in 1831, Joseph place his son Moses in possession of the lan as his tenant, who occupie as such until the eath of Joseph, in 1836: that ever since then Moses has hel the possession, by the consent an permission of the legal representatives an heirs at law of Joseph, subject to the rights of the latter, an of the wiow; with the unerstaning an agreement that he woul yiel possession whenever require for the purpose of assigning ower an making partition. The bill then sets out the levy an sale, as the property of Moses, an the purchase by, an conveyance to the appellant, Blakeney, by the sheriff, Boren, of all the right, title an interest of Moses. An totheallege en, that the title to the lan in controversy may be quiete an veste in the proper owner thereof, an partition be mae, conclues with a prayer that the court will ecree a vali an sufficient title in law an equity to the heirs at law, upon conition that they assign ower to the wiow, an convey to Blakeney one-sixth part of the resiue, or pay him an equivalent in money, if actual partition be impracticable.
In February, 1849, Blakeney answere this amene bill, enying every material allegation as to the sale of the lan for taxes; an the subsequent sale by Gray, to Joseph Ferguson, an the latter’s possession uner the allege contract of sale: pleas that if any such sale an contract were mae, it was within the statute of fraus, an no sufficient facts to take it without the statute: enies the elivery of the certificate of purchase to Joseph Ferguson, or that he ever hel uner it; amits that Moses Ferguson hel the quiet possession of the lan in 1831, an before an afterwars, up to an after the commencement of this suit, but enies that he hel as tenant of Joseph uring the lifetime of the latter, or by consent an permission of the complainants since, but avers that he hel it as his own absolute property; avers that in 1837 or 1838, Moses, then in possession, offere to sell the lan to the responent, an was regare in the community as the owner', an that nothing to the contrary was ever hear until responent’s purchase at sheriff's sale; avers that the owner of the lan, when it was sol for taxes, resie in the Territory of Arkansas, an continue to resie here, uring the time when Moses Ferguson hel the possession, for a sufficient length of time to give Moses a complete title uner the statute of limitations, which veste in responent by virtue of his purchase at sheriff’s sale, of the interest an estate of Moses therein: amits the sale an his purchase uner the execution, an relies upon it, an pleas that he is an innocent purchaser, for a valuable consieration: avers that there is no equity on the face of this amene bill, an that no such title has been allege by the complainants, as to entitle them to partition. The answer is verifie by affiavit.
Hamilton Reynols also answere for himself, an, by a separate answer, as guarian for the minor heirs of Sampson Gray, ecease, an amits upon information aii belief that the lan was sol for taxes an purchase by Gray, ecease, an sol by him as allege in the bill: amits the eath of Gray, the elivery of the certificate of purchase, afterwars, by his heirs at law an legal representatives, to Joseph ; that Joseph Ferguson place Moses in the possession as allege : that the interest of Moseswas sol uner execution an purchase by Blakeney: that he intei’marrie with the wiow of Gray, an is guarian for the minor heirs, an claims no interest either in right of his wife, or as guarian, or otherwise. In his answer as guarian, he makes a formal enial of the allegations of the bill an requires proof.
The eath of Henry C. Gray after the commencement of the suit was suggeste, an a ecree pro confesso taken against the other efenants in efault. Replications having been file, is-sue was regularly forme, the cause set own for final hearing,- an an orer for eposition regularly mae. Afterwars, on-motion, upon no other showing than the face of the bill an answer in, the name of Moses Ferguson was stricken out as a plaintiff an he was mae a co-efenant, an his eposition orere to-be taken; to which Blakeney excepte. Moses answere an amitte all the material allegations of the amene bill. Various exceptions were taken to the epositions, which it is unnecessary to notice, for any other purpose than to remark that numerous-affiavits were brought in pro an con, an several of them wererule out an retaken.
At this stage of the proceeings, on the 12th of February, 1-850,, the manate of this court, upon the reversal of the ecree of the Circuit Court, which perpetuate the injunction of Blakeney from proceeing with his writ of possession, was file, an a motion-mae to issolve the injunction in accorance therewith; an for an orer of possession.
Three ays afterwars, to wit: on the 15th of February, 1850, the complainant file an amene petition for an injunction, which varie nothing material from the, original one, otherwise than by incorporating the amene bill in lieu of the original bill an praye that the injunction might be continue until the final hearingof the bill an then perpetuate. On the 9th of Aug., 1851, the motion to-issolve the injunction an the petition to continue it, came on to be hear — -they seeming to have slumbere in the meantime. The former was overrule an the latter grante» an the two causes consoliate an orere to progress to final heai'ing together as one cause, all against the objection of Blakeney, to which he file his bill of exceptions. Ultimately, on the 21st January, 1852, after the exceptions of Blakeney to the epositions of William Sauners, James Erwin an Moses Ferguson, taken on the 12th an 13th of December, 18^1, on the part of the complainant, ha been overrule, the cause came on for final hearing upon the amene bill an exhibits, the amene petition an all the answers an replications, the epositions above mentione an those of Samuel M. Rutherfor an William E. Wooruff, taken on the 13th an 11th of January, 1851, (to which exceptions ha been before overrule an save) an the exhib- . its referre to in sai eposition. Whereupon it was ecree that the lan in controversy shoul be sol for cash by a commissioner of the court, that out of the procees he shoul pay all the costs accrue in the Circuit Court in these causes, an out of the balance pay the appellant Blakeney one-sixth part, an pay' the resiue into that court, subject to its future orer. But that in the event the procees of the sale shoul be insufficient to pay all these costs, that Blakeney shoul pay one-sixth part of the eficit an the complainants the resiue; an that the injunction against- Blakeney from proceeing with his orer of possession shoul be perpetuate. To all of which Blakeney excepte an has appeale to this court.
Thus at the en of about eight years from their inception, these voluminous proceeings were brought to an en in the Circuit Court, after having been in the meantime before this court for correction three several times; an it may be remarke as to the result, that this is not only materially variant from the ostensible object of the complainants, in procuring by ecree title to the lan in law an equity, an ower estate for the wiow, but is oppressive upon the efenant, in putting heavy costs upon him, accumulate by the errors an imperfections of the plaintiff’s anomalous proceeings; while at the same time, the efenant, uring most of this long perio of time, has been kept out of his finally ajuge right to his writ of possession, an its fruits, by the totally unauthorize use of the writ of injunction, as appears, throughout the proceeings, by the complainants’ own showing. There was no allegation or pretence that the complainants ever feare any waste, or'any injury at all to the 1 an in controversy, much loss that the efenant ha threatene any such irreparable mischief, as it is the object of an injunction to prevent; while at the same time they expressly showe that the efenant claime by averse title, an as between him an them, the title was at least ispute, if not oubtful. (6 Ves. R. 89, i. 51.
Although the appellant may not avail himself of any objection to the ecree relating to title or ower, because he may not be injure thereby, or for its failure to compensate him for the legitimate fruits of his writ of possession, of which he has so long been eprive by this clear abuse of the writ of injunction, because he has not so shape his efence as to make this objection available to him in this way, he may nevertheless, at least claim in this court to be release from the onerous weight of the excessive costs, which the complainants’ anomalous an imperfect process has accumulate in the case, beyon the legitimate costs ot such a proceeing, (Dig. ch. 40, see. 25, p. 284.
Passing by the various objections to the epositions, upon which this cause was trie, an which are save by the appellants’ bill of exceptions, as well as some other points of minor importance that have been suggeste we shall procee at once to a conclusive objection to the ecree, which is ecisive of this cause.
The complainants come into court upon a erivative title, setting up that they are the wiow an heirs at law of Joseph Ferguson, ecease, an make their claim as such uner him. This was a material part of their case. It was inee of the very gist of their bill. The efenant answere, enying seriatim almost every other allegation. Prefacing his answer with the usual reservation, an concluing it, after a enial in terms of any “such title in the complainants or any of them as entitle them to partition,” with the usual formula “without this,” &c. To this the complainants, without any exception for insufficiency or other cause, interpose their replication in short upon the recor by consent: the language of which, in the preceents, is that “these repliants say, that they will aver an prove their sai bill to bo true, certain,” &c., an “that the sai answer is uncertain, mi true, &c. All which matters an things these repliants are, an will be, reay to aver an prove,” &c.
At the hearing, no proof was offere to establish that the complainants were the wiow an heirs of Joseph Ferguson, ecease, other than the answer of Moses Ferguson; an the first question is, whether therefore, these material facts were amitte by the answer of Blakeney, the appellant.
Accoring to the theory of a proceeing in equity, the bill although sworn to, is never, at the hearing, evience for the complainant in any other sense than as an amission of the efenant, either express or implie. It oes not recognize the right of the complainant to become a witness in his own behalf, but to compel the efenant to become a witness in the cause, to the extent of a response to every allegation in the bill, an, in general, to confess or eny every one of those, the amission oí the truth of which may entitle the complainant to his legitimate relief. The effect of a total failure to answer, is an amission that the whole bill is true, if the efenant continues in this contempt, of the consequences of which he was warne originally before this effect was absolute; of which there are equivalent provisions in our statute. But it oes not follow from this, that a partial failure to answer amits the fact unanswere to be true, without any warning at all. On the contrary, if upon exceptions sustaine to such an answer, the efenant fails to answer further, instea of the part unanswere being taken as true at all as such, the whole bill is taken pro confesso generally; precisely as if no answer at all ha been offere, (Jopling vs. Stewart, 4 Ves. 619; Turner vs. Gray, ib. in note, an other cases there cite;) an thus the efenant is allowe time an opportunity for repentance as before. In harmony with this is the formula of reservation, at the commencement of the answer, which it is sai in 2 Ma. Ch. 333, was probably intene to prevent a conclusion that the e^ fenant having submitte to answer the bill, amitte everything which by his answer he i not, in express terms, controvert. An also the rule of allowing the plaintiff to except to an answer for insufficiency, not only when the efenant fails to iscover, but when he fails to amit or eny, or evaes any material allegation. If the effect of a partial answer be, to amit the truth of the part unanswere, why except at all? Such an effect woul be equivalent to an answer expressly amitting the part unanswere, an therefore make exceptions unnecessary.
These exceptions serve to give notice to the efenant of matters which may, without esign, have escape his attention, or have not sufficiently arreste it, an enable him to o what he woul have otherwise one, an thus save him from surprise. An certainly, in such cases he is more entitle to warning than when in contempt for failing to answer at all,-or to make further answer upon exceptions sustaine for insufficiency.
Inasmuch then, as when there is a total failure to answer, the complainant can by pro confesso get an implie amission of his whole bill; an equally so, when, upon exception sustaine, there is a failure to answer further; an as he can require this as well as in ai of his proofs, or to avoi expense, as in cases where he cannot prove the facts at all otherwise than by a iscovery; an as the opposite coul not be otherwise than mischievous, in often resulting in surprise to the efenant, it seems far more reasonable that after replication without exception to an answer, which may fall short of a perfect one, the complainant shoul be hel to have ispense with the benefits of a better one, an thereby to have relie upon his own proofs; than that the efenant shoul be hel to have amitte the truth without warning of what might have, without esign, escape his notice.
An to this effect is the ecie weight of authority, qualifie however in some of the cases by an exception, where the omitte or evae fact may be prima facie within the knowlege of the efenant, (Cochran vs. Couper am’r, 1 Harrington R. 202. Tate vs. Conner, 2 Dev. Ch R. 224. Lum vs. Johnson, 3 Ireell Ch. R. 70. Young vs. Gruny, 6 Cranch. 51. Coleman vs. Lyne’s Ex’r, 4 Ran. R. 456. Cropper vs. Barton, 5 Leigh R. 432. Stewart vs. Strong, 3 Gill & John. 510. Joice vs. Tayloe, 6 Gill & John. 54.)
But any exception woul seem to be a eparture from the principle an policy of equity practice, an of mischievous tenency. In Kentucky, where the exception prevails, it was hel in the case of Owings vs. Patterson et al., 1 A. K, Marsh. R. 325, in which the complainants claime title to lan as the heirs at law of Patterson, an from the generality an vagueness of the answer, the court was unable to etermine whether or not the efenants intene to put the heirship in issue, that the proof of that material ingreient in the complainant’s case was upon them at the hearing, an for want of it in the recor, reverse the ecree in their favor for that cause alone.
In the light of these views an of the authorities that we have examine an cite above, we have no oubt but that it was incumbent upon the complainants below in this case, to prove at the hearing that they were the wiow an heirs at law of Joseph Ferguson, ecease, uner whom they set up their claim for relief, an so hol.
The question is then presente, whether or not the answer of Moses Ferguson, in which these facts are expressly amitte, was evience to this point against his co-efenant Blakeney, the appellant. An waiving any question as to whether he was properly any party at all, we shall procee at once to this inquiry.
We have alreay seen that the operatioir of an answer, as evience for the complainant is by way of amission. So, Juge Story sai, in Reimsyke vs. Kane, (1 Gall. R. 636,) when speaking of the amissions of one co-partner, which bin another, “an answer is no more than an amission, though a very solemn one.” “But an amission in an answer is something more than evience: it is a concession in pleaing, which requires no corroborating, an allows of no countervailing proofs,” as was remarke by Juge Balwin, in the ease of Pettit vs. Jennings, 2 Robt. Va. R. 684. An hence upon the reasonable founation that no one can amit in evience, or concee in pleaing for another, except in these cases where he is so combine with that other, either legally or by frau, that the act of one is the act of the other, rest the unquestionable general rule an its exceptions: that the separate answer of one or more efenants cannot be rea in evience to sustain the complainants’ bill against a co-efenant.
If it were otherwise, a complainant might so frame his bill, as-to elicit evience from one efenant to charge another, an to-exclue such matters as might ischarge him. An the evience thus obtaine woul be obnoxious to the objections against leaing questions, an of being use against a party eprive of the-important privilege of cross-examination, whereby the complainant woul have unue avantages against the most-- manifest principles of impartial justice. Inee it woul place an assignee or venee completely in the power of his assignor or venor, an subj ect him to the anger of being mae the helpless victim of a frauulent collusion. Nor oes any failure of justice result from rejecting the answer of one efenant as evience against a co-efenant, because the complainant oes not eprive himself of the testimony of one efenant against another by his act,, of associating them together as efenants, as in a court of law. If he be not incompetent, or privilege by reason of his interest, the complainant may still examine him as a witness. If he be so, however, his answer can avail the complainant nothing, unless he has amitte it in the allegation sought to be prove. An when he has one so, he is no longer privilege, because he has alreay given evience against himself.
In the case last cite, upon the question, whether the answer of the assignor of a bon amitting the gaming consieration allege in the bill, coul be rea in evience against his co-efenant an his assignee, who ha enie all knowlege of it, the octrine we are examining was gone into at large, both upon principle an authority; an it was expressly foun by the Virginia court, that the same principles which govern amissions in pais, whether verbal or written, or mae in a former suit, to which the party against whom they were offere was not a party, whether by pleaing or evience or otherwise, govern also, in like manner, an amission in the answer of one efenant in a pening suit, when offere as evience against his co-efenant.
To the samo effect was the conclusion of the Illinois court, in Ihe case of Martin vs. Dryen et al., (1 Gillman R 209,) in a case where the venor an venee of lan were efenants, when they sai, “A better test to etermine when such an answer woul be evience against a co-efenant claiming uner him, or in the same right, as in the case of partners, or successors, is an answer to the question, woul his amissions be evience? Wherever the latter woul be amissible, a fortiori, woul his answer.” To the same effect is the language of Juge Story, in Reimsyke vs. Kane et al., 1 Gall. R. 635.
It is accoringly lai own in Mr. Aam’s excellent work on the octrines of Equity, page 20, that “The iscovery obtaine by a bill in equity is only available against the answering efenant. It cannot be rea in evience against a co-efenant, unless he refers to it by his answer as correct, or is so connecte with the answering party as to be boun; uner the, orinary rules of law, by his eclarations an amissions.” For this he cites Mitf. 188; Anon. 1 P. Wm. 301; Chewes vs. Jones, 6 Ma. 267; Crope vs. Reinfiel, 12 Sim. 35; an Green vs. Pleger 3 Hare 165. To which the American Eitors appen numerous American cases, incluing the States of Maine, Vermont, New York, Mississippi, Virginia, Alabama an Marylan; to which they say numerous other cases may be ae.
It has been suppose, however, that the “rule oes not apply to cases where the efenant claims through him whose answer is offere in evience,” as is lai own in Greenleaf’s work on Evience, p. 210, sec. 178: or, as it is elsewhere expresse, “Where one efenant succees to another, so that the right of the one evolves on the other, an they become privies in estate,” per Chief Justice Marshall, in Osborn vs. The Bk. of the U. States, 9 Wheat. R. 332.
This last mentione case an that of Fiel vs. Hollan, 6 Cranch. R. 21, are the only two cases, besies those that have followe them as authority,)’ that give any sanction by this sup pose exception. These two cases were cite by the court of appeals of Marylan in the year 1839, as an authority upon a point like that we are now consiering, an that court ispose of them with the following language: “We have given to them a thorough examination an respectful consieration, but not being convince of their correctness by the reason assigne in their support, an being unable to reconcile them to an otherwise unbroken series of authorities, both English an American, we o not hol ourselves boun to conform to them. (Jones vs. Haresly et al, 10 Gill & John. R. at p. 415.)
The ecision of the Marylan court upon this point, was approve, as a “well consiere” one, by Chancellor Walworth, in the case of Cristie vs. Bishop, (1 Barbour's Ch. R. at p. 121,) * where the assignor an assignee of a jugment were the parties efenant to a bill alleging usury in the original transaction an the subsequent premiums for insurance; an the question was whether the answer of the former, amitting the truth of the allegation, coul be rea in evience against the latter, who enie all knowlege as to all or any of the matters in the bill, except some unimportant particulars ; an he thus procees to remark upon these two ecisions of the Supreme Court at Washington, which was cite to him as authority, “There are inee two cases in which the late Chief Justice Marshall is suppose to have expresse an opinion, that the rule, that the answer of one efenant coul not be rea in evience against another, except when they hol a join interest, oes not apply to the case of a efenant who has erive title to the subject matter of litigation, uner or through the one whose answer is offere in evience against such efenant. (Fiel vs. Hollan, 6 Cranch. 24; Osborn vs. U. S. Bank, 9 Wheat. 332.) An 1 see that the first of these cases is referre to by Professor Greenleaf, in his recent very valuable treatise on the law of Evience, (Greenl. Ev. p. 210, sec. 178,) as sustaining the same principle.
“la the case of Fiel vs. Hollan, this precise question was not before the court; an the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall only goes to the point, that the answer of a efenant, through whom the co-efenant claims, is evience in favor of seh co-efenant, as to matters which both were calle on to answer, in relation to transactions which took place before the sale to such co-efenant. -It may perhaps be inferre from the language of the Chief Justice in that ease, that if the answer of Hollan ha amitte the facts charge in the complainant’s bill, instea of enying them, it coul have been use as evience against his co-efenant, who ha purchase uner the jugment in his favor .againt Cox. But there certainly was nothing to authorize the reporter, in the syllabus of the ecision in that case, to state, as ,a point ecie by the court, that the answer of one-efenant is evience against other efenants claiming through him. In the case of Osborne vs. The U. S. Bank, the question arose as to how far the answer of one treasurer of the State of Ohio, was .evience against his successor in office, as to the ientity of funs taken from the Bank by a former treasurer; both being joine as efenants in the same bill. An in reference to the principle of evience, that the answer of one efenant cannot be rea in evience against another, Ch. J. Marshall says, “This is generally, but not universally true. Where one efenant succees to another, so that the right of the one evolves on the other, an they become privies in estate, the rule is not amitte to apply. Thus, if an ancestor ie pening a suit, an the proceeings be revive against his heir', or if a suit be revive against an executor or aministrator, the answer of the ecease person, or any other evience establishing any other fact against him, might be rea also against the person who succees to him.” An it certainly seems to have been the opinion of the court in that case, that these principles, the correctness of which no one can ispute, were applicable to the case, of an answer put in by a efenant, who ha parte with all interest in the subject matter of litigation, previous to the commencement of a suit, to one who was afterwars mae a co-efenant with him in such suit. But there is a manifest ifference between that case an the case suppose in the opinion of the learne Chief Justice. For in the case suppose, the ancestor or of the ecease party, is an amission mae by him while he was owner of the subject matter of litigation an was such as may be given in evience against any person claiming title uner him subsequent to such amission. An upon the same principle, if a bill is taken as confesse against a efenant before his eath, an the suit is subsequently revive against his heir, or personal representative, they must apply to vacate the orer taking the bill as confesse, if they wish to controvert the allegations in the bill, or set up any efence except such as has arisen subsequent to that orer. For the sufficiency of the bill to be taken as confesse against him, was an amission by the original efenant, while he was alone intereste in the subject matter of the litigation, that the allegations in the complainant’s bill were true, an that he ha no vali efence to the claim mae by the complainant, except such as appeare from the bill itself. The question, however, now uner consieration, i not necessarily arise in the case of Osborn vs. The U. S. Bank, because the answer of Sullivan, the successor of Currie, containe a istinct amission that he receive the money in controversy from Currie, his preecessor in office, who informe him at the time he elivere the money that it was the money which ha been taken from the bank — that answer was therefore of itself on ience of the ientity of the funs — for it containe evience of the eclaration of the former treasurer, mae at the time he parte with the money to his successor. It was not therefore evience of a eclaration of the treasurer, after he ha parte with all his interest in the fun to the efenant Sullivan. An as I unerstan the case, the ecision of the court is place upon that groun: though it is evient the opinion of the learne Chief Justice, was that the answer of Currie, uner the circumstances of the case, was amissible in evience as against a co-efenant.”
The case was, that before the money in controversy ha been taken from the Bank, a subpoena in chancery, an an injunction ha been serve upon Osborne, the Auitor, whose uty it was to execute tbe act of the Ohio Legislature, uner the specific provisions of which, the money was afterwars taken by his agent, the collector of the revenue, with a full knowlege that the orer for the injunction ha been mae. By this agent the money was elivere to Currie, the Treasurer, who, after keeping it a few ays, transferre its possession to Sullivan, his successor in office. The bill was afterwars amene, alleging the facts that ha transpire subsequently to the orer for the injunction, an Currie an Sullivan mae co-efenants with Osborne.
When in connection with this State of the case, the whole of the remarks of Chief Justice Marshall, are consiere, (as well as those quote by the learne Chancellor, as those which immeiately follow them,) it will not appear improbable but that the Chief Justice esigne them all to apply only to efenants, who succeee to rights or purchase the subject matter of litigation penente lite; an that he regare the case before him as, substantially, one of that character. If so, although the learne chancellor is oubtless to be sustaine in his unerstaning of the true groun upon which the court ecie the cause — that of the answer of Sullivan alone, whereby all that is sai of the amissibility of Currie’s answer, is left as the ictum only of the Chief Justice — his impressions as to the extent of the view's of 'the latter woul be too latituinous. While-the more limite scope suggeste for them, if sustainable woul relieve those views from the otherwise just imputation of heterooxy cast upon them by the learne chancellor.
In the case of Pettit vs. Jennings, alreay cite, the court of appeals of Virginia, after coincient views with those of Chancellor Walworth, as to the eparture of the case of Fiel vs. Hollan, from settle principles an unbroken authority, when taken to have gone the extent of ruling that the answer of Hollan woul be evience against his co-efenants claiming through an uner him, ha it amitte instea of enying the allegations of the bill, as has been inferre, an is state in the syllabus of the reporter, which they pronounce “wrong” as to this: procees to give a version of the case, which relieves it from all criticism, as follows': “The principle of this ecision is not that the answer of a efenant is evience for the plaintiff' against a co-efenant, but that, when responsive to the bill it is evience against the plaintiff for the responing efenant, an enures to the benefit of his co-efenant, claiming uner him, when it estroys the founation of the plaintiff’s claim. The language of the court is as follows: ‘Neither is it to be amitte that the answer of Hollan is not testimony against the plaintiffs. He is the party against whom the fact, that the jugments were ischarge, is to be establishe, an against whom it is to operate. This fact, when establishe, it is true, affects the purchasers also; but it affects them consequentially an through him. It affects them as representing him. Consequently, when the fact is establishe against or for him, it bins them. The plaintiffs themselves call upon Hollan for a iscovery. They aver that the jugments were ischarge an expressly require him to answer this allegation. They cannot now be allowe to say that this answer is no testimony.’ It will be seen that the reasoning of the court is at first somewhat inefinite; we presume for the purpose of avoiing the very inference which has been erroneously rawn from it. Its object was to show, in the first place, that the fact of the payment or non-payment of the jugment, when properly establishe, woul not only be evience for or against the plaintiff therein, but woul operate for or against the purchasers, (who were the co-efenants) uner the authority thereof; at the same time avoiing the esignation of the moe by which that fact, whether affirmative or negative, ivas to be establishe; an then to show that in the case before the court it was establishe negatively by the responsive answer of the efenant, Hollan. There coul be no propriety .in intimating any opinion as to what woul be the effect of a irectly opposite state of facts, to wit: an amission by the efenant Hollan in his answer of the allegations in the bill, an in fact no such opinion was intimate.” Pettit vs. Jennings, 2 Robt. Va. R. at p. 682.
These two cases of Fiel vs. Hollan, an Osborn vs. The Bank of the U. States being then ispose of, there are no other cases in the Unite States, except a few that have been ecie expressly upon their suppose authority, which give any color, as we have alreay remarke, to the suppose exception to the general rule, which we have been examining. An Chancellor Walworth, after bis criticisms upon these two cases, an an elaborate examination of the various ecisions to the contrary, remarks, “I have not been able to fin any case in the reports of the court of chancery in Englan or in Irelan, in which the answer of one efenant has been permitte to be rea in evience against another, except in those cases where the efenants were combine, either legally or frauulently, so as to create a unity of interest between them.” (Christie vs. Bishop, 1 Barb. Ch. Rep. at p. 120.
There are other cases, however, besies that of Fiel vs. Hollan, where the answer of one efenant, in its operation against the complainant is allowe to operate also for the protection an shelter of a co-efenant. So, there are cases where the answer of the responing efenant, although in favor of the complainant, operates also for the like shelter of a co-efenant But neither class of cases in any egree violates the rule, that the answer of one efenant cannot be rea in evience against his co-efenant, or makes any exception to it, otherwise than in the merest matter of form, without any substance at alj — all being in conformity to the orinary rules of law as to confessions, eclarations an amissions. Of the former class is the American case of Mills vs. Gore, (20 Pick. R. 28,) where the protecte efenant occupie the attitue of stakeholer, having been the mutual epository of the subject matter, an upon the bill of one of the contestants was mae a co-efenant with the other, an efene himself uner his claim. Thus circumstance, he was allowe to rea the answer in his favor upon the two grouns, as the court put it, that the complainants having calle upon the responing efenant for the iscovery, he coul not be allowe to say that his answer was no evience in the cause ; an that such testimony, when in favor of a co-efenant, was not within the reason of the rule, excluing the answer of one efenant against another, because in the former case, the important privilege of cross-examination is not sacrifice as in the latter.
Of the latter class, is the English case of Greene vs. Pleger, (3 Hare’s Rep. 165,) where the case mae by the bill, was that Bernar Angle, a bankrupt, for the purpose of swinling his creitors, secretly put money in the hans of his brother, John Angle, on the security of two promissory notes 8 execute by Pleger, who knew that the money was the assets of the bankrupt: that when John Angle was summone to atten, as a witness, on the fiat against his brother, Bernar, he refuse to atten an abscone to Boulogne. The two promissory notes payable to John Angle, were taken from his possession by the messenger uner the fiat, an elivere to the complainant, who was the official an creitors’ assignee of the bankrupt: an the notes not being enorse, the complainant coul not recover upon them at law against Pleger. Pleger answere amitting his liability to John Angle, but ignore altogether the case of the complainant, not amitting that the money, as allege, was a part of the assets of the bankrupt, an submitte that if the court shoul be of opinion that the complainants were entitle to the notes, or the beneficial interest in them, that then he ought to be consiere a stakeholer an be allowe his costs. Uner an English statute, John Angle was serve at Boulogne with a subpoena to appear an answer the bill. Afterwars the vice chancellor mae an orer that the service of a notice of motion upon John Angle at Boulogne, shoul be goo service. The notice was accoringly serve, an the motion then mae, (foune upon affiavits as against John Angle) that Pleger shoul pay the money into court. John Angie i not appear, an the motion came on to be hear on the affiavits as against him, an upon the answer of Pleger to the bill alreay in. The Vice Chancellor in granting this motion, sai: “The efenant Pleger amits his liability to John Angle, an ignores only the question of right as between the plaintiff an John Angle. If John Angle were not a party to this suit, the plaintiffs woul have to join issue with Pleger upon their right as against John Angle, an woul be boun to prove that right as against Pleger. But the latter being a party, it is with him, an him only, that the plaintiffs have to litigate that right: an a ecree in the plaintiffs’ favor against John Angle will be a sufficient protection to Pleger. That it is with John Angle, the plaintiffs have to litigate that question is clear from the consieration, that an amission by John Angle in his answer, of the plaintiff’s right as against himself, woul entitle the plaintiff to a ecree accoring to the prayer of the bill. At the same time it is clear that John Angles’ answer woul not, technically speaking, be evience against Pleger. So, if the bill were taken pro confesso against John Angle, or if the plaintiffs’ rights, as against John Angle, were prove by evience not receivable against Pleger. The consequence of both John Angle an Pleger being parties to the suit is, that a ecree in the plaintiffs’ favor will ecie the case between the co-efenants. (Chamley vs. Lor Dunsancy, 2 Sch. & Lef. 718. Farquharson vs. Seton, 5 Russ, per Lor Elon,) I might refer to analogous cases, in which a isclaimer by one efenant has enable the plaintiff to sustain his suit against another efenant; the principle being, that after a ecree foune upon the isclaimer, the court will not permit the isclaiming party to open the question anew, (Leathes vs. Newitt, 3 Ea. & Go. 848. Mounsey vs. Burnham, 1 Hare 21.”) After showing him that the case before him was unlike the case of Doubless vs. Flint, (1 Myln. & Cr. 502,) the Vice Chancellor then conclues with the remark: “I want no evience but what his answer gives me, an I take nothing from him but what he amits he has no right to hol as against John Angle. Against John Angle the case is establishe, for the present purpose at least, by the affiavits, to the l'eception of which he coul not object.”
The affiavits, by which this motion was supporte, being taken, upon the hearing of the motion, as equivalent to the answer of John Angle, confessing the complainants’ equity upon the final hearing, it will be seen that this latter case iffers from the Massachusetts case, just cite, mainly in the fact, that the answer of the real litigant efenant, was offere to be rea by the complainant in the bill, instea of by the co-efenant, as in the Massachusetts case; an that, in the one case, the answer rea enie the equity of the bill, while in the English case it is taken as confessing it. But the same principle governs both cases. That it is to say, in neither was the answer rea in evience against the co-efenant. In the Massachusetts case it was not against him, because he set up no right of his own, an the answer was against the complainant an in favor of the responing efenant, in whose right he mae his efence. So, in the English case, it was not against the co-efenant, Pleger, as the Yice Chancellor labors to show by several illustrations, among others the case of a isclaiming efenant, while he is-. tinctly recognizes the rule, that the answer of one efenant cannot be rea in evience against another; an conclues by repeating the iea, which he ha been enforcing throughout: “I want no evience against Pleger, but what his answer gives me, an I take nothing from him but what he amits he has no right to hol as against John Angle.”
In both cases, however, the ecree for an against the complainants, respectively, operate for the protection of the efenants, respectively, whose interest was balance between the real litigating parties as woul be the complainant’s attitue in a bill of interpleaer.
We have have use this case of Green vs. Pleger by way of illustration, an have set it out. at large, not only because it is apposite, but also because Mr. Dahiel, in his work on Chancery Pleaing an Practice, (Vol. 2,p. 982,) has, upon the single founation of this case, built what he seems to consier an exception to the general rule, an has expresse his iea of it in terms so vague an general as to be calculate to mislea, as well by those means as by giving to the case more prominence an importance than it eserves. The passage in his work to which we allue is this: “In cases, however, where the rights of the plaintiff, as against one efenant, are only prevente from being-complete by some question between the plaintiff an a secon efenant, it seems that the plaintiff is permitte to rea the answer of such secon efenant for the purpose of completing his claim against the first;” an it was cite by this court as one of the authorities for amitting an exception to the general rule in the case of Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe et al. (7 Eng. R. 561:) the other authorities cite being Fiel vs. Hollan, Osborne vs. The Bank of the U. States, an Morse vs. Royal, 12 Ves. R. 355; which latter was a case where Green, a part of whose answer was receive as evience, was a efenant in the ouble capacity of executor of one ecease party, an as resiuary legatee of another, between the estates of which ecease parties there was a complication of interest; an Lor Erskine allowe so much of his answer to be rea, relating to his capacity of executor as was not in favor of his interest as a resiuary legatee. An the same authorities ha been before cite in the case of Barraque & wife vs. Siter, Price & Co., 4 Eng. R. 545, where it was sai that the rule of exclusion i not apply to cases where the efenant claims through him, whose answer is offere in evience. But holing, as we must now o, after a more careful an thorough examination of the question, in which we have closely scrutinize these authorities, that the answer of one efenant cannot be rea in evience against his co-efenant, unless he refers to such answer as correct, or is so connecte with the answering party as to be boun, uner the orinary rules of law, by his confessions, eclarations or amissions, it is proper for us to remark that the octrine of those cases upon this point must be so moifie as to conform to the views now expresse.
In reference to that exception to the general rule of evience, that the amissions of one person cannot be given in evience against another, which is foune upon an arises out of the connection of interest between the person making the amission an him against whom it is offere — -as that of joint ownership or liability, or that of the erivation of title of one several owner from another — there is this essential ifference between a joint interest an a erivative interest, that is always of controling import upon a question of amissibility, that is to say, the joint interest to be affecte by the amission must be a subsisting, one, at the time the amission was mae; whereas in the other case, the erivative interest to be affecte by the amission was mae. must have been acquire after the amission was mae. Whether the party making the amission an the party against whom it is offere, be connecte by a joint ownership or liability, or by the transmission of a several title, from the former to the latter, the interest of the party making the amission must be a subsisting one at the time of the amission. If at the time of making it he has parte with his interest, his amissions are not legal evience against him to whom it has passe. Upon this point the authorities are clear an numerous, an without exception or qualification in the application of the rule to venors an assignors. Inee the Supreme Court of New York, in the cases of Beach vs. Wise, 1 Hill’s R. 612, an Starke vs. Boswell, 6 Hill R. 495, have gone beyon this, an hel that the amission of a former owner of personal property, or of a chose in action, even if mae before he parte with his title, are not evience against his venee. This woul, seem, however, to be an invasion upon establishe principles of evience.
Applying these principles to the answer of Moses Ferguson, it is entirely clear that it was not amissible as evience against his co-efenant Blakeney.
The result is, thatthe complainants have no evience in the recor to prove their material allegation, that they are the wiow an heirs at law of Joseph Ferguson, .ecease, unerwhom they claim to erive title to the lan in controversy. Upon this groun then as well as that alreay consiere as to costs, this ecree must be reverse, an as the recor oes not furnish the materials upon which we can foun another ecree, which woul reach all the merits of this case, we shall orer the bill to be ismisse without prejuice to the rights of the complainants, an at their costs; that the appellant, Blakeney, may at once have the benefit of his writ of possession that has alreay been affirme to Mm by this court.",legal_case

elivere the opinion of the Court.
Louisa H. Allen, by her next frien, file her bill for a ivorce an for alimony against her husban, Abraham Allen; to which he file his answer enying the allegations therein, an set forth by way of cross bill, a complaint, in which he allege a breach of the marriage contract, on the part of the complainant, which she was calle upon to answer, an for a ecree in his favor.
For all substantial purposes the answer is a cross bill, an uner our practice in chancery, must be so consiere. It appears that at the instance of the complainant, the court ha orere the efenant to pay the next frien, for the temporary support of the complainant, a sum of money at state perios, which orer the efenant, for several grouns set forth in his motion, move the court to set asie; one of the reasons for setting asie the orer was, that the next frien was insolvent. The court refuse to vacate the orer, but orere that the next frien give security for costs on or before the secon ay of the next term of the court, or that the suit shoul be ismisse. At the next term of the court, the next frien file his written statement, in which he ecline to comply with the orer of court, an expresse a willingness that the suit shoul be ismisse. To this the efenant objecte an offere to waive the necessity for giving security in obeience to the orer of court. But the court isregare his objection an ismisse both the original an the cross bill, to which the efenant excepte an appeale to this court.
There can be no oubt uner the state of case, but that the court erre in ismissing the suit. The efenant i not move the court to ismiss the suit; nor i he consent that it shoul be one; an uner the circumstances ofthe case, even if the complainant ha formally move the court to o so, the statute expressly eclares that, after a cross bill is file, the complainant shall not, without the consent of the efenant, ismiss the suit. Dig. ch. 28, sec. 41. But in this case the suit was not ismisse at the instance of either party, but by orer of court. We will not say that a state of case might not arise, where, by the acts of the parties in the prosecution of a suit, or in failing or refusing to comply with the orers of the court, that the court might not orer the suit to be ismisse; but uner the state of casé here presente, we are satisfie that the court erre in ismissing the suit against the objection of the efenant.
The orer an ecision of the court ismissing the suit must be reverse an set asie, an the cause remane with instructions to reinstate the case upon the ocket, that the same may be hear upon its merits.",legal_case
1862733,Leach vs. Lambeth,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker
elivere the opinion of the Court.
This is an action of ebt brought by Lambeth against Leach an Simmons upon a writing obligatory, execute by them to the plaintiff.
The efenant, Simmons pleae infancy, an the other efenant, nil ebet, payment an set-off' Upon the first two pleas issue was taken: to the thir, the plaintiff emurre, upon the groun that there was not such mutual inebteness between the plaintiff an the efenant, set forth in the plea, as to constitute a vali set-off uner the statute; in this, that the contract sue upon was execute by Simmons an Leach, an that pleae in set-off was in favor of Leach alone. The Circuit Court sustaine the emurrer to the plea; an the correctness of its ecision upon this point, is the sole question presente for our consieration.
The statute, Set-off, sec. 1, Dig. page 937, provies: “ That when two or more persons are mutually inebte to each other, &c., an one of them commences an action against the other, one ebt may be set-off against the other, although they may be of a ifferent nature.” Being remeial this statute shoul be construe liberally, so as to accomplish the object intene by its enactment, which was, by setting off one ebt against another, to prevent cross actions, elay an unnecessary expense. The plaintiff contens that the term “mutually inebte,” means only such ebts, or emans as exist, an are ue from all of the plaintiffs to all of the efenants: an in suppoi’t of this position, refers to one of the earlier ecisions of this court, Trammell vs. Harrell, 4 Ark. Rep. 602. In that case, it is worthy of remark, that the sufficiency of the plea of set-off was not presente upon emurrer, nor was exception taken to the evience upon the trial of the issue forme upon it, nor oes it appear whether the question was irectly presente by assignment of errors, or argue by counsel. The court, however, proceee to consier the question, an hel that a ebt or eman, to be a set-off, must be ue from the sole plaintiff, or plaintiffs, to the sole efenant or efenants. The chief justice, issenting, hel that, although a eman, not ue from all of the plaintiffs to the efenant or efenants, coul not be pleae as a set-off, yet as regare’the inebteness of the plaintiffs to one or more of the efenants, the rule was ifferent; an that a ebt or eman, ue from the plaintiff or plaintiffs to any one, or all of the efenants, was a mutual subsisting inebteness within the spirit an meaning of the statute, an might be pleae as a set-off against the plaintiff’s eman.
This construction of the statute, in our opinion, is best calculate to give effect to it, an accors with the other acts, which make all contracts joint an several, whether so or not in terms, by which the plaintiff may, at his election, sue one or all of the fenants. Á payment by one efenant is, in effect, a payment by all. The efenants may plea separately, an any efence to the merits of the action enures to the benefit of all: an if the plaintiff is inebte to one of several efenants, an such efenant shoul choose to pay an ischarge the ebt of himself an his co-efenant out of it, it is, in effect, the payment an satisfaction of both, an no goo reason seems to exist why he shoul not be permitte to o so. Such efence in no wise affects the rights of the co-efenant, or of the plaintiff: not of the efenant, because so far from increasing his liability, it lessens it by ischarging a ebt, for the whole of which he was boun to the plaintiff; nor oes it prejuice the rights of the plaintiff, because, if in truth he owes the efenants or either of them, he shoul not, in goo conscience, be permitte to coerce payment from them, or one of them (which is in effect from both), without at the same time paying that which he owes them, an to compel this, an prevent litigation an unnecessary costs an elay, the statute of set-off was passe.
The rule lai own in Trammell vs. Harrell, although subsequently ahere to in Gray vs. Bagett, Fiel vs. Watkins an Wooruff vs. The State, seems never to have been fully acquiesce in: an in Sillivant & Thorn vs. Rearon, 5 Ark. 155, it was not only qualifie an explaine, but an express intimation was there given, that a more liberal construction of the statute shoul be aopte.
The question is again presente for our consieration, an uner circumstances which clearly show, that unless a more liberal construction is given to the statute than that in Trammell vs. Harrell, it will, in many instances, fail to accomplish the en for which it was enacte. In this case Simmons, one of the joint an several obligors, was a minor, pleae his minority an was ischarge. So that in fact, Leach, the other efenant, was the only legally boun efenant. It is true that the plaintiff sue him jointly with Simmons, but he was alone absolutely boun for the ebt. Leach pleae a subsisting ebt ue from the plaintiff to him, an there certainly can be no goo reason why he shoul not be permitte to o so. It is clearly a case within the spirit an intent of the statute, which is merely remeial an as a moification of the rule, as lai own in Trammell vs. Harrell, will in no. wise affect the title to property, but will at the same time give effect to the statute in accorance with its obvious intent, we feel less reluctant to o so, an to aopt that hel in the issenting opinion of the chief justice, which we think sustaine, as well by reason an a fair construction of the statute, as the ecisions of other courts. Thus in Kentucky, Dunn vs. West, 5 B. Mon. 367, one of several efenants was allowe to set-off his separate eman against the plaintiff, who sue upon a joint an several contract. An in Powell vs. Hoge, 8 B. Mon. 443, in a suit upon a joint bon against two efenants, the ecision in Dunn vs. West was approve. In commenting upon the statute an the effect of the plea, the court of appeals sai, “The plaintiff cannot be enjoine by the ischarge of his own liability. There is no other person jointly intereste with him in the ebt. An as it is a voluntary assumption of the payment of the whole ebt by one efenant, the other efenants jointly boun with him have no cause of complaint.” This is the view taken of the'question in the issenting opinion in Trammell vs. Harrell, in the correctness of which we fully concur. ,

elivere the opinion of the Court.
The action was ebt, upon jugment renere in another State. The allegation in the eclaration, setting out the jugment, is that the plaintiff, on &c., at a superior court, hel in the county of Talbot, in the State of Georgia, to wit, &c., by the consiera] tion an jugment of sai court, recovere against the efen' ant the sum of one hunre an twenty ollars, for her ebt, as also the further sum of twenty-one ollars an thirty-three cents for her amages, which she ha sustaine by reason of the etention of sai ebt, together with the further sum of ten ollars an fifty cents for her costs in an about sai suit in that behalf expene, whereof the efenant was convict prout patet per recorura, fyc,. The transcript prouce to the court below, upon the issue to the plea of nul tiel recor, shows that, in an action of assumpsit, before the superior court of Talbot county, Georgia, the efenant confesse jugment to the plaintiff for the sum of one hunre an twenty ollars, principal, with interest an costs of suit, an the plaintiff’s attorney signe jugment as follows: “Whereupon, it is consiere by the court that the plaintiff o recover of the efenant the sum of one hunre an twenty ollars, for its principal ebt, an the further sum of twenty-one ollars an thirty-three cents, for its interest, an the further sum of ten ollars an fifty cents, for costs of suit in this behalf expene,” &c. In the authentication of the jugment, the juge, who certifies to the attestation of the clerk, styles himself thus: “I, Alfre Iverson, Juge of the Superior Courts of the Chatahoochee circuit, in sai State, in which circuit is sai county of Talbot,” ec. The court below rejecte the transcript offere in evience, an gave jugment for the efenant.
We think there is no substantial variance between the jugment escribe in the eclaration an that isclose in the transcript. The original recovery, though informal, is, in effect, the same as that escribe by the pleaer in this suit. It is true the cases cite for the plaintiff, among which are, The State Bank vs. Gray, 7 Eng. 760. State Bank vs. Magness, 6 ib. 343, an The State Bank vs. Sherrill, ib. 334, cannot be sai to apply, because in those cases, the recital of the recor was only inucement to the main fact intene to be establishe by it, that is, the institution of a former suit upon the same cause of action, to rebut the presumption arising from lapse of time; an the case of Aams vs. The State for the use of Wallace, at July term, 1853, was ecie upon a like reason. But here the jugment sue upon is necessarily the founation of the action, an it must be concee that a misescription of it, in any material matter, woul be a fatal variance. Yet in such cases the pleaer is not require to escribe the recovery in haec verba, or accoring to its-tenor; but may set it out accoring to its legal effect. The rate of interest allowe by law, is the measure of amages for the breach of a contract to pay money, an whether the action be in form, assumpsit or ebt, the amages, in the shape of interest, follow as a legal consequence upon the ascertainment of the ebt. The jugment is correctly escribe, as to the parties, the' court by whom renere, its ates an amounts, an the eclaration woul therefore seem to be a compliance with the reason-for the rule of pleaing, that a contract must be accurately escribe in orer to ientify the cause of action, for the protection’ of the efenant an as a security against further litigation.
The cause of the rejection, not necessarily appearing, it may be possible that the Circuit Court exclue the transcript offere-in evience, upon the groun that it was not sufficiently authenticate; an so this court might have to hol, were it not for the ecision in Butler vs. Owen, 2 Eng. 369, that where a juge in his attestation, is escribe as juge of the court, it is a sufficient authentication uner the act of Congress, without saying.that he-is the juge, or sole juge; an we are not incline to epart from the preceent there establishe in any ease, where, as in the present instance, there is nothing on the face of the recor auce, from which it coul be inferre that the court was compose of more than one juge or-magistrate.

elivere the opinion of the Court,
It appears from the recor in this case that on the 14th of February, 1852, the clerk of the Hempstaa Probate Court, in vacation, grante letters of aministration to Jester Cornelius upon the estate of William Cornelius, ecease, an that after-wars, the last will an testament of the ecease was foun, an that it was amitte to probate, an allowe as such by the clerk in vacation, on the 12th of April. At the July term, 1852, of the Probate Court, the clerk prouce the will, together with the proofs taken before him in support of the same. Jester Cornelius, who was one of the executors name in the will, appeare an resiste the probate, filing various exceptions thereto. The exceptions being consiere, were overrule by the court, which proceee to ajuge that the probate of the will in question, as taken an mae before the clerk in vacation, be approve an confirme; that the letters of aministration grante to the contestant be revoke, an letters testamentary issue, or in lieu thereof, letters of aministration with the will annexe, in case the executors name shoul refuse to act. Jester Cornelius excepte to this ecision an appeale to the Circuit Court, which being of opinion that there was no error appearing in the jugement of the Probate Court, affirme the same; an from the ecision of the Circuit Court he has appeale to this court.
""Waiving the enquiry suggeste, whether any question was technically well reserve by the bill of exceptions taken by the appellant to the jugment of the Probate Court, an which the Circuit Court, uner the statute, woul have to etermine, in orer to ascertain whether the Probate Court ha erre in relation to any material question of law or fact, before proceeing to try the matter enovo; an allowing to the appellant the full benefit of every objection he may have esigne to make to the probate of the will, as it appears upon the recor, another enquiry, an one of more general concern presents itself; an that is, whether the appellant ha any right to be hear before the Probate Court, in opposition to the probate of the will, or any right to appeal from its ecision, whereby that coul be mae available as a moe of testing the valiity or invaliity of the suppose will.
While that portion of the statute of wills, which prescribes the requisites of a vali will, an the formalities attening its execution, once unerstoo an familiar to the mins of the people 'at large, ought to remain unchange, unless for some urgent reason ■of public policy, there are some other provisions relating to the proof an establishment of wills, ifficult to harmonize as a system, an which woul seem to nee a careful revision. The ■authors of the revise coe of 1839, in framing this title, eviently intene to aopt the leaing features of the New York Statute of 1836, while they have retaine some of the provisions of the Territorial Statute of wills, with such omissions an changes as they thought proper to make.
In the first place wills of realty an personalty are put on the ■same footing, an however proper this may be, an in accorance with the aministration law, making lans assets an, uner some circumstances, a primary fun in the hans of the aministrator for the payment of ebts, it might be ifficult to etermine, upon the whole statute, what effect is intene to be given to the probate of a will as evience, prima facie or conclusive, as a muniment of title, or upon creitors, legatees, or fieirs, who may, upon various contingencies, be intereste in the estate. It is mae the uty of the clerk in vacation, as well as cf the.Probate Coui’t, when informe of the existence of a will, to issue process to compel its prouction in orer that it may be probate. The clerk is require to take proof of any will, an grant a certificate of probate, or a certificate of rejection; a juicial function, falling so clearly within the principle ajuge in Kenney ex parte, 6 Eng. 598, holing that a master in chancery cannot issue a writ of injunction, an Scoggin vs. Taylor, 13 Ark. 380, that no power coul be conferre upon the same officer to issue a writ of ne exeat, that if these cases are ahere to, so much of the statute woul be unconstitutional, were it not for the further provision, that the act of the clerk, in pursuance of the power conferre on him by the statute, is “subject to the rejection of the court;” by which we unerstan it to be the uty of the Probate Court, in all cases, to confirm or set asie the proceeings ha before the clerk, whose authority is temporarily execute for the immeiate preservation of the estate, an who acts ministerially in certifying the evience, an preparing the subject matter for the ajuication of the court in term time.
The constitution inicates the court of probate as the proper forum, where provision shoul be mae by law, for the etermination of all controversies respecting the valiity of wills, with the right of appeal as in other cases. No goo reason is perceive why this shoul not be so : an in this country, where all courts are statutory, there is no founation for jealousy between common law an chancery or ecclesiastical jurisiction, nor is-there any substantial reason, in the suppose superiority of the lane interest, for excluing the salutary jurisiction of chancery, in cases proper for its interposition, by making the valiity of wills affecting real estate triable only at law. Yet the statute, Digest, Title, Wills, sec 32, et seq., contemplates an issue, upon-petition in the Circuit Court, to be trie by a jury, an treate as a common law proceeing, as the proper, if not the only conclusive moe available to any person intereste, for establishing or' rejecting any will, which ha been previously rejecte or establishe by the court of probate; while at the same time the proceeings before the Probate Court, as well as its clerk in vacation, appear to be summary an ex parte; nor i the original re-visors of the statutes make any provision for an appeal from the"" ecision of the Probate Court, in establishing or rejecting a will.It is true, by sec. 176, Title, Aministration, appeals are allowe1 from all orers revoking letters testamentary or of aministration, but that obviously relates to cases where the executor or aministrator may be remove for allege misconuct an the like,- an coul harly be construe to inclue a case like the present,, where the acciental circumstance exists, that the appellant having been appointe aministrator, as in cases of intestacy, was' necessarily supersee by the establishment of a will brought to-' the notice of the Probate Court.
But by an- amenatory statute, passe January 4th, 1849, it was enacte that, “appeals shall be grante from any final orer,jugment or ecree of the Probate Courts of this State, to the appropriate Circuit Courts, in the same manner as they are now' allowe in certain cases from the Probate Court.” Though very much in oubt, whether this act was intene to inclue ecisions of the Probate Court in amitting or rejecting a will, in cases where those classes of persons, whom the law woul presume to be aversely intereste, ha not been summone or notifie, an were not necessarily before the court, or boun by the ajuication, as a proceeing in rem, yet such an exception woul not be warrante by the explicit an comprehensive language use: an the conclusion is inevitable, that the appellant ha the right to appeal from the ecision of the Probate Court, establishing the will, an consequently the right to be hear there in opposition to it. Though possibly as the law now stans, this result might follow: that an unbien suitor in the Probate Court, woul be conclue by the ajuication, to which he ha chosen to make himself a party, shoul he afterwars attempt to assert the valiity or invaliity of the same will by an inepenent proceeing before the Circuit Court.
The appellant mae the objection in the Probate Court, an is entitle to have it consiere here, to so much of the testimony as appeare to be in response to leaing interrogatories put by the clerk, who took the proof of the will. The two subscribing witnesses appeare before the clerk, who cause their testimony to be reuce to writing, signe by them, an which he certifie in accorance with the statute. To one of those witnesses he propoune certain interrogatories, some of which are clearly leaing. However improper such a moe of examination may be, even when conucte by a isintereste officer, in the ischarge of his uty, an objectionable unless the leaing questions are explanatory, or allowe, in the iscretion of the court or officer, to be put to a reluctant witness, the objection mae here is not available to the appellant, because the testimony of the other witness, given in the form of a statement, an to whom the interrogatories o not appear to have been aresse, is full an conclusive as to all the points relie on to establish the will, an corroborative also of the witness, who respone to interrogatories.
It is also insiste for the appellant that the will is invali, because it was not signe in the testator’s presence; an numerous authorities are cite in support of what woul be a very plain proposition uner the statute of 29th of Charles II. The facts are, in this case, that after the testator mae his mark, the two attesting witnesses walke out into the gallery, or entry as one of them calls it; an signe their names as witnesses, an which, as they state, was one merely for convenience. It oes not appear whether the testator coul have seen them if he ha esire to o so. However esirable it might always be, when practicable, to have the attestation of a will complete by the signatures of the witnesses in the presence of the testator, it is not necessary to its valiity uner the statute of 1839, as hel in Rogers vs. Diamon, 13 Ark. 486. An as both of the witnesses appeare in person before the clerk, there is no place for the straine application of the inconsistent sections 19 an 20, of the statute, which seem to require that where a subscribing witness is unable to atten, or lives abroa, his eposition, if taken uner a commission, must state certain things, an among them that the eponent subscribe his name to the will as a witness, in the presence of the testator.
The ientity of the will prepare accoring to instructions given by the testator, the bona fie execution an attestation of it within the terms of the statute, are fully prove, unless it is to be hel invali, because of the remaining objection, which we now procee to consier. At the en of the will, the- subscription an attestation are as follows: “Signe in Hempstea county Arkansas, ate above written.
his
WM. j*j CORNELIUS, mark.
Signe in the presence of us, an we witness the same in the presence of each other ate first written.
J. H. NELSON,
E: W. MATHEWS.”
The proof is, that the will was prepare by one William Elk-ins, who, when it came to be execute, wrote the name of the testator, William Cornelius, at the en of the will for him, at his request, an the testator signe the same by making his mark, as appears on the face of the will. The language of the statute sec-. 4, is that every will “must be subscribe by the testator at the en of the will, or by some person for him, at his request.” The succeeing section 5, is as follows: “Every person, who shall sign the testator’s name to any will, by his irection-, shall- write his own name as a witness to such will, an state that he signe -the testator’s name at his request.” The first clause quote seems to have been retaine from the Territorial Statute, Steele & McCamp. Dig. Title, Winns, sec. 1, which require the will to-be signe by the testator, or by some other person in his presence an by his irection; while section 5 is taken.from the New York Statute, before referre to, which, without any express provision, that the testator’s name may be signe for him.-by another person, implies that in case of a will, as in other acts-, what is one by the irection of the testator is one by him, inasmuch as it provies, that “the witnesses to any will shall write opposite to their names, their respective places of resience; an every person, who shall sign the testator’s name to any will by his irection, shall write his own name as a witness to the will. Whoever shall neglect to comply with either of these provisions, shall forfeit fifty ollars,” &c. But such omission shall not affect the-valiity of any will-; nor shall any person, liable to the penalty aforesai, be exclue or incapacitate on that account, from testifying respecting the execution of such will.” The entire section quote explains itself; but the partial, an, we ha almost sai, inconsierate aoption of it in- our statute has a very ifferent effect: an there is no room to oubt, that where another person signs the testator’s name by his irection, the will is invali unless such person shall also write his own name as a witness: in other wors, the requirement of the statute, that the witness in such case shall also write his own name, is not merely irectory, to secure better evience of the ue execution of the will, but is a necessary ingreient of the attestation itself. Where this requirement is wanting, the paper not being holographic, might perhaps., uner certain circumstances, he establishe as a nuncupative will, but for all other purposes, it woul be an attempt at testamentary isposition, the same as a paper without any subscribing witness, though in fact execute an publishe, animo tcslani, in the presence of witnesses.
The enquiry, then, is whether this is a case within the meaning of the statute, where another person has signe the testator’s .name to the will by his irection; or whether the testator, by making his mark, i subscribe the will, so as to ispense with the attesting signature of the person by whom the testator’s name was written. An in view of the peculiar phraseology an context of the statute, requiring, as it oes, but two witnesses, making acknowlegment by the testator equivalent to subscription, ispensing with the ceremony of simultaneous attestation by both witnesses at the time of subscription or acknowlegment or a subscription by either witness in the presence, actual or constructive, of the testator, it must be concee that the intention, to be gathere from it, is oubtful. The argument, on the one han, is that the power of testamentary eparture from the usual an equitable course of escents an istributions, an which incites frau by its unavoiable association with unpaire jugment an enfeeble will of the testator, ought to be strictly pursue. An we are warne, by the successive eviations, tolerate an afterwars regrette by eminent juges, from the statute of Chas. 2, an which coul only have been allowe by construit4g the statute to mean, that it was not so much the will or paper itself that was to be atteste, but the act of the testator in executing an publishing it as his will, to ahere to what seems to be the policy inicate in the changes mae by our own statute.
It is clear, from the statute, that where the testator oes not bimself subscribe the will, the formal attestation of the person who signs his name for him is require. In this moe illiterate persons coul execute a will; an the ecision here must be in favor of the appellant if the statute thereby intene to exclue subscription by means of a mark, an to insure the ientity of the will by preserving evience of han writing, either that of the testator, or of the person who signe for him.
But we cannot tíonclue that such was the intention of the statute; an for the reasons following must hol this will to be sufficiently execute. It is to be presume that our statute was enacte with a knowlege of the statute of 29 of Car. 2, an the construction put upon it in Englan, an by the courts of this country upon similar statutes, as aopte in the several States. Uner that statute, which authorize the will to be signe by the evisor, or by some other person in his presence, an by his irection, it has been uniformly hel that a signature of the evisor by making his mark, is goo. An it was not so hel because that was the only moe in which ignorant persons, otherwise capable of evising, coul sign. There might be an obvious propriety in allowing a evisor, exhauste by sickness, to sign by a mark. In Baker vs. Denning, 8 Aol. & Ellis, 94, where the question was, for the first time, mae in Englan, whether a e visor, who coul write, might sign by his mark, from .choice, an without any apparent necessity for oing so, it was hel to be a sufficient signing, though with some hesitation. Mr. Justice Patterson, however, sai, “If it be once concee that a mark by way of signature, is a signing within the act, it is too much to say that in every particular case, we are to enquire minutely into the ability of the party to write his name. It woul be inconvenient to enter into such a question, an there is always the attestation: so that when a mark appears, there are means of enquiring into the circumstances; an the enquiry in such a case is, of course, more close than in orinary cases. But I am not prepare to say, that a man may not, at any time, sign by merely putting his mark, whether he can write his name or not.” So, the attestation by the mark or initials of a subscribing witness was hel goo in Harrison vs. Harrison, 8 Vesey J. 185. Ay vs Grix, i. 504. Notwithstaning what Lor Harwick sai in Grayson vs. Atkinson, 2 Vesey sen. 459, that the statute requiring the will to be signe unoubtely meant some evience to arise from han writing, there seems to be no ajuge case in Englan uner the statute, that a will may not be mae or atteste by persons, who o not write their names, an he was there speaking of signing in opposition to sealing. It is true that Mr. Justice Washington, in the case of Stevens vs. Vancleve, 4 Wash. Ct. Ct. 269, arising upon the New Jersey Statute, which require the will to be signe by the testator, omitting the wors, “or some other person in his presence an by his express irection,” argues in favor of a mark being a goo subscription by a testator; because the statute coul not have intene to eny the privilege of making a will, to those who from accient, isease or want of eucation, coul not write. An the argument may be goo for that purpose, without leaving it to be inferre that the testator must write his name in all cases, where he may be able to o sol The recent English statute of 1839, applying to real an personal estate, oes not iffer materially from that of 29 of Car. 2, an the interpretations put upon it, except in these particulars; that it must be signe by the testator at the foot or en, an that such signature, or the testator’s acknowlegment of it shall be mae before two or more witnesses present at the same time. Uner this statute also it has not been oubte that a signature by initials or mark of the testator woul be goo. In the goos of Savory, 6 Eng. Law. & Eq. 583. In re Fiel, 3 Curteis, 752. In re Bryce, 2 ib. 225.
Amitting the marke ifference between this feature of the New York Statute an our own, the one being irectory an the other imperative, still the cases in New York are authority upon the point involve; that is, when the testator’s name is written an he makes his mark — is that a subscription by him, or a signature for him by another person? Our statute eviently uses the wors, subscription an signing at the en as synonymous. In Chaffee vs. Baptist, Miss. Con. 10 Paige 89, Chancellor Walworth i not hesitate to say that the testator might subscribe by making his mark, an it was not necessary that he shoul be able to write his name, though the statute also recognize the moe of the testator’s name being subscribe for him by his irection. In Butler vs. Benson, 1 Barb. Sup. Ct. Rep. 533, the court, in giving a summary of their statute, say: “The testator must subscribe his name at the en of the will, which may be by his autograh, or by his mark, or if he is unable to write, by another in his presence an by his express irections.”
Our statute, which unertakes to remey some of the evils growing out of the ecisions uner the statute of Charles 2, by requiring subscription at the en of the will, an publication or some eclaration by the testator, at the time of subscription or acknowlegment, of his knowlege of the testamentary character of the instrument, an an attestation by witnesses at his request, as an equivalent for the security affore by their attestation in his presence, or accoring to the late English Statute, their simultaneous attestation, oes not in other respects iffer from it. It allows the testator to subscribe by another person for him at his request. There is no inication in it, that a testator, who from ignorance or physical inability is unable to write his name, or from choice, may not well subscribe by making his mark or his initials, which is vouche for by the attestation of the witnesses, sufficiently clear to change the rule of law as heretofore unerstoo. An we think we are giving full effect to the 5th section above quote, by holing that when the testator’s name is signe to a will by his irection, an he oes nothing more, thereby aopting such signature as his subscription, in such case the person, so signing for the testator, must also write his own name as a witness, an state that he signe the testator’s name at his request, an that it ought not to apply to a case where the testator oes himself sign though by making his mark.
An examination of the cases cite for the appellant, from the Pennsylvania reports, satisfies us that they can have no ecisive bearing upon this question. In that State the abuses an uncertainties of the construcción of their previous law’s concerning wills, inuce a change by act of 1833, requiring “that every will shall be in writing, an unless the person making the same shall be prevente by the extremity of his last sickness, shall be signe by him at the en thereof, or by some person in his presence an by his expiess irection; an in all cases, shall be prove by the oaths or affirmations of two or more competent witnesses, otherwise such will shall be of no effect.” The ecisions in Dunlop vs. Dunlop, 10 Watts, 153. Cavett's Appeal, 8 Watts & Serg. 21, an Gabrill vs. Barr, 5 Pa. State Rep. 441, to the effect that the testator must sign his name to the wii], unless prove by two witnesses that he was prevente from oing so by the extremity of his sickness, an that the mark of the testator will not suffice, the only substitute for his name, written by himself, being the writing of it by some person at his request, which must also.be prove by two witnesses, are in harmony with the statute. An in that State, where the witnesses are require by the statute to attest the execution of the will, but are not require to subscribe it, an never were, Stricker vs. Groves, 5 Wharton, 392, it is not surprising that the courts shoul efen the policy of the statute, by insisting upon the security of the better evience intene to be preserve by the autograph signature of the testator, in all cases where it woul have been possible to procure it.

elivere the opinion of the Court;
It appears from the recor before the court on this appeal from the jugment of the Pulaski Circuit Court in a proceeing by manamus, that at the December term, 1851, of that court, the relator, Whiteley, presente his petition setting forth, in substance, that pursuant to a joint resolution of the General Assembly, approve on the 12th ay of November, 1850, making it the uty of the Committee on Public Printing to receive proposals, an contract with the lowest bier, for the printing of the then present General Assembly, an such other public printing as the pub ¡ lie service mightrequire previous to the meeting of the next General Assembly, an to take bon to the State, with sufficient security, for the faithful performance of the contract, the proposals mae by the relator were accepte by the committee as the lowest bi, an he accoringly entere into the contract an gave the bon require; all of which, on the report of the committee, was approve by the General Assembly, on the 20th of November, 1850. The relator further represente, that in compliance with his contract, after printing the Acts of that General Assem-' bly, the account for which ha been pai an settle, he proceee to print one thousan copies of the journal of the Senate, an one thousan copies of the journal of the House of Representatives, the number of each require by law to be printe an eposite in the office of the Secretary of State: that he printe the Senate Journal from the copy furnishe him by the Secretary of the Senate, containing 452 pages of printe matter, the price for which, accoring to contract was $842 58; that along with the House Journal proper, he was also furnishe by the clerk of the House of Representatives, with copies of certain ocuments, consisting of the report of the Financial Receiver of the Bank of the State of Arkansas, incluing various tabular statements mae out by him, an forming a part of his report; also oí the report of the State Lan Agent, an that of the Superintenent of the Penitentiary, an a petition of the Attorney General, presente to the Legislature. The relator avers that in consequence of these ocuments having forme a part of those accompanying the Governor’s Message, at the opening of the session, or of their having been referre to appropriate committees an forming the basis of legislative action, they became a part of the journal of the House, necessary an proper to be printe, an the clerk whose uty it was to o so, furnishe him with copies of them, for the purpose of being printe with the journal, of which they constitute an integral part, an he accoringly printe them in the form of an Appenix: that the journal of the House, not incluing the appenix, containe 496 printe pages, the contract price for which was $932 60, an the cost of printing the matters containe in the Appenix, estimate accoring to the establishe rules among printers, with reference to the terms specifie in the contract, the size of the tables being reuce to correspon with the pages of the printe journal was $1,373 74, amounting together to the sum of $3,148 52. The relator further represente. that having eposite the requisite number of copies in the office of the Secretary of State, an presente an account of the items charge for the work, that officer accepte the journals as printe in ue time an in a workmanlike manner, an on the 13th ay of August, 1851, elivere his official certificate to the relator annexe to the account in question, certifying that the relator’s account for printing the journals amounte, accoring to his contract, to $3,148 52 in specie, an in script, estimating it at 90 cents to the ollar, to $3,498 35 ue for such printing. This certificate exhibite with the petition procees as follows:
“Mr. Whiteley having mae an error in his account for printing the Acts, of $1,279 27, amounting in script at 85 cents to the ollar, at which rate he was pai for printing the Acts, to the sum of $1,505, this latter amount must be eucte from his present account for printing the journals, leaving a balance ue to him of $1,993 35, for which sum the Auitor will raw a warrant on the Treasurer in favor of Mr. Whiteley.” The relator, after, averring the presentation of the account with the certificate of the Secretary of State annexe, to the Auitor of Public Accounts, an his refusal, upon request, to issue his warrant for the amount so certifie to be ue, an that there remaine in the Treasury an unexpene balance of money appropriate on the 11th of January, 1851, to pay for printing the Acts an Journals, more than sufficient to pay the same, praye for an alternative writ of manamus to the Auitor, that he issue his warrant, or show cause why he oes not o so.
The Auitor in his response to the alternative writ aware by the court, showe for cause why he i not obey it, that to issue the warrant in favor of Whiteley for the sum emane, being the balance of $1,993 35, as certifie to be ue him by the Secretary of State, woul be a gross wrong to the State, an a frau upon the public treasury, in his jugment; an he proceee to state the facts an reasons, upon which his refusal was preicate, to the following effect: That on the 20th of May, 1851, Whiteley ha presente to the responent, as Auitor, an account for printing the Acts of the General Assembly of 1850-51, an the reports-an tables appene thereto, certifie to be correct by D. B. Greer, Secretary of State, in which he charge for such printing, $3,584 20 in specie, an the Secretary of State, in his certificate to the Auitor, estimating the value of State script at 85 cents on the ollar, irecte responent to issue his warrant on the Treasurer in favor of Whiteley, for $4,216 70 in payment of the same: That this account being regularly certifie by the Secretary of State in accorance with the provisions of the first section of the appropriation act of January 11th, 1851, an responent presuming that the Secretary of State ha ischarge his uties faithfully an honestly, in the premises, an not then suspecting Whiteley of frauulent esigns upon the public treasury, treate the certificate of the Secretary of State as a sufficient voucher for the correctness of the account, to authorize him to issue a warrant on the Treasurer in Whiteley’s favor for the sum so certifie, without requiring further evience or making an investigation of its correctness. Some time afterwars, responent having cause to suspect that a frau ha been perpetrate upon the treasury, in the amount charge for printing the Acts, cause the accounttobe examine, an ascertaine that there were overcharges in the items composing the account amounting in the aggregate to $1,301 88 in specie, which having been pai to Whiteley in script, at 85 cents on the ollar, mae the over-payment amount to the sum of $1,531 62, of which Whiteley was notifie, an informe that it woul be eucte from his account for printing the journals. Having etecte the frau in the account of Whiteley for printing the Acts, the responent then eeme it his uty t.o cause to be examine various accounts previously presente by Whiteley for public printing uner his contract with the State, an for which the responent ha given him warrants on the Treasury, upon the certificates of the officers, whose uty it was to certify an examine such accounts, an which responent ha allowe on the faith of such certificates, he presuming proper vigilance an fielity on the part of the officers making them, an suspecting no frau; an on causing such examination to be mae, responent ascertaine that Whiteley ha been perpetrating a system of gross an flagrant fraus upon the Treasury, in making out his accounts for public printing. When the account in question certifie by the Secretary of State for printing the journals was presente to the responent, as Auitor, for his warrant, he objecte to the item of $1,373 64, charge for printing the Appenix to the House Journal, an to which various objections are enumerate in the response, the substance of them being that the journal require by the constitution to be kept an publishe by the House, is, in the jugment of responent, the aily recor of its proceeings mae up by its clerk, rea in the presence of, an approve by the House, an finally signe by the presiing officer, atteste by the clerk an eposite in the office of the Secretary of State; that the matters printe in the Appenix, were not part of the proceeings of the House, were not sprea upon the journal, were not orere by the House to constitute a part of the journal, or an appenix to it; nor was there any law, general or special, authorizing the printing of such ocuments as part of the journal: that all of the matters containe in the appenix, except the petition of the Attorney General, forme a part of the ocuments accompanying the Governor’s message, of which fifteen hunre copies ha been printe previous to the meeting of the General Assembly, an there was for that reason no propriety in republishing them: that if the clerk of the House furnishe Whiteley with copies of those ocuments, they were printe copies, not certifie by the clerk to-be part of the journal: that it was Whiteley’s uty as public printer, to certify the account of the clerk for copying the journal, an that Whiteley, in the ue performance of this uty, must have ha the means of iscriminating between the manuscript journal an extraneous matter. The responent then procees to surcharge an falsify certain previous accounts which ha been allowe an pai to the relator, upon the certificates of the Secretary of State, the Governor, an State Lan Agent, accoring as-the work ha been one for the ifferent Executive offices; an so of the clerk of the House, an Secretary of the Senate, specifying in etail the overcharges for work one, the false charges for work not one, an the ouble charges for the same work: the-result of which is, accoring to what woul be the responent’s moe of auiting the account, if allowe to o so, that after eucting all those overpayments an the error of $1,531 62 overpai Whiteley for printing the Acts, an isallowing the charge-in the account in controversy, for printing the appenix as part of the journals, the relator, instea of having a just claim against' the State for $1,993 35, accoring to the certificate of the Secretary of State, woul stan inebte to the State in the sum of’ $794 08 for overpayments upon the various accounts for printing one uner his contract, of which the responent furnishes a recapitulation. While the responent charges that these overpayments were procure by a series of frauulent acts on the part of Whiteley, he isclaims all imputation against the integrity of the several officers before referre to, whose uty it was by law, to examine an certify to the correctness of his accounts. Though submitting to the court the moe, accoring to which, in his opinion, the account between the relator an the State ought to be state an auite, the principle contene for by the responent is, that the court has no power to control his jugment an ecicision, as Auitor, in matters involving the consieration of issuable facts, upon which it is mae his province to exercise a iscretion by the uties of his office an the law of the lan. He represents that Whiteley has left the State, an that he an his securities are insolvent: an even if solvent, it is oubtful, as he is avise, whether an action woul lie against the securities for such overpayments; thus raising the question whether he, acting for the State, to whom Whiteley is shown to be inebte, ought not to be permitte to retain, by way of set-off, such amount in controversy, as is amitte to be justly ue him for printing the journals.
The relator emurre to this response, assigning various causes, all of which necessarily amitting the transactions narrate by him, resolve themselves into a enial of the principle contene for by the Auitor, an the basis upon which the entire response rests, namely, that by law an the uties of his office, he has a iscretion, an which the courts cannot control by manamus, to go behin the settlements of the present an all previous accounts of the public printer, an re-open an' investigate them, though examine an certifie to be correct by the proper officers, appointe by law for that purpose. An all that part of the response, setting forth the facts an reasons why the Auitor has authority to isregar the certificate of the Secretary of State, vouching for the correctness of the account for printing the appenix to the journal, is emurre to upon the further groun that while it asserts that the matters printe in the appenix, were not, properly, any part of the journal, it oes not eny that they were furnishe to the relator to be printe as such by the cleric of the House, whose uty it was to o so, an to whose irections in that respect the public printer ha to conform.
The response being ajuge insufficient, an no further showing being mae, the court below ajuge that a peremptory manamus issue, an thereupon grante the prayer of the responent for an appeal, an mae an orer that such appeal shoul operate as a stay of proceeings until the etermination in the Supreme Court.
It is esirable to waive any enquiry whether it be the intention or the policy of the statute, Digest, Title, Manamus, secs. 10 an 11, to make the allowance of writs of error or appeals from the ecisions of the Circuit Courts on writs of manamus, operating after notice as a stay of proceeings, pening the appeal or writ of error, emanable of right an issuing as a matter of course, or whether they are only to be allowe in the iscretion of the appellate court, or whether it is esigne to o away with all istinction as to appellate jurisiction, between those cases where the relator emurs to the sufficiency of the return as at the common law, an those cases, where, traversing it uner the statute, he elects to procee for amages with like effect as if he ha brought his action on the case for a false return; an to omit any notice of the refusal of the court below after the alternative writ was aware, to permit the cause to be ockete an procee in the name of the State npon the relation of Whiteley, because not examinable npon this appeal; an to isregar all exceptions to the response for informality.
In consiering the case upon its merits, it will be assume, as it is so amitte, that all the accounts certifie in favor of the relator, though by ifferent officers, stan upon the same footing of lawful authority in those officers to examine an certify to their correctness. The first section of the act of January 11th, 1851, making appropriation to pay for printing an istributing fhe Acts an Journals of the General Assembly, provies that, “All payments therefor shall be upon accounts certifie by the Secretary of State, which accounts so certifie, shall be sufficient vouchers for the Auitor.”
The law, to which no exception will be implie, Featherston vs. Aams, 5 Eng. 168, is that moneys appropriate are to be rawn from the Treasury upon the warrant of the Auitor of Public Accounts. That officer, Digest, Title Auitor an Treasurer, sec. 7, is mae the general accountant of the State, an require to keep all public accounts, books, vouchers, ocuments, an all papers relating to the contracts of the State an its ebts, revenue an fiscal affairs, not require by law to be place in some other office, or kept by some other person. He can exercise no juicial function, Auitor vs. Davies, 2 Ark. 494, but in the ajustment of claims against the State, he is empowere to take testimony or examine the parties, if he .thinks it necessary. By section 12 of the same general law, all persons having claims against the State, are require to. exhibit the same with the evience in support thereof to the Auitor, to be auite, settle an allowe, an this must be one within two years from the accrual of the claim. If allowe an there be a subsisting appropriation to pay the claim, the Auitor must give his warrant: if no money be appropriate, he is to grant to the claimant an official certificate of the amount allowe, which then awaits an appropriation. If the claimant be issatisfie with the ecision of the Auitor, he may require the Auitor to refer the same with his reasons to the General Assembly, or the claimant may bring suit against the State, the pi’ocess in such case b,eing serve upon the Auitor, an the statute contemplates that suits by or against the State, shall be consiere uner his irection. If the claimant succees in obtaining a juicial ascertainment of a eman in his favor, it is mae the uty of the Auitor to lay a copy of the jugment before the General Assembly, to the en, that an appropriation may be mae to satisfy it. Such, in comprehensive terms, are the stututory provisions on the subject.
It cannot be oubte that the Legislature has the power by law, to refer to her officers or agents, other than the Auitor, the settlement of accounts or claims against the State, an by whose ecision, within the scope of their authority, the State may agree to become boun. It might be well to ahere to the policy of making the Auitor the general accountant of the State, an preserving uner the supervision of one office, the'etails of whose uties become systematize, the eviences an ocuments relating to the public finances. But there may be exceptions to such a policy. If the General Assembly eems it expeient to place at the isposal of the Governor, as the hea of the Executive epartment, a contingent or secret service fun, the nature of the trust repose in him implies that the Auitor shoul issue his warrants, upon the requisition of the Governor, without question or hinrance. The same principle might be applicable to the moe of auiting the orinary contingent expenses of the juiciary; an with equal reason it woul be mae the imperative uty of the Auitor to issue his warrants for the pay an mileage of members, an contingent expenses of the two branches of the General Assembly, upon the certificate of such of their officers as might be appointe for that purpose. Because, though confience, no matter where repose, is liable to mistakes or wilful abuse, there is always some measure of responsibility attening such abuse, an it is of much greater consequence that the ignity an usefulness of each of the epartments of the government shoul not be impaire by conferring upon any one officer belonging to either a iscretion to withhol or elay the compensation of other public servants necessary for their subsistence.
""Where the Auitor, in the ischarge of his appropriate uties* has a iscretion in allowing or rejecting a claim against the State, an exercises it, his ecision cannot be controlle or reviewe by manamus. It appertains exclusively to the sovereign power to provie the moe an means bjr which the claims of public creitors are to be ascertaine an liquiate, an without the express consent of the State allowing herself to be sue, such a case is not one of juicial cognizance. Nor oes the submission of the State to an orinary suit at law for her allege inebteness, change, in this respect, the theory of a manamus* The assumption-of such a jurisiction over the accounting officers of the treasury-, woul not only isturb their regular business, but it woul have the effect of rawing inirectly to the courts, the irresponsible power an impossible uty of regulating the fiscal affairs of the'government.
But there is a marke istinction everywhere recognize between the exercise of iscretion an a ministerial act, the performance of which is a plain an positive uty enjoine by law, an when essential to the enjoyment or completion of some public or private right, an no other aequate specific remey is provie, the authorities concur in holing that a manamus will lie, afforing a prompt an efficient remey, at the instance of any person intereste, to compel its performance. If the Auitor shoul refuse to pass upon a claim presente to him, which the claimant esire to have one, so that if rejecte he might be enable either to bring suit against the State, or appeal to the General Assembly, we apprehen the jurisiction woul not be questione, to compel him by manamus to exercise his iscretion in eciing upon the claim; an so, if requeste by the claimant to refer the same with his reasons for rejecting it to the General Assembly. On the same principle, if the Auitor, after having allowe a claim, shoul refuse to issue his warrant, because in oubt whether the subject be embrace in the terms of any previous appropriation, the proper court, if calle upon to interpret the law, woul not hesitate to treat the issuance of the warrant in such case as a mere ministerial act of the Auitor, consequent upon his own ecision an involving no iscretion whatever. Byr vs. Conway, Auitor, 5 Ark. 436. Tully Ex parte, 4 ib. 220. Those cases go farther, in holing that the Auitor will be compelle, by manamus, not only to auit but to allow the salaries of public officers an agents, the amounts of which have been fixe by law an no legal excuse is shown for his refusal. See also Page vs. Harin, 8 B. Mon. 648. In Hawkins vs. the Governor, 1 Ark. 570, it was hel that a manamus coul not issue to the Governor, because being the chief executive of the State, a ue respect for his station forbae an attempt to hol him, in that moe, amenable for his acts to the juiciary. But no such consieration has been extene to the Auitor ; for though belonging to the executive epartment, his acts are not those of the chief executive, since accoring to our political organization, he is not appointe by, or responsible to the Governor.
It is a question of some ifficulty whether the submission 'of the State to be sue by her creitors, affors an aequate remey superseing the summary an specific one sought to be obtaine by manamus. The suit permitte against the State, is in the nature of an appeal from the averse ecision of the Auitor, an-must be an orinary suit in form, an in substance a irect proceeing against the State by name. It was not esigne to make the writ of manamus a substitute for the action of ebt or assumpsit, or a bill for an account. Here the specific relief aske for is the issuance of the Auitor’s warrant, the irect fruits of which may be to enable the relator to realize a mere money eman from the treasury: so that the ifficulty suggeste is forcibly presente. Our opinion is, that although the privilege of suing the State ought to influence the court in refusing to awar-the writ, in all cases where it may be oubtful whether the officer or inferior magistrate has a iscretion or acts ministerially, yet it oes not take away the remey where the istinction is clear, an the act to be one is purely ministerial, a uty enjoine by law, which the relator has a right to eman, though by the performance of it, the interests of the State may be remotely or consequentially affecte. Because upon principle, an unless this be so, the Auitor coul withhol the regular salary of any public officer; he coul efeat the execution of the laws, by refusing to obey the requisition of the Governor upon the contingent fun; an by isregaring the certificate of the proper officer of either House, he might force members of the General Assembly to bring suits against the State for their per iem an mileage.
It seems to be concee in the argument, that upon the facts set up in the petition, none of the material allegations of which are enie by the response, the relator has shown himself entitle to the writ. The responent sought to avoi the legal conelusion from those facts by going into an investigation of the series of accounts between the relator an the State'; an the question upon which the ecision of this cause turns, is not whether, if the facts asserte by the responent be true, the relator is legally or equitably entitle uner his contract, to receive any further pa3rments from the State, but it is whether the Auitor has the right to set up those facts in this proceeing. Although no reason is perceive why the accounts of the public printer shoul not have been referre for settlement to the office of the Auitor, as coming within the sphere of his appropriate uties, the Legislature thought proper to refer them to the Secretary of State or other officers. The accounts so certifie are mae sufficient vouchers for the Auitor, for the issuance of his warrants, to the en that payment may be mae. It is well settle that where an authority or iscretion is conferre upon an officer, whether the uties be in their nature executive or juicial, his ecision within the scope of his authority, though erroneous, is final an cannot be collaterally calle in question. The juge or officer, if the ecision has not been acte upon or passe beyon his control, may recall it if he believe it to be erroneous or mae in mistake. When the Auitor examines an accouht, referre by law to his office for settlement, an makes an awar in favor of the claimant, it is prima facie conclusive upon the State an all other public officers, because the government has agree to become boun by his ecision, he being responsible to the appointing power for any ereliction of uty. The same reasoning applies to an awar mae by the Secretary of State, or any other person selecte by the State as her agent for that purpose: nor will a court unertake to control the iscretion of one, any more than of the other. Because the Auitor is the general accountant, it oes not follow, as we have seen, that special authority may not be elegate to other officers or agents, to auit accounts against the State. Those exceptions to his general uties cover a large portion of the public expenitures. Unless the power of revision is given by law, he oes not erive it from the circumstance that a warrant must be issue by him. When the ecision of the proper officer is certifie to him, his act in issu-> ing the warrant is as purely ministerial as that of the Treasurer who pays it. Among the ajuge cases that might be cite in support of these views, it will be sufficient to refer to the elaborate one of Kenall vs. The Unite States, 12 Peters 524, where Stockton & Stokes, having ispute claims for extra services uner mail contracts, mae with a previous Postmaster General, which his successor refuse to amit, Congress at their instance passe an act by which the solicitor of the Treasury was empowere to settle an ajust their claims for extra services, an irecting the Postmaster General to creit them with whatever sum or sums of money, if any, the solicitor shoul ecree to be equitably ue them. Mr. Kenall being notifie of the awar, refuse to give creit for a part of the sum reporte to be ue to Stockton & Stokes, an upon their relation a peremptory manamus was grante to compel him to enter a creit on the books of the Postoffice Department for the whole amount. The Supreme Court, in maintaining the jurisiction to aminister the law for the protection of iniviual rights uner a constitutional government, use some remarkable language, reiterate in Decatur vs. Pauling, 4 Peters 516, not calle for in reference to the powers of the executive in this State, but establishing fully the principle laying at the founation of the present case, that, though to be cautiously ealt with, it must always be a juicial question, whether the particular act involves executive iscretion, or is a mere ministerial uty. The court ha no hesitation in eciing that uner that law the Postmaster General was veste with no iscretion or control over the ecisions of the solicitor, no appeal or review being provie by it: an that the entering of the creit was “a precise, efinite act, purely ministerial, an about which the Postmaster General has no iscretion whatever.” It can make no ifference that here the act of the General Assembly making the submission to the Secretary of State, was passe in avance of the claim for services to be renere ""by the relator uner his contract.
The strong position taken by the response is, that the relator having procure the settlement of the account in controversy an of previous accounts by frau or eception, practice upon the officers who certifie them, the court ought not to ai him in obtaining the relief he now seeks in this or any other proceeing. Upon examination this will be foun to be another phase of the same enquiry, whether the Auitor is estoppe by the ecision of the Secretary of State from urging the objection. The law mae it the uty of the Secretary of State to ajust an settle the accounts of the public printer. If the Auitor ha any implie power of revision, there must have been a corresponing uty resting upon him to exercise it; an then, accoring to his own showing, he woul appear to have been repeately erelict in suffering accounts to pass into warrants without any investigation, trusting, as he i, to the correctness of the certificates of the officers who examine them. No such uty evolve upon the Auitor; an the construction of the law which acquits him of imputation, must also prove that the responsibility of certifying these accounts reste upon other public agents, an with which he ha no concern. Here then the responent asserts that there was frau or mistake in a matter about which it was not his province to juge; while the certifícales of other agents, selecte by the State for the purpose of examining an settling the accounts assert, an supposing them all to be involve in thesame enquiry, woul continue to assert that they are correct as certifie, an free from frau or mistake. It is a plain proposition that the statement of the officer, having authority to bin the interests of the State, is to be receive in preference to the assertion of the one to whom no such authority has been elegate. This court, in the County of Ouachita vs. Saners, 5 Eng. 472, where a Circuit Court ha certifie a bill of costs in a criminal prosecution to the county court for payment, though some of the items of charge allowe by the Circuit Court were of rather an extraorinary character, sai: “So long as the orer allowing the claim an certifying it to the county court remains, it is obligatory an conclusive as to the amount of the costs an charges •to be allowe.” An so it ha been taken for grante in The County of Pulaski vs. Irvin, 4 Ark. 473. No oubt, it woul be proper for the Auitor, as a vigilant public servant, if he knew or suspecte an error in an account certifie to him, to refer it back to the certifying officer for correction or further enquiry before issuing his warrant: but he cannot overrule the ecision of that officer by persisting in a refusal to abie by it.
This conclusion, when arrive at, settles all other questions in the case really epenant upon it. As it regars the printing of the appenix, the probability is, from the references to the practice, mae by counsel on either sie, that ocuments have sometimes been inserte in the appenix, as often by accient or caprice of the clerks, as by the orer of either House; an one of the beneficial results of this controversy may be, to inuce the General Assembly to prescribe some efinite an uniform rule on the subject. But for all the purposes of the present enquiry, the account presente by the relator appears to be oubly fortifie, as to this item of charge, by the official sanction of the clerk of the House an the certificate of the Secretary of State.
The refusal of the Auitor to issue his warrant cannot be sustaine because of the right claime to retain the amount of allege previous overpayments to Whiteley. Inepenent of any objection to the re-opening of settle accounts, they all stan upon the same footing with the accountin controversy. If being regularly certifie they were proper vouchers to the Auitor, they continue to be so. We have no statute .authorizing the Auitor to retain, by way of set-off, a ebt ue from a creitor of the State.; an he coul only o so by way of euction in stating an settling an account, which he is authorize to auit. Of course, if Whiteley has not complie with his contract, it is to be presume that he an his securities are liable in an .action by the State for any breach of it: an that if overpayments have been mae to him by mistake, they may be recovere back. If the set-off is claime on the groun of their insolvency, the State occupying the position of any other suitor, who ha contracte improviently, it woul have to be etermine by juicial ascertainment. In a irect proceeing in chancery on behalf of the State, an injunction, if praye for against Whiteley, coul only be grante or perpetuate accoring to establishe rules of law an hv the ecision of a competent court. If the Auitor has the right, claime for him by virtue of his general powers an uties, of refusing to issue his warrant for payment of claims allowe by other officers, in whom ha been veste by special laws a iscretion to examine an ajust them, the converse of the proposition must also be true; an it woul follow, if his revising power be amite, that the Auitor, in all such cases, must have an uncontrolle iscretion of issuing his warrant in payment of claims which the proper accounting officer ha rejecte. In any view of the case, we conclue that the jugment ought to be affirme.",legal_case
1862659,"Hill, McLean & Co., vs. Rucker","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins,
elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of assumpsit by Hill, McLean & Co , against the appellee. The eclaration contains the common counts for goos sol an elivere, money pai, for interest an on account state. The only evience auce to sustain the action was the eposition of a witness, taken in New Orleans, who states, “that the account marke A, hereto annexe, showing a balance ue to Hill, McLean & Co., of five hunre an forty-seven ollars an fifty cents, by Emon P. Rucker is correct;” an he also annexe to his eposition the invoices marke B, an three hills of laing marke 1, 2 an 3. The same witness further state that it is customary for commission merchants to charge eight per cent, interest on open accounts. The ac count exhibite shows the total amount of ebits, as state by the witness, but there are no creits appearing, so as to make that amount a balance, or from which any recognition of the correctness of the account by the efenant coul be inferre. The exhibit B consists of bills of goos, some of which appear to have been consigne to A. Hays, Napoleon, for account of E. P. Ruck-er, Rucker’s Laning, Arkansas river; an another portion to J. A. McAlister & Co., Nashville, for account of E. P. Rucker. The copies exhibite of the bills of laing, show that certain goos were shippe by Hill, McLean & Co., at New Orleans, some of them on the Cotton Plant, marke “E. P. Rucker,” an consigne to Hays, at Napoleon, an another portion on the Harry Hill, marke “M. L. Rucker, Murphreesboro, Tennessee,” consigne to McAlister & Co., at Nashville. In the account, the items are charge uring the month of July 1847, the invoices are without ate, an the bills of laing are ate in November an December, 1847. The plaintiffs also prove, by another witness, that the efenant, Rucker, was a planter on the Arkansas river in the year 1847. This being all the evience in the case, the court instructe the jury, that they shoul fin for the efenant, unless the plaintiffs have proven either that the efenant orere the goos, or that he receive them, an that the shipment of the goos an taking bills of laing therefor, in the manner shown by the eposition referre to, is not sufficient evience of a receipt of them by the efenant, but there must be proof of an actual receipt of the goos by him, if they were not orere.
Such, in substance, was the instruction given, the propriety of which is not questione; but it appears that the court, in response to an- enquiry from the jury, tol them, that the eposition was evience, but not sufficient for them to fin a verict for the plaintiffs, who shoul have prove that the efenant ha either orere or receive the goos: an it is argue, for the appellants that such- charge, in- the terms given,, was- an invasion by the court below of the province of the jury.
Accoring to the settle practice in this State, the court has no power to orer a peremptory non-suit, Martin & Van Horne vs. Webb, 5 Ark. 72. Ringo vs. Fiel, 1 Eng. 48, but the practice has prevaile for the court, sitting as a jury, or the jury uner instructions from the court, to fin as in case of non-suit, which is a etermination of the case upon the merits as presente by the evience, a bar to any future action for the same cause, an to which error lies, Fagan vs. Faulkner, 5 Ark. 161. Cocke vs. Brogan, ib. 694. Palmer & Southmay vs. Ashley & Ringo, 3 ib. 75, though the correctness of it was oubte in Goorich vs. Fritz, 4 Ark. 525, an in Carr vs. Crain, 2 Eng. 249, repeate in The State use &c., vs. Roper, 3 ib. 493, the court sai, “ The correct motion is to instruct the jury that if the evience has not prove a matter necessary to be proven, they must fin for the efenant,” though in the two last cases mentione, the istinction oes not appear to be notice, that to orer a non-suit is to say the jury shall not pass on the evience, while the letter authority is that the court has not this power, an that the plaintiff has the right to have the jury pass on his case, an to be conclue if he will by the jugment, which being final entitles him to a revision in the appellate court. But to instruct the jury to fin as in, case of non-suit, is only the opinion of the court.that the plaintiff has faile to make out his case in evience, an so far from taking the case from the jury is every way favorable to the plaintiff, because it is analogous to a emurrer to evience, where all-legitimate presumptions of fact are to be inulge in favor of the evience.
There is therefore no real iscrepancy between the cases averte to, an they all ten to establish, that however angerous it may be for a efenant to ask the court to instruct the jury to' fin as in case of non-suit, or that the plaintiff has faile to make out his case in evience, it is no assumption of power for the court-to give such an instruction, the only question being whether it was properly given. In this case the real truth may be, that the efenant was resisting payment of a just eman, an that the apparent inconsistencies in the eposition coul have been reconcile an any efect of proof supplie by further testimony; but accoring to the case presente on the recor, the jury coul not-have been justifie by the evience in fining a verict for the plaintiffs, an consequently the expression of such an opinion by the court was erroneous. The statement of the witness who epose that the account exhibite showing a certain balance ue the plaintiffs from the efenant was correct, might have been honestly mae, as appearing to him from the books of the plaintiffs; but it cannot be stretche to mean that the witness was personally cognizant of the transactions about which he testifie, or to amount to proof that the efenant, not shown to have receive the goos, ha orere or bargaine for them, so as to be1come chargeable for their value by the elivery of them to a carrier.

1862661,Hynson vs. Noland,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins
elivere the opinion of the Court.
This was an action of assumpsit brought by the plaintiff against the efenant in error, for money ha an receive. It appears that, in the spring of 1849, the plaintiff, being appointe Receiver of Public Moneys for the Unite States, at the Bates-ville Lan Office, employe Aaron W. Lyon to transact the business, constituting him general agent for that purpose. It was especially expresse in the instrument, or power of attorney execute by Hynson to Lyon, that the latter was to have the entire controll of all moneys pai into the office, an was to isburse the same accoring to law, an in that instrument, the receipt, controll an management of all moneys accruing to the office were guarantie by Hynson to Lyon, as a means of securing him against all loss or amage on account of any efault of Hynson as Receiver, Lyon being one of the securities of Hynson on his official bon. By virtue of that appointment, Lyon attene to all the business of the office for Ilynson, an in his name as Receiver. Hynson was remove in April, 1850, when the efenant, Nolan, was appointe to the office in his stea. After that perio Lyon continue to o the uties evolving on Plynson as late Receiver, in closing up the business of the office an until it was turne over to the government. By request of Lyon the efenant, Nolan, inclue in tii '■ estimates lor his first raft to be receive from the government on account of expenses, &c., the sum of $107 58, being a balance ue lo Hynson as late Receiver, consisting of various items for money expene an a resiue of salary an percentages, of which a statement was renere. Nol an accoringly receive a raft, incluing what was ue Hynson, an on the 22 of July, 1.85.0, pai the amount over to Lyon, as agent for him. Lyon appropriate the money in part to pay the expenses inclue in his statement renere to No-lan; $63 00 he retaine for compensation ue to him by Hynson, when he went out of office, an for which sum Hynson ha given him a ue bill or memoranum, ate on the 15th of April, 1850, an expresse to be payable “on next raft,”- ap the resiue of it he applie as a creit on another note which he hel against Hynson. Nolan was aware that Lyon ha acte as agent for Hynson, an being such ha transacte all the business of the office for him, an pai over the money in question 'to him as agent, he proucing one of Hynson’s blank signatures, of which he hacontroll, an over which a receipt or voucher for it was written, Lyon aing to the signature the wors “late Receiver,” that being the style customary with the Department in corresponing with a former Receiver.
The plaintiff aske the court sitting as a jury to eclare it as law an governing thiá case, that the agency which he gave to Lyon to act for him was confine to the time that the plaintiff was in office as Receiver, an that if efenant pai the money ue the plaintiff to Lyon, without authority to o so, other than the general authority which Lyon ha to transact the business of the office for Hynson as Receiver, it was no efence to the action — which the court refuse to o, but on the contrary eclare its opinion of the law applicable to the case tobe, that so long as Lyon acte as Hynson’s agent, without any revocation of his agency, his acts as ^tgent were bining upon Hynson, an the payment of the money to him as such agent was a goo efence to Nolan. Upon that exception arises the only question of law reserve in the court below or argue here for theplaintiffin error.
Without regar to the subsequent motion of the plaintiff for new trial, the effect of which woul be to let in the consieration of any inequitable circumstances attening his claim an enable this court, though in oubt if the court below ha not erre in its opinion of the law, to affirm the jugment, if upon the whole recor it appeare to be right, it seems quite plain that the authority given to Lyon to act as agent, was in the nature of a power couple with an interest, it being for the protection of himself an the other securities of Hynson, an was consequently irrevocable so long as there remaine any money of the office to be isburse or accounte for to the government after Hynson’s removal. Though the securities might not have incurre any liability to the government in case Hynson himself ha receive the money in question, yet so far as Lyon was concerne, his right to receive an isburse all moneys accruing to the office, was the consieration for which he became security an unertook the agency. He,'as Hynson’s agent an after his removal, settle withHhe government an pai over to the successor, the public moneys for which the late receiver was accountable-, an upon the case mae in evience it woul be a narrow an technical construction of the agent’s authority to hol that it i not exten to the after formality of receiving from the government the arrearages ue to the principal, an out of which the agent was entitle to receive his compensation. An upon the precise question of law mae by the instruction it was correct as given, because if Hynson, after his removal, permitte Lyon to act as his agent in closing up the business of the office, Hynson, until a revocation of such authority, woul be boun by the acts -of his agent without reference to any previous appointment.
