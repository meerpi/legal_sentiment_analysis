1862633,Newton vs. The State Bank,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1848-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an action of ejectment, brought by Newton'against the Bank, for the recovery of certain lots of land in the city of Little Rock. Newton claimed title to the lots as a purchaser at sheriff’s sale, and at the trial of the case produced a record showing a judgment against the Bank, an execution duly returned, showing a regular levy on the lots, their advertisement and sale according to law, and also, the sheriff’s deed, duly acknowledged and recorded. The Bank (the defendant in execution) then offered to prove by parol evidence that the sale to the plaintiff was made without notice, on a day subsequent to that stated in the sheriff’s return; to the introduction of which the plaintiff objected, upon the grounddhat such evidence-was inadmissible to contradict the return of the sheriff, and the recitals in the deed in that particular. But the Circuit Court overruled the objection, and permitted such evidence to be given to the jury; to which the plaintiff excepted. And the admission of this evidence over the objection of the plaintiff, presents the only important question to be determined. The act of the Legislature, which requires the sheriff to recite the names of the parties, the date of the writ and of the judgment, together with a description of the time, place,, and manner of the sale; and which makes such recitals evidence of the facts so recited, was intended by the Legislature to supersede the necessity for producing the record, from which such recitals were made, as a matter of convenience, and to furnish evidence of the authority under which the officer acted, as well as the manner in which he had executed his authority in the deed itself. Not that the recitals should be conclusive evidence of the facts recited; for that would exclude all inquiry into the authority under which the sheriff acted; but that it should be legal, competent evidence, until falsified by evidence of a higher and more authentic character. The acts of an- officer done in obedience to the law, when required to be certified and returned, form a part of the records of the case in which they are had; Lawson v. Main, Ark. ; and being part of the records, the return, as well as the execution and the judgment, imports absolute verity, and is alike conclusive as the judgment, upon the rights of the parties to the record. It is upon this principle that this court, in the case of Jamison v. May, Eng. , held parol evidence inadmissible to contradict a sheriff’s return upon a writ of summons. And this decision of ours is fully sustained by numerous authorities, and adjudged cases, in several of which the question arose under circumstances strikingly similar to the case before us. Thus, in the case of Love & Williams v. Powell, Ala. ; in a suit to try title, where the plaintiff claimed under a sheriff’s deed, the court held parol evidence inadmissible to contradict the sheriff’s return, and in conclusion the court said, “ Our conviction is that the deed is conclusive and cannot be impeached on a collateral issue, except for fraud in the execution of the deed, when*the process under which the land was sold is supported by an existing unsatisfied judgment.” In the case of Jackson vs. Roberts, Wend. , the sheriff’s deed described the sale as having been made under execution in favor of Hill & Stubbins. The defendant sought to disprove the truth of this recital bypai’ol evidence. The court said, the question is “Can that part of the sheriff’s deed be contradicted by parol evidence, which sets forth the writ under which the sale was made ?” The court then refers to, and approves its former decisions in the cases of Jackson vs. Vandenhayden, , John. , and Jackson vs. Croy, John. R. , in which parol evidence was held inadmissible to contradict a sheriff’s deed, and after commenting upon the effects of a different rule, the court concluded its opinion with the following remarks : “We see no formidable mischief likely to result from the operation0of such a principle. A party who may be injured by the mistake of a sheriff can have relief by a summary application to the courts under whose authority the sheriff acts, or through the medium of a court of equity ; and it is much better that he should be confined to this mode of redress, than to render all titles derived under judicial sales doubtful, and subject to be defeated by allowing the written instruments, by which they are evidenced, to be attacked collaterally by parol evidence.” Chief Justice Sharkey says, in Minor vs. Select Men of Natchez, . S & Mar. . “The purchaser is not put upon enquiry as to the regularity of the judgment. In the official character of the sheriff and his general power derived from that character, purchasers have a guaranty that they will be protected in their title.” Savage Ch. J., in the case of Jackson vs. Caldwell, Cow. Rep. , said, “It may therefore be considered as settled law, that a bona fide purchaser at a sheriff’s sale acquires a valid title as against the defendant in the execution, unless it is not only voidable but absolutely void.” The case of Trigg vs. Lewis, Littell , lays down the general rule, and shows that it is peculiarly applicable to sheriff’s returns. The court says, “ It is a general rule that the acts of a ministerial officer, as far as the rights of the parties affected thereby are concerned, must be taken as true, when brought into contest collaterally, and can only be impeached by a direct proceeding, such as makes the officer a party. This rule is peculiarly applicable to returns of sheriffs on process. Hence this court decided in the case of Hornback vs. Smith, that the return of a sheriff on the writ of habere facias possessionem is conclusive. It is therefore clear that it was not competent for the defendant to aver and prove any thing against the return of the officer in this instance; such as the proof tendered by the replication, that the land was not in fact sold, and that the proceedings relative thereto were not real.” The decisions are directly in point, and may be considered as conclusively settling the questions; First, that the return of the sheriff must be considered and treated as part of the records in the case; and secondly, that parol evidence is inadmissible to contradict it. The door for re-investigation is closed upon the parties to the record. It is not to be questioned by them; and this because they are parties to the record, and have day in court; and it is not only their interest but their duty to look to the regularity of the proceedings, and when passed without objection they may be said in effect, to have received the approval of the parties. And so with regard to the execution of final process. It is executed for their benefit by the officer of the law, and during the whole time up to the sale and acknowledgment of the deed, they have day in court, and it is their duty to see that the sale is conducted fairly; at least, if they should fail to do so, they have but little cause for complaint. The purchaser, a stranger, who had no agency in producing the irregularity, and no power to control or direct the action of the officer in any respect, who has bought in good faith, and acquired a legal title, valid and regular upon the face of his deed, should be protected in that title against those parties to the record, who have stood by and-without objection, suffered him to pay the purchase money, the benefit of which they receive, and receive a deed, sanctioned and approved by the court without objection from,them. Under such circumstances, as between the purchaser and the parties to the record, it would be wrong to suffer them, in a collateral proceeding, to introduce parol evidence to contradict the record evidence of the purchaser’s title. This question has been substantially settled by the decision of this court in the case of The State Bank vs. Noland and others; decided at the last term of this court, where it is held that after the purchaser has acquired title by sheriff’s deed approved and ordered to be recorded, at no subsequent time, after the lapse of that term, shall his title be questioned for fraud, accident, or mistake, or for any irregularity in the proceedings, which must as of necessity (in most instances) arise out of one or other of these causes, upon motion, or in a proceeding at common law. But where the proceedings were such as, in the first instance, to vest in him a legal title to the estate therein conveyed, or, in the language of the court, when delivering its opinion in that case, “ When his legal title is perfect, and when the validity of the title itself is assailed for fraud, accident or mistake, arising out of the irregularity of the proceedings, or the acts of the parties, he has a right to be heard before a tribunal that can rightfully exercise jurisdiction in such matters, with power and process to bring all the parties in interest before it, to put them upon their consciences to answer; to cancel the deed; to restore possession ; and to award equitable compensation.” How far, or under what circumstances the return of the sheriff and the recitals in the deed may be questioned in a direct proceeding in chancery, for that purpose, or where fraud is alleged in the execution of the deed, we are not now called upon to decide; because, in the case before us, no offer was made to introduce evidence to prove fraud. It is true that proof that the sale was made after the day fixed by law, and without notice, might, when taken in connection with other evidence, conduce to prove fraud. And if the defendant had proposed this in connection with other evidence, for that purpose, the question would have arisen as to its admissibility in a common law court- upon a collateral issue. But the avowed object of the defendant was to falsify and disprove the return of the sheriff, as to the time of the sale and the notice given. This, we have said, could not be done. And upon examination of the authorities cited by counsel, in which parol evidence was admitted to disprove the return of the officer, it will be found that in Tennessee such evidence was allowed to prove a want of notice, because the statute of that State declared the sale void, without notice. And so also in Kentucky, as to the quantity of land to be sold. The statute forbid the sale of more land than would pay the debt. This was a violation of a prohibitory, not a directory statute. In the case in Blackf. , the strongest, case referred to by counsel, the evidence was admitted to prove a fraud. And none of them are applicable to the state of case before us. , The counsel has, in an ingenious argument, endeavored to bring them to bear upon this case, by assuming that if the sale should be proven to be on a day subsequent to the first day of the return term, it would be void, because the execution was not then in force, and conferred no power on the sheriff to sell, and that parol evidence was admissible to prove the sale void, as held in Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana. This ground- was, we apprehend, taken under a misapprehension of the statute. It is true that the statute directs the sale to be made on the first day of the return term, but makes the writ returnablé on the second day of the term, Dig. Ch. , sec. ; andthis, as appears from the defendant’s own evidence, was theday on which the sale was in fact made, although returned by the sheriff as made on the first day of the term. A sale made on the return day of the writ is valid. Blaisdall vs. Sheife, New. , . Tayloe vs. Gaskins, Dev. . The sale then was not void for want of power in the sheriff to sell, and as regards the irregularity in selling on a day different from that directing sheriff’s sales and without notice, these are irregularities which arise in the exercise of power conferred. A departure by the officer from the statutory directions, as to the manner of executing his power, does not affect the title of a bona fide purchaser at sheriff’s sale. This has been so repeatedly decided by this court that it may now be held as settled law. Adamson et al. vs. Cummins ad. Eng. . Byers & McDonald, vs. Fowler,et al. Eng. . Whiting & Slark, vs. Beebe, et al. Eng. . But even if a doubt could arise as to the correctness of these decisions in ordinary cases, it is very questionable whether this case would come under the rule as laid down by the authorities most favorable to the defendant’s case; for the statute in regard to sales made after the property has been regularly advertised and bid off, and where the purchaser refuses to pay the sum bid, directs a re-sale, but is silent both as to the time and manner of sale. No doubt the officer may, on the same day, re-offer the property for sale, and then there would be no necessity for notice, but suppose, as is no doubt the case in most instances, in counties where there is much litigation, that the sheriff should not find time after selling, to hunt up the purchaser and make his settlement with him, or upon a refusal of the purchaser to pay the sum bid, to re-sell the property at once. It is evident that in many instances a large number of sales would be postponed by sham bids, procured to be made by irresponsible bidders, and if the sheriff is not allowed to sell the property on another day, it would result in incalculable delay and mischief. When, however, he comes to fix the day, the law is silent both as to time, place and notice. Should he refer to the statute he could derive no aid from it as a precedent, for it was certainly not intended to wait until the first day of the next succeeding term ; nor as regards notice, that thirty days should be allowed ; but on the contrary of this the statute is silent, and by its other provisions seems to contemplate a summary sale, by which, however, the defendant and the plaintiff are both protected against ultimate loss, by holding the first bidder responsible over for any loss which may arise, in case the property should not sell for as much at the second as it did at the first sale. Thus the first purchaser is made to stand between the defendant and loss occasioned by his refusal to pay the price for which the property sold at the appointed time by law and upon regular notice. In the case under consideration the defendant, by her attorney, was the first bidder, to whom the property was struck off, at a sale admitted to be in all respects regular. Upon a refusal of the attorney to pay the sum bid, the property, as appears by the sheriff’s return, was thereupon at once re-sóld, and as the defendant contends, it was sold the next day after. The second sale then was the result of the act of the defendant, who became, under the statute, responsible for any loss that might accrue by reason of the second sale. If loss, then had accrued, it would have been his own fault, and upon his own responsibility. Bnt in truth no loss in this instance accrued; for the property sold for as much at the second, as it did at the first sale, and consequently no injury resulted from the second sale. If the officer, uninfluenced by the conduct of the purchaser, had abused his official power to the prejudice of the rights of the Bank, he is responsible to her for damages, or if, by the combined action of the officer and the purchaser a fraud has been perpetrated to the inj ury of the Bank, she must apply to a court competent to afford relief; but in a common law court the validity of a sheriff’s deed cannot be questioned by parol evidence touching irregularities, not affecting the power and authority in the officer to sell and execute such deed. There is no doubt but that the Circuit Court erred in permitting parol evidence to be given to the jury to contradict the return of the sheriff and the recitals in the deed. And for this error the judgment of the Pulaski Circuit Court must be set aside and reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings to be had according to law, and not inconsistent with this opinion.

1862697,"Adams et al, vs. The State, use of Wallace","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Hon. Edward Cross, Special Judge. This case, it seems, has been twice before this court heretofore; and now two questions only are presented by the record, which it will be material to notice. The first relates to the introduction of the original record of the judgment in evidence, under the plea of nul tiel record. The objection, however, is not seriously urged, and is considered untenable, as the record corresponds in every respect with the allegations of the declaration. The second is, that the court below erred in permitting afi.fa. to be read in evidence on the trial of an issue, that there was no such writ as that described and set forth in the declaration. Thefi. fa. as described in the declaration, was sued out against Laban C. Howell, and William Moore, commanding the sheriff, that of the goods and chattels of Laban C. Howell, and William Moore, he cause to be made “as well a certain debt of six hundred and fifty-eight dollars and thirty-six cents, as the further sum of sixty-seven dollai’s and fifty cents damages, together with all costs of suitthat read in evidence commands the sheriff, that of the goods, &c., of Laban C. Howell, and ""William Moore, he cause to be made the sum of seven hundred and twenty-five dollars and eighty-six cents, debt and damages, together with the sum of nine dollars and thirty cents costs.” The recital of the writ of Ji. fa. in the declaration was matter of inducement, and that permitted to be read in evidence was, in substance, the same as that described in the declaration. The case of Rector vs. Taylor, Gardiner & Co., decided at the July Term, , of this court; Webb vs. Jones & Prescott, Ark. , State Bank vs. Magness et al. Eng. Rep. , State Bank vs. Arnold et al, ib. , sustain this view, we think, fully. The judgment of the court below must be affirmed with costs.

1862729,Turner et al. vs. Huggins,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an action on the case for deceit in the sale of a mare. The cause was before this court at July term, , reported in Eng. . On the trial had after the remanding of the cause, the plaintiff had judgment for damages, found by the jury. The defendants moved for a new trial, which was refused, and they excepted, setting out the evidence and the instructions given. The facts of the case appear to be that the defendants being indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $, for a tract of land he had sold them, he agreed to receive payment in property, to be appraised at its cash value. The property consisted of a wagon, valued by the appraisers selected, at $, and the mare in question, valued at $, which the plaintiff received of the defendants in payment of their debt to him. This was in April, ; soon afterwards, the plaintiff discovered that the animal’s eyes were defective, and in the summer following, she w as totally blind, and of little or no value. The plaintiff offered to return her before suit. As usual, in cases of this description, there was a cloud of witnesses, and much conflicting testimony. But wherever there is any testimony to uphold a verdict, we must consider as facts, so much of the evidence as does uphold it. All the parties, and several of the witnesses were present at the time of the sale. It is not positively proven that the mare’s eyes were defective at that time, and the weight of testimony seems to be the other way: the defect, if it existed, appears to have escaped the observation of the witnesses, none of whom examined her eyes. Nor is it clear that the defendants knew of the defect, and purposely concealed it with the view of practicing a fraud on the plaintiff; but there is evidence of the declarations of the defendants conducing to show that they did know it. One Joseph Turner was admitted as a witness for the defendants, and his testimony appears to have been received without objection, no doubt under a mistaken view of the former decision of this court. It was there held that he swearing he had no interest in the event of the suit, it was competent for him to prove that he, and not the defendants made the sale to the plaintiff, and for the error in excluding the proof of that fact proposed to be made by him, the first judgment in the plaintiff’s favor was reversed. This witness, on the second trial, stated that the mare belonged to him, and never did belong to the defendants: that he bargained with the defendants for part of the land they had bought of the plaintiff, and agreed with them to pay $ of their debt to the plaintiff, and accordingly brought his mare to the place appointed, to be valued, and at that time the mare’s eyes were sound, as far as he knew. It appears from evidence of declarations made by the defendants and Joseph Turner, that he was liable to the defendants for the costs of the suit, and the damages that might be recovered against him, and that they had not conveyed him his part of the land, and did not intend to do so, unless he paid the judgment, in case it went against them. The testimony of this witness, in effect, is not inconsistent with the other testimony that he, for a consideration as between him and the defendants, furnished them with the mare to pay in part their debt to the plaintiff, and it is difficult to perceive why he was not interested, and altogether incompetent. His credibility, however, was the only question before the jury, so far as his testimony is concerned; and according as the jury believed the witnesses, we cannot say they were not justified in concluding that the parties in this transaction practiced a cheat on the plaintiff, by means of a secret defect known to themselves, but not apparent on inspection! Only two points are made in argument for the appellant; and both of these are covered by the instructions given by the court, and are responded to by the jury. The first is, that the plaintiff’s declaration alleges that the defendants sold him the mare in consideration of a hundred dollars lawful money, and the proof is, that the debt of the defendants was payable in property; and that for this variance between the allegation and the proof, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. Without going into the distinction, not clearly defined in the books, between actions upon contract where the statement of the special contract is matter of description, material to be proved as stated, and actions for tort, arising out of contract, where the statement of the contract is matter of substance, only and by way of inducement to the particular grievance complained of, it is a sufficient answer, that there was also evidence that this debt was due in money, although the plaintiff was willing it should be discharged in property at its cash value, and on this point the court charged the jury, on the motion of the defendants, that if they believed the mare was delivered to the plaintiff in part payment of a pre-existing property debt, it would not be sufficient to satisfy the allegation in the declaration, that the consideration paid by the plaintiff was one hundred dollars lawful money. It is also argued that the court below ought to have granted a new trial, because the proof fails to show that the defendants fraudulently concealed the defect in the eyes of the animal. This, as a question of fact, was peculiarly within the province of the jury, and if they had found it for the defendants, the court might well acquiesce in their verdict. The defendants had the full benefit of the instruction asked for them, and which the court gave in charge to the jury; that in order to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict it must appear; first, that the defendants sold the mare; second, that they sold her for the consideration laid in the declaration ; third, that the mare was unsound, that such unsoundness was known to the defendants, and that they concealed the fact from the plaintiff, or failed to make it known to him. So, in the instructions given on the plaintiff’s motion, the court put the enquiry to the jury, whether the defect in the mare’s eyes was known to the defendants, and whether it was of such a nature that the plaintiff could not discover it by ordinary inspection. Certainly it is the doctrine of the common law, subject to some exceptions, which have no application to this case, that in the sale of a chattel for a sound price, there is no implied warranty of a sound article. The immorality of this rule is counterbalanced by the tendency to vexatious litigation, which would be encouraged by the opposite rule of the civil law. The common law requires vigilance and prudence on the part of the purchaser, and he may protect himself by requiring an express warranty of soundness. Yet the common law requires good faith and fair dealing between the parties to a contract; and it is well settled that the sale of a chattel may be avoided for a fraudulent concealment of a defect known to the vendor, and not discoverable on ordinary inspection by the vendee. The vendor is not bound to disclose defects which are open to the observation of both parties, but if he conceal such as are not thus visible, and which rest exclusively within his own knowledge, it is a deceit for which the vendee may disaffirm the contract and recover damages commensurate with his injury. The common law is free from the reproach which a contrary doctrine would impute to it. In Dillard’s ad. vs. Moore, Eng. , the defence, that deceit had been practiced in the sale of a chattel alleged to be unsound, interposed to a suit to recover the purchase money was disallowed, because the defect, although known to the vendor, was patent and visible, and therefore presumed to have been known also by the vendee; but there is nothing in the opinion which favors the idea that what the law condemns as a fraud can be practiced without redress to the innocent or unoffending party, who exercised ordinary prudence and diligence in guarding against deception!

1862738,Bolinger vs. Fowler et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. This was a scire facias issued the 30th day of April , to revive a judgment, which, according to the recital of the writ, was rendered in the Pulaski Circuit Court, in favor of the plaintiff, against the defendant, on the 25th day of October, . The defendant, Lee, pleaded nul tiel record and payment upon which issues were joined. The defendant, Fowler, pleaded in abatement; first: that at the time of suing out the writ of scire facias, there was no such person in being as the plaintiff, Bolinger: second, that the scire facias was issued more than ten years after the rendition of the judgment, without any leave of the court being obtained for its issuance: third, that it was so issued without any previous motion in court, supported by affidavit that the judgment still remained unsatisfied. A demurrer being sustained to the plea in abatement, no further defence was interposed by Fowler. Upon the trial of the issue on the plea of nul tiel record interposed by the defendant, Lee, the court rejected the record offered in evidence by the plaintiff, to prove the recovery recited in the writ; and the record so offered is set out in the bill of exceptions taken by the plaintiff. The court below having rejected the evidence, we are bound to presume in favor of the correctness of its decision, until the plaintiff in error will show to this court the particular wherein the court below erred. We cannot know what record of the original recovery may have remained in the court below, except so far as the bill of exceptions has made it a part of the record sent here. The only evidence appearing in the bill of exceptions, is what purports to be the record entry of a judgment entered nunc pro tunc, as of a previous term in favor of Bolinger v. Fowler and Lee, as his security in appeal, but no other proceedings are shown, nor does it appear in what court, or at what time the judgment was rendered. Conceding every thing in favor of the jurisdiction of the court rendering the judgment sought to be revived, both as-to the subject matter and the parties, the omission to produce a record of a recovery corresponding in date with the judgment, as recited in the scire facias, amounted to such a variance as would authorize the court below to reject the evidenced Although if there be a judgment against two or more, no good reason can be perceived, why the plaintiff may not bring his action of debt, upon the judgment against any one of them separately, yet it seems the statutory proceeding to revive and continue the lien by scire facias, must be against all jointly, Greer vs. The State Bank, Eng. , unless one of the defendants be dead, Finn vs. Crabtree, Eng. . But being sued jointly, whether in any ordinary action, or by scire facias is immaterial, if the defence be such as necessarily enures to the benefit of both defendants. So that, when Lee had 'judgment in his favor, upon the plea of nul tiel record, both defendants must have been discharged from the action. The last two pleas of the defendant, Fowler, were demurrable according to Alexander vs. Steele, at January Term ; but the matter set up in his first plea was sufficient to abate the writ. See Chitty Plead. , and cases cited. Any objection to the plea because not sworn to, was only available on motion to strike out or disregard it. If the facts be well pleaded, the office of a demurrer, which admits them to be true, is to question their legal sufficiency. The judgment is affirmed.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862683,Meech vs. Fowler,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. The plaintiff in error has appealed from the judgment of the court below, dismissing his suit for the want of a sufficient bond for costs. The objections to the bond appear to be, that the day of the month of its date is left blank, and that it is given by a firm, signed by their firm name and style under seal. The suit was commenced on the 18th of September, , and the bond for costs has the following endoi’sement, signed by the clerk: “The above bond approved by me, September ,, and filed before writ issued.” On the hearing before the court of the issue upon the defendant’s motion to dismiss, the plaintiff produced the bond and endorsement referred to, and made part of the record, and the facts in evidence were, that the bond in question had been filed before the commencement of the suit, and approved by the clerk of the court as sufficient: that it had been signed, sealed, and delivered by J. H. Patterson, one of the firm of Byers & Patterson; that he was a resident of this State and responsible for the costs which might accrue in the suit in question; and that the plaintiff was a non-resident; The statute requires the non-resident plaintiff, about to commence a suit in any circuit court, to file in the office of the clerk, the obligation of some responsible person, being a resident of this State, for the payment of all costs which may accrue in such action'. The question here is not whether one partner can bind his co-partner, by an instrument under seal, so as to make the firm liable upon an obligation executed by one in their joint names, nor is there any question as to what authority or assent by the partner not signing will be sufficient to make such an obligation obligatory upon him. The bond was certainly executed by one of the firm, and as held in Day vs. Lafferty, Ark. , it is good against him. Whenever it is admitted, as decided in Ferguson vs. The State Bank, Eng. , that the plea of non est factum goes onlyto thepersonal dischargeof the party pleading it; andthatthe party, who executed the deed, continues liable, it follows that the statute in this case has been substantially complied with. Neither the defendant, nor any officer of the court, who may become interested in the bond for costs, has any right to insist that there shall be more than one security for costs, if he be a solvent and responsible person. The case stands as if there were two securities, and one of them for any cause not liable on the bond or irresponsible. The date, though prima facie evidence of the time of the execution is not necessary to the validity of a deed, which takes effect from the time of its delivery. If the Circuit Court thought the bond to be so informal or defective as likely to embarrass the defendant or the officers of the court, in the recovery upon it of their legal demands that would accrue in the progress of the suit, it might, according to its discretion, have ruled the plaintiff to furnish a bond free from any such objection, as it would, where there is a doubt of the continuing solvency of the security; but upon the facts stated here, the decision of the court absolutely dismissing the plaintiff’s suit is not, as we conceive, in accordance with strict law, or the reason of the statute. The. judgment will be reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions to proceed therein according to law, and not inconsistent with this opinion.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862720,Burton vs. Hynson et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the court; The bill of complaint of the appellant seeks to enjoin a judgment at law, obtained against him in the Independence Circuit Court, by the defendant, Hynson. The bill sets out a history of the proceedings at law, which are, in substance, as follows: That on the 19th of September, , Hynson commenced suit against the complainant on a writing obligatory, executed by him to Hynson, at Dec. Term. , he pleaded to the action; 1st. payment; 2d, that the plaintiff was indebted to him, in the sum of four thousand dollars, for a house and lot in the town of Bates-ville, sold and delivered to him, and for divers moneys lent and advanced, for merchandize sold, and for medical services rendered by him to the plaintiff; 3d, that after the writing obligatory had become due and payable, in pursuance of a mutual agreement between them, the defendant gave up to the plaintiff a house and lot then owned and possessed by the defendant, and which the plaintiff accepted in full satisfaction of the writing obligatory in question. Issues were formed upon the first two pleas, and the last one was adjudged bad on demurrer. .At Aug! term , the defendant pleaded, that since the commencement of the suit, the plaintiff had been declared a bankrupt, pursuant to the provisions of the act of Congress, whereby all his property and rights in action had become vested in his assignee, who alone had the right to recover the debt then in suit, for the benefit of the creditors of such bankrupt. To this plea the plaintiff replied, that, on the 1st September, , before he became bankrupt, and more than two months before the filing of his petition, he sold and delivered the writing obligatory in question, to James Pope and William Byers, for a valuable consideration, in good faith, and without any notice on their part, of his intention to become a bankrupt; and that the suit upon the writing obligatory had been brought, and was pending in his name for their use and benefit. Upon demurrer sustained to this replication, judgment went against the plaintiff, from which, he appealed to this court, by whose decision that judgment was reversed, and the cause remanded: that such further proceedings were had: that, at August term , the plaintiff obtained a rule against the defendant to file a bill of particulars of his set-off, and at February term, , the defendant applied for leave to file an amended plea of accord and satisfaction, but there being no answer to the replication to the plea puis darrien continuance, on the plaintiff’s motion, the court entered final judgment against the defendant for want of a plea, that the plaintiff recover his debt specified in the writing obligatory with damages and costs of suit. The complainant represents that when the plea puis darrien continuance was filed, the attorney whom he had originally retained, was not in attendance upon the court, and he reluctantly yielded to the advice of the attorneys, then conducting his defence, to interpose such plea, whereby, as it turned out, he lost the benefit of his other defences, such plea being held a'waiver of the previous pleas on file in the cause; whereas he alleges those pleas were true, and that he could then and yet establish the same by proof; and proceeds to claim the benefit of such defences, which are again set up in the bill. He represents that the alleged transfer of the writing obligatory, sued for at law, to Pope and Byers, was a mere pretence and without consideration. The bill prays for discovery, and for an account of the dealings between the complainant and Hynson, and that he and the other defendants be enjoined from having execution of the judgment at lawi The bill is not sworn to, and no injunction was ever granted. Hynson answered, denying all the material allegations in the bill; he exhibited the account current, in settlement of which the complainant had executed the writing obligatory in question! As to- the house and lot, he represented the facts to the effect that the complainant had bought the lot in the name of his son Philip, who gave his notes for the purchase money, and obtained a bond for title. That complainant went on to improve the lot; but that he, the defendant, in fact made the improvements and built the house referred to, and that with the exception of an inconsiderable sum paid by the complainant, he had advanced all the money to pay for the work and materials, and for which he produced the vouchers: that after a time, and with the consent of the complainant, he sold the house and lot, and of the proceeds a part was applied to the payment of the original purchase money of the lot, a part was received by Philip Burton, and the residue went to pay certain debts of the defendant, but the amount received by him was not more than sufficient to re-imburse -what he had expended upon the buildings, and the sale of the house and lot had no connection with the writing obligatory in question, and was not any payment or extinguishment of it. He answered that he had transferred the writing obligatory to. Pope and Byers in good faith, and in payment of certain debts which he owed them. The answer of Byers set out the transaction attending the transfer by Hynson of the complainant’s obligation to Pope and himself, and avers that it was absolute and bonafide in payment of debts which Hynson owed them. Walker, the administrator of Pope, answered, that he had no personal knowledge of the matters in controversy, but claimed the benefit of the judgment at law, upon his information that the writing obligatory sued upon had been transferred to his intestate and William Byers. The defendants, Byers and Hynson, insisted that the complainant was not entitled to relief in chancery, in respect of the matters set up in the bill, because he might have availed himself of the same matters in defence of the suit at law, and they relied on this objection by way of answer to the bill. The cause was heard upon the pleadings and depositions on file, and a final decree entered dismissing the bill. We are clearly of opinion that the complainant, upon the allegations contained in the bill, is not entitled to be relieved in chancery against the judgment at law. In the case of Hempstead and Conway vs. Watkins, Eng. , where this subject is much discussed, the principle decided is this: that wherever chancery anciently had jurisdiction, it is not ousted of it, because courts of law have assumed jurisdiction of any of those subjects, so as to afford relief in like cases ; and that in such cases the defendant is not bound to defend at law (as he would be when the defence is purely legal) but he may elect not to defend at law, suffer judgment there and then make his defence in a court of chancery, to be relieved against the judgment. We are not called upon now to question the correctness of that decision, or to enquire what results it would lead to, if the principle there asserted be carried out in all its consequences. But that case concedes and it is no where doubted, that if a defendant, sued at law, make defence there, though of an equitable character, if it be such as courts of law at this day take cognizance of, he is considered as electing to defend at law, is held to that election, and cannot afterwards seek relief in chancery in respeet of the same matters; unless indeed, he be prevented from making his defence by reason of some unavoidable accident, ignorance of fact, surprise or fraud, and then he is admitted to obtain relief in chancery, sometimes in the shape of a bill for new trial, without regard to whether the defence, of which he was so deprived without any fault or neglect of his, be of a legal or equitable character. Admitting therefore, that the plea of set-off comes within the case of Hempstead and Conway vs. Watkins, as being a defence of which courts of equity anciently had cognizance, the complainant, by pleading it at law, is precluded from availing himself of that defence in chancery, in order to be relieved against the judgment at law, and the case then goes farther, holding that if the defendant make any defence at law, he is bound to make his whole defence there; that is, every matter of defence of which he could have availed himself in a court of law. Neither could the complainant come into chancery upon the ground that the accord and satisfaction set up was not available to him at law. And this for several reasons. It is the same matter as that pleaded by way of set off, and relied on as, in effect, a payment. Whether the plea was well or ill pleaded, and whether the demurrer was properly sustained, we will not en-quire. Enough appears on the face of the plea and the allegations of the bill, to show that the alleged accord and satisfaction does not come within the decision in Levy vs. Very, Eng. , which is not to be extended beyond the point actually decided that at law an executory contract under seal,is notsatisfied by the acceptance of an executory promise not under seal, to perform the same debt or duty, even though the consideration be the present payment of part of the debt, and the shortening of the time, by the terms of the parol promise, for the payment of the residue. The defence here was an accord fully executed by the acceptance of property in satisfaction of a debt due. The complainant does not claim any right to relief in equity, because this defence was not cognizable at law, but claims to be relieved because he was deprived of the benefit of it by the effect of the plea puis darrien continuance. The law of the case, as to the complainant’s legal rights, is settled by the decisions of this court in Hynson vs. Burton, Ark. , and Burton vs. Hynson, Eng. . The excuse for coming into chancery is, that the complainant’s attorneys, who conducted his defence to the original suit at law in the Circuit Court, either through ignorance or design, managed the case unskilfully. There would be no end of litigation and no security in the due enforcement of contracts, if the solemn judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction could be set aside, or the successful party restrained from executing it, upon grounds which do not imply any fault in the party obtaining the judgment, nor any error of the court in rendering it. But in truth the allegations of the bill as to the absence of the counsel on whom the complainant relied, and the want of skill in those who conducted his defence to the suit at law, are wholly unsustained by proof. And so, although in our opinion, the bill was rightly dismissed at the hearing for want of jurisdiction, we think there would be no good reason, upon a careful examination of the testimony, to doubt the correctness of the decree upon the merits. The decree will be affirmed. Walker, J. not sitting.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862610,Fenno vs. Coulter,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court. George C. Watkins, as the assignee of Royster, obtained judgment against James'and Richard Coulter, and sued out execution thereon, which was levied on property of the defendant, but which, for want of time, was not sold. Without having disposed of this levy, the plaintiff sued out an alias ji.fa. which was levied, as appears by the return on the writ, on the west half of the south-west quarter of section twenty-eight, and the south-west quarter of section twenty-nine, all in township two north, range eleven west; which were appraised under the statute and offered for sale, but was not sold, because it failed to bring two-thirds of its appraised value. On the 2d of May, , and after the death of James Coulter, a writ of ven. ex., issued, describing the land directed to be sold, according to the return of the sheriff on the ji. fa. Under, and in obedience to this writ of ven. ex., the sheriff advertised and sold the land therein described, to Fenno, who was the highest bidder, for the price of $ ; which sum he paid: and thereupon the sheriff executed to Fenno’ a deed, not for the south-west quarter, sec. , as described in the levy and writ of ven. ex., but the south-east quarter of said section, which was the property of said Coulter. The complainant claims title as sole heir of Coulter, alleges that the sale was void, but that the deed being of record, tends to cast suspicion on her title, and prays that the deed may be cancelled and given up. It appears from the evidence that the sheriff knew where Coulter lived; but did not know the numbers of the land, and took them from his tax book without going upon the land, or taking any steps to ascertain the land, which in point of fact, belonged to Coulter. The numbers in the tax book, the return on the Ji. fa., the numbers in the ven, ex., and the advertisement, all described it as the south-west quarter. At the sale, the sheriff was informed that he had mistaken the numbers of the land, he replied that he had not time then to examine, but that he was selling the Coulter place. Fenno was present at the time, and must be presumed to have heard what was said. Fenno contends that in point of fact', the sheriff did levy on the Coulter land, but by mistake, returned a different tract as levied upon. This may, in some instances, be the case, as where the sheriff, after having ascertained and set apart the property of the defendant, by mistake, returns a different tract from that so ascertained; or he may have supposed certain lands tobe the property of the defendant, and returned them as levied upon. In the first instance there would be a levy on the property of the defendant, but a mistake in making the entry on his return. In the second, there would' be an intention to levy on the land of the defendant, but by mistake, a levy on' other lands, not the defendant’s. In the first the mistake would consist in the entry upon the writ; in the second, in having mistaken the property of a third person for that of the defendant. One of the first steps towards a levy is to ascertain andidentify the property of the defendant, so as to distinguish it from other property, and then to estimate in value, what will be sufficient to satisfy the execution. When this is done (where the property is land) the levy is complete, and may be entered on his writ. It is not indispensably necessary to the validity of a levy on land that the sheriff should actually go upon it. He cannot take it into possession. But he must distinguish it as the property of the defendant, and in the exercise of a sound discretion, set apart the property intended to be sold; he may then mistake in making his return of levy upon the writ, but until then, it is no mistake in recording his return, but a mistake as to the land that belonged to the defendant. There can be no mistake in doing what one intends to do. When we seek to ascertain the value of land we must usally go upon it and examine it. But when we seek to ascertain the ownership, we usually look to the record evidence of title : the land is there described most usually in the new States by numbers. We do not mean that it becomes the officer to trace out the title. The validity of the title is not a matter for him to enquire into. It is true that possession may, and frequently does aid in identifying real estate, but a mere possessory title is not subject to sale ; indeed, we do often all derive much benefit in ascertaining the ownership of land by mere possession. In order to convey land, it must be described by its true numbers, or other definite description. The sale does not take place upon the land : it is not exhibited to the purchaser for inspection; he buys it by its description, and takes his deed accordingly. If this was personal property, where possession is'the usual evidence of title, less certainty in description might be required, yet as far as the fact of an actual levy on the identical property of the defendant is concerned, the principle is the same. If a sheriff should levy on one of several horses, in the defendant’s possession, and that levied upon should prove not to be his property, although the sheriff believed, at the time of the levy, that he was levying upon the property of the defendant, and should return accordingly, it could not be said that he levied on the defendant’s property, because he thought it his at the time. The fact that personal property; when levied upon, may be taken into possession by the officer, which is not the case in regard to land, does not affect the question of levy. It is not essential in either case to the validity of the levy, that the property levied upon should be taken into possession. From all the circumstances of this case, we think there was no mistake in making an entry upon the writ of the property levied upon, but a mistake in levying upon the property of a third person as the defendant’s.. But even if wrong in this, the south-west quarter, which was not the property of Coulter, was described in the ven. ex., and the sheriff commanded to sell the land therein described. A ven. ex. confers no power upon the officer to levy .upon land, but simply to expose to sale the lands in the writ described. Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe et al. Eng. . If the sheriff should be permitted to transcend his authority and power, so far as to sell the south-east quarter, under a writ commanding him to sell the south-west quarter, where will be the limit to his power? Iiow many tracts may he sell ? The same rule which would authorize the sale of an adjoining tract, would justify a sale of one more distant, or any number as well as one. It may be said that the sheriff knew that there was a mistake in the entry of his return, and that the south-east quarter was that, which in fact, was levied upon. Concede it to be true that such was the fact, and the sheriff knew it, shall we say that the sheriff may abandon the command of his writ, and sell olher land, because he knew of his personal knowledge that they were the lands really intended to be sold? But put it on a still stronger ground in his favor, and say the levy on the fi. fa., was correct, and that the mistake was alone in the ven. ex., shall he be permitted to disregard the command of his writ, commanding him to expose certain-lands to sale, and expose other? We think not: and for a still stronger reason he could not, in legal effect, amend a sheriff’s return. This could only be done by leave of court; and .as Coulter died before the writ of ven. ex., issued, an amendment could not have been made, even by the court, until new parties were brought before it. Under this state of case, even admitting the first writ to have been levied, the sale under the ven. ex., of the south-east quarter, was void, for want of power in the officer to sell. But when taken in connection with the fact that there was no levy, no writ authorizing the sale, no advertisement of the property, and the whole proceeding had after a levy had been made, and which remained undischarged, it is rarely that a sale will be found so utterly destitute of authority in the officer to sell. There is no contest between the parties as to the other tract ""sold. The prayer of the complainant is, that the sheriff’s deed, under which Fenno claimed the land, may be canceled and set aside, so far as it purports, or is intended to convey title to the southeast quarter of section , and for general relief. We are of opinion that this relief should be granted, but upon terms. It is a maxim, that he who seeks equity must do equity. Under all the circumstances of the case, it would not be right to set aside and vacate a part of the sale to Fenno, without rendering some remuneration to him for the money which he paid to Coulter on a debt which is admitted to be just; and whether the whole amount, or what amount should be refunded, cannot, under the present state of the pleadings, be ascertained, for the amount to which he is entitled must depend on the proportion in value, which the land, which he still holds under his purchase, bears to the whole purchase with interest, against which it is but just that a like account of rents and profits should be taken against Fen-no, if (as appears from the evidence) he has been in possession since his purchase. The complainant has not presented in his bill a state of case which would allow proof upon these points, and we cannot doubt but that before the prayer of the complainant’s bill should be allowed, a just remuneration should be rendered to Fenno for any sum of money he may have, in good faith paid. The complainant was clearly not entitled to the relief sought, until it was shown that the money paid by the defendant for the land, and which had been applied to the liquidation of Coulter’s debt had been paid or tendered. At the calling of the case for hearing, had the complainant asked leave to amend her bill in this respect, it would have been discretionary with the court to have allowed, such amendment or not. No offer to amend was made, and on the state of case presented the' court erred in decreeing that the deed should have been given up, and canceled; but should have decreed against the prayer of the bill. We must therefore set aside the decree, and remand the case to the court below. In doing so a question of practice arises in regard to the instructions to be given to that court when the case is sent back for its farther action. Shall we allow the complainant to amend her bill, so as to allow an account to be taken as to the sum really due to the defendant, and to which he is in good faith equitably entitled, or shall we direct that the suit be dismissed without prejudice to the rights of the parties ? We have, in several instances, pursued the latter course, and as the .facts of this case are materially different from those heretofore presented, we have again looked into the authorities, and upon examination of the cases, which we have heretofore decided, we find that in each of them an amendment would, in effect, have been the institution of a new suit, upon a distinct and independant claim or right. For instance; in Cook vs. Bronaugh, Eng. , the bill was for the specific execution of a contract, but it appeared that he might have asserted a claim for professional services, which were the consideration on which the special contract was based. The court refused to send the case back to the coui’t below, with leave to amend, because it would have been no amendment of a cause of action defectively stated, but the substitution of a new and different cause of action. And so, also, in the case of Maulding vs. Scott et al. Eng. . The bill set up title in the complainants to slaves, as heirs of the mother, who, it appeared upon the trial, had no title, but that the complainants had title as heirs of the father. The court refused to direct an amendment, because it would not be an amendment of a case defectively stated, but the statement of a new and independent title. The amendment, in the case before us, if allowed, would not be the substitution of a new right or claim, but the amendment of the original right, or claim to relief by an additional averment, so as to entitle her to relief upon her original cause of action. When the case is sent back to the court below reversed, it stands' just as it di'd before trial, and the action of that court is as full and unrestricted as it was before the case was tried, only so far as our decision and direction may limit and restrain its action. Shall we limit that discretion in this case by directing the dismissal of the case, with leave to file a new bill, or shall we permit an amendment to be made. The facts are now before us, and we may return the case for amendment, trial or dismissal ; or we may return it with discretionary power in the court below, to allow an amendment upon terms. The difference between this case and those heretofore decided, to which we have referred, is that an amendment in this case would, in effect, be a continuation of the old suit. The allegations, as far as they go, the issue and the proofs may stand, and with additional allegations, and proof may entitle the complainant to the specific relief sought. In the cases heretofore decided, it would have been the substitution of a new cause for equitable relief, with which such proofs and pleadings would have no connection, and would have been of no possible use. Amendments are allowable in the discretion of the courts, and usually upon terms of costs. If the complainant, as she has the parties and with allegations and proof, which may avail her in the further prosecution of the case, prefers to pay the costs which accrued in the case, up to and including the trial in the court below, and amend her bill, so as to entitle her to the relief sought, we think she should be permitted to do so, or should she decline to do this, that her bill should be dismissed without prejudice. Let the decree of the Pulaski Court in Chancery, be set aside and reversed, and the cause remanded to be proceeded with according to law and not inconsistent with this opinion. Watkins, C.

1862723,Perkins vs. Reagan,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Cross, Special Judge, delivered the opinion of the Court. This case comes up by appeal from the Washington Circuit Court. The record shows that Perkins, a citizen of the State of Missouri, filed his bill of complaint, and sued out process of subpoena, and a writ of injunction without having first filed in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court, the obligation of a responsible person residing in the State, acknowledging himself bound to pay all costs that might accrue in the suit, and that at the return term of such process the defendants filed their plea in abatement, alleging the omission, and “ that the said complainant was at, and before the filing said bill of complaint, and the suing out from before the Clerk of said Circuit Court, the said writs, a resident citizen of the State of Missouri, and from thence hitherto, hath been and still is a citizen of said State,” and praying judgment of dismissal, &c. This plea was verified by the affidavit of one of the defendants. Afterwards, and before any action was taken upon the plea, the complainant presented and asked leave to file the bond of a resident citizen of the State of Arkansas, conditioned to pay all the costs that might accrue, &c.; which bond was shown to be fully sufficient for that purpose; but the court refused to permit the same to be filed, and the plea being unanswered, entered a decree for the dismissal of complainant’s bill, &c. It is insisted that the court below erred in refusing the bond for costs, and dismissing the bill. The provisions of our statute bearing on the subject are, that “ in all suits in law or equitj^, where the plaintiff, or person for whose use the action is commenced, shall not be a resident of this State, the plaintiff"", or person for whose use the action is about to be brought, shall, before he institutes such suit, file in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court, in which the action is to be commenced, the obligation of some responsible person, being a resident of this State, by which he shall acknowledge himself bound to pay all costs which may accrue in such action,” and further, “If any such action shall be commenced without filing such obligation, the Circuit Court shall on motion dismiss the same,” &c. See Digest page , sec. and . Although the statute is in its phraseology, imperative, the exercise of a sound discretion by the Circuit Court, in cases analogous to the one under consideration, has heretofore been recognized in furtherance of justice, see Town vs. Evans, Eng. . Ib. Modglin & wife vs. Slay, . The provision of the statute being express, and this court having heretofore gone no further than to recognize the exercise of a sound discretion by the Circuit Court in such cases, we do not regard the present as an open question.

1862692,Sullivan ad. vs. Deadman,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the court. The administrator appealed to the Circuit Court, from a judgment of allowance in the Arkansas Probate Court, upon a claim exhibited by the appellee against the estate. The Circuit Court, on motion of the appellee, dismissed the appeal because the appellant had filed no bond for the costs of such appeal. From that decision the administrator has appealed to this court. No bond for costs is required on appeals from the Probate to the Circuit Courts. The 3d section of the act of January 4th, , applies only to appeals from the county courts, as decided in Biscoe vs. Madden, Eng. , overruling the case of Morrow vs. Walker, Eng. ; The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to proceed therein according to law.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862613,Price vs. The State Bank,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the court. The case here is, that the Bank exhibited her petition, under .the statute, against the appellant, alleging, that he, being indebted to her by note, in order to secure the payment of the same, executed his deed of mortgage to her of certain horses, and also of a tract of land, that the mortgage was duly acknowledged and recorded, and that consistently with its stipulations, the defendant Price, had continued in possession of the mortgaged property real and personal; that the debt remained wholly unpaid, and the condition of the deed had become forfeit: and praying judgment for the amount of the debt, with interest specified in the note and secured by the mortgage; that the defendant’s equity of redemption in the mortgaged property might be foreclosed, and the property decreed to be sold, and the proceeds applied to the payment of the debt. Price answered, admitting the indebtedness, and that he executed the mortgage, as alleged, in good faith, to secure the same; but that since its execution, the horses in question had died from disease while in his possession, without any fault or neglect of his; and that previous to the execution of the mortgage, one Charles Lewis had obtained a judgment against him, in the Circuit Court of the United States, for the Arkansas District, which was a lien upon the real estate described in the mortgage, and of which he was not aware at the time he executed it; that since then one Louis Refeld had become the purchaser, and was in possession of the land under execution had of the judgment in the Federal Court, and submitting that Refeld was a necessary party to the suit. The complainant then exhibited an amendment to her bill, against Price and Refeld, alleging that Refeld’s purchase was a sham, and collusive; that Refeld had bought the land with the money of Price, or held it by some secret agreement in trust for him. To this, the defendants answered, denying the fraud and combination charged; averring that the purchase by Refeld was in all respects fair and not colorable. Refeld set out his title under the Marshal’s sale, by virtue of which he had obtained control of the land, and relied on his title as a defence to the bill. At the hearing, upon bill, answer, replication and exhibits, it appearing that Refeld held the land by title superior to the mortgage, the bill was dismissed as to him; and because of the destruction of the personal property, no decree of foreclosure could be rendered; but the court decreed against the defendant, Price, that the complainant recover of him the amount of the debt and interest intended to be secured by the mortgage, and which remained unpaid. Upon the appeal of Price from this decree, it is contended for him, that the statutory remedy for foreclosure, if adopted, must be strictly pursued; and that whenever it appeared during the progress of the suit, that foreclosure could not be decreed because of the destruction of the personal property, and the failure of the mortgagor’s title to the realty, the bill should have been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, the complainant for the mere recovery of her debt having a plain and adequate remedy at law. Upon the reading of the statute, Digest, Title, Mortgages, it would seem difficult to determine whether the framers of it intended the proceeding to foreclose mortgages should be had in a court of law or a court of chancery. Yet we think, as held in McLain & Badgett vs. Smith, Ark. , that it is essentially a chancery proceeding, because, as now constituted, a court of chancery can, and a court of law cannot give effect to all the remedies contemplated by it. Without making any question whether the legislature, under the constitution, can deprive chancery of any of its peculiar jurisdiction, see Hempstead and Conway vs. Watkins, Eng. , or may not invest courts of law with chan-/ eery powers, the present statute does not intend to do either, but rather to enlarge the jurisdiction of chancery. The substantial provisions of the statute are, that mortgagees of real or personal estate, may proceed by petition in the Circuit Court, against the mortgagor, and the actual occupiers of any of the real estate, setting out the mortgage, praying that judgment may be rendered for the debt, and that the equity of redemption may be foreclosed, and that the mortgaged property may be sold to satisfy the amount due. All persons claiming an interest in the mortgaged property may be made defendants, and may plead any lawful matter in avoidance of the deed or debt. If upon trial, the mortgage money appears to be unpaid, the court is to render judgment for the debt, interest and costs, and make an order that the specific mortgaged property be sold, or so much as will be sufficient to satisfy the amount due. Upon this judgment or decree, a special writ of fieri facias issues describing the property, and commanding that it be sold to satisfy the mortgage debtso adjudged. The mortgagor has, in all cases, until the day of sale under the execution to redeem the mortgaged premises, by paying the amount due. The judgment or decree, as in other cases, is a general lien from its rendition upon the real estate of the mortgagor. If, upon the return of the special fieri facias, it appears that the mortgaged property failed to produce satisfaction of the debt, an execution may issue for the residue as on ordinary judgments. This statute, so far from affording a harsh remedy and to be strictly construed, as one in derogation of the common law, ought to be favored and liberally construed: because it affords a remedy at once simple and comprehensive, efficacious for the mortgagee, and equitable for the mortgagor. The statute does not take away, but its policy is to discourage, in practice, the common law right of the mortgagee to bring his action at law for the debt. Because, if the mortgagee obtains an independent judgment at law, the result might be exceedingly harsh and oppressive, if he be allowed to subject the estate of the debtor to the “sweeping desolation of an execution at law,” without exhausting the mortgaged property, which the one had given and the other accepted as security for the debt. So, if the execution be levied on the mortgaged property, the question would arise whether the sale bars the equity of redemption, or whether the purchaser acquires the property discharged from or subject to the-mortgage; either way, the property is sold under the cloud of the subsisting mortgage, and a door is open for the commission of frauds to evade a sacrifice of property. Although the common law doctrine of strict foreclosure is unknown to our law, or never resorted to in practice, yet the effect might be the same if the mortgagee can become the purchaser of the equity of redemption, under his judgment at law for the mortgage debt, and so unite in himself the equitable and the legal estate. But the statute carries out all the liberal notions of the law oí mortgages entertained at the present day. The mortgagor has the benefit of a fair public sale of the mortgaged premises, with assurance to the purchaser of a clear title, all the parties in interest having been before the court. The mortgagee has the benefit of the general lien of his judgment or decree for tbe debt, and, if this be not satisfied by the sale of the mortgaged property, he can at once sue out an ordinary execution for the residue, without being remitted to a court of law, to complete his remedy by obtaining a judgment in personam against the mortgagor for such residue. In McLain & Badgett vs. Smith, the matter decided was, thatii it be made to appear that there is a tenant in possession, not a party, the court will require him to be made a defendant, and or. failure of the complainant to comply with the order, will dismiss the bill. Apart from the statute, the same rule of decision will apply to all other persons interested in the subject of the litigation, if susceptible of being made parties. The report of the case of Jett vs. Cave & Schaffer, Ark. , is, that a decree was entered up for the amount of the debt and costs, and that the mortgaged property be sold to satisfy it; and this court reversed the decree, because it did not foreclose or bar the equity of redemption as prayed for in the petition, and which was thought to be an indispensable requisite of the statute. We must conclude that the opinion in that case was not well considered. It may be doubted whether the statute contemplates any formal decree of foreclosure, in order to bar the equity of redemption, (see sec. ,) and if it does, whether the decree for the debt, and for the sale of the property to satisfy it, is not a substantial compliance with the law. This point is much discussed, though without reference to any such statutory provision in the case of Lansing vs. Goelet, Cowen . And if the omission to enter a formal decree of foreclosure be not a compliance with the statute,, it is difficult to see how the mortgagor could complain of it as erroneous. The decision there evidently proceeds on the ground that the statute affords a remedy to be strictly pursued. Our views of the statute are altogether different. It is the only statute regulating the law of mortgages in this State. It is to be' apprehended that many unfortunate consequences would follow, if without such a controling statute, we should have to fall back upon the common law and the statutes of England, prior to the fourth year of James the First, to determine the rights growing, out of such contracts. Conceding the general proposition contended for by the appellant, that the defendant in chancery may object for the want of jurisdiction, because the complainant had an adequate remedy at law, by answer as well as by demurrer, and that the complainant may be turned out of court if the want of jurisdiction appear from the proofs at the hearing, else the submission of the parties to the forum might operate as a fraud upon the jurisdiction; yet, it should be borne in mind, that the evil to be guarded against is not so much the resort to chancery in the first instance, for relief, which a court of law can as well and more expeditiously afford; but it is the increase of litigation, the vexation and delay of a resort to chancery, to be relieved against judgments at law, where the complainant might have availed himself of the same ground of defence. But the objection taken by the appellant is not tenable upon what we conceive to be the proper construction of the statute,the design of which is to confer upon chancery a jurisdiction it had not before, viz : that of rendering a judgment in personam for the mortgage debt, and of enforcing it as an ordinary judgment at law, if not satisfied after exhausting the mortgaged property by sale under the decree of foreclosure. True, the mortgagee connot go into chancery, and ask merely for a decree or judgment for his debt. But on the face of this bill and exhibits the court of chancery had jurisdiction to decree foreclosure as well as to render judgment for the debt. Upon the suggestion of the appellant, the adverse rights of a third party were brought before the court, thus calling into exercise one of the peculiar powers of equity jurisdiction. In order to determine that the complainant was not entitled to a decree of foreclosure and sale of the realty as against Refeld, it necessarily took cognizance of the cause and did adjudicate it. A court of chancery having jurisdiction of a cause for one purpose, and having all the parties in interest before it, will do complete justice between them and end litigation by disposing of all the questions in the cause, though any of them separately be of legal cognizance. Here the complainant was entitled to all the relief prayed for as against the defendant Price, and would have obtained it but for bis own wrongful act. His objection that the court of chancery decreed only a paid of the rélief prayed for against him, has been determined without considering it to be unconscionable.

1862710,Arnett vs. Arnett et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1852-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walkee delivered the opinion of the Court. The complainant filed her bill against the heirs, and the administrator of the estate of William Arnett, and against Ephraim Myrick and Sheridan W. Williams, in which she alleges that she is the widow of said intestate, who died seized and possessed of two slaves, Green and Edy, in whom she claims a dower interest! The heirs and administrator do not contest the complainant’s right to dower; but Myrick and Williams, who have the slaves in possession, assert title to them as purchasers at judicial sale. By an agreed statement of the facts signed and entered of record, it is admitted that the slaves were duly levied upon and taken into possession on the first of January, , under a valid execution against the intestate: that after the levy and before the return day of the writ, on the 22d January, , the intestate died: that afterwards, at a regular sheriff’s sale, the defendants, Myrick and Williams, bought and paid for the slaves, and took them into possession. All other facts conceded, the question of contest was whether the intestate was so seized and possessed of the slaves at the time of his death as to entitle the widow to dower. The court below decided against her right to dower, and dismissed her bill. And in this she alleges there is error. The statute, Dig. ch. , sec. , provides that, “ A widow shall be entitled, as part of her dower, to one-third part of the slaves, ■whereof her husband died seized or possessed, during her natural life, and one-third part of the personal estate in her own right.” This section, unlike that which allows dower in real estate, limits the wife’s right to dower to the slaves of which the husband was, at the time of his death, seized or possessed, and cuts off all claim to dower where the slaves have been disposed of prior to his death, and this without her co-operation, or assent. The whole question then turns upon the effect of the levy, which, although insufficient to divest the defendant in execution of title to the property levied upon, for that does not pass until after sale, 'does, when made on personal estate, disseize the defendant and dispossess him of the property levied upon; for whether the officer takes the property into possession or not, it is, in contemplation of law, in his custody; he is responsible for it, and has a right to hold it against the claims of the defendant in execution, and all others. It is taken in satisfaction of the debt, and is held and taken as such until sold, or the levy is otherwise discharged. The levy, in this case, was not only a disseizin in law, but also in fact, for the property was not only actually taken out of his possession, but beyond the control of the defendant, or his power to reclaim or reduce it to possession by mere force of legal right. The defendant in execution, therefore, had not at the time of his death, such seizin or possession as to entitle the complain ant to dower in the slaves, and consequently there was no error in the decree of the court below.

1862663,Thompson vs. Bremage,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Courti This suit was instituted by attachment, in the Randolph Circuit Court. The writ was directed to the constable of Demeen Township, in Randolph county, to be by him executed and returned. At the return term the plaintiff moved to have the writ amended, so as to show according to the facts, that the reason why it was so directed, was that the offices both of sheriff an'd coroner of that county, were vacant at the time of its issuance; and at the same time, upon the ground of the omission of any such reason, the defendant moved to quash the writ. The court overruled the motion to amend, and sustained .the motion to quash. The act of December 21st, , provides that where the offices of sheriff and coroner of any county are both vacant, and so where there is no coroner, and the sheriff is interested in the suit, it shall be the duty of any constable of the county, to whom process may be directed, to execute and return it in the same manner as sheriffs and coroners are required by law to do. This statute was designed to facilitate the remedy, by substituting another class of executive officers in the place of the sheriff or coroner, whose appropriate duty it is to execute process of the Circuit Courts, in particular cases when those offices are vacant, or the officers themselves are disqualified; seeing that such vacancies or contingencies may happen, against which the laws cannot provide. The statute is not objectionable as tending to dispense with the office of sheriff or coroner, which the legislature could not do, but is rather to be commended as an effort on the part of the legislature to guard against any possible failure of justice, for want of the means appointed by law to attain that end. On the other hand, the adverse party to be affected by process issuing from the Circuit Court in civil cases, has the right to insist that such process shall be executed by its proper officer; because he is presumed to be a man of substance, personally responsible for his tortious acts, is under the immediate control of the court, and whose official bond, in cases where the securities are liable for his acts of commission or omission, furnishes ample indemnity against any abuse of the powers confided to him. And as the authority of the constable to act in the stead of the sheriff, is a special one and limited to the particular case, resting solely on the ground that there is no sheriff or coroner in commission, or none qualified to act, the fact of such vacancy, or disqualification ought to be suggested and recited in the writ, which then becomes the officer’s warrant, and a notification to the defendant of his authorityJ;o execute it; and it may well be pleaded in abatement of the process that such suggestion or recital is untrue in fact. But the omission of such recital does not make void the writ, which is, in legal contemplation, issued out of the court, presumed to know who are its officers; and whenever the power to issue such special process is conceded, no good reason is perceived why it does not come within the beneficial operation of the statute of amendments. We cannot suppose that the allowance of the amendment, proposed to be made in this case, according to the truth of the matter, could operate to the surprise or injury of the defendant, or deprive him of any substantial right affecting the merits of the suit. On the contrary, its allowance would conduce to the furtherance of justice. It is fair to presume that if the defendant is injured, it is by the want of authority in the constable to act, and not by means of the omission of the evidence of that authority. According to the opinion in Mitchell vs. Conley, at January term, , we conclude that the discretion of the court in refusing to allow the amendment was not rightly exercised, and for that reason the judgment ought to be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings, according to law and not inconsistent with this opinion.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862674,Adams ad. of Spears vs. Taylor; Taylor vs. Adams ad. of Spears,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. In February, , the intestate, Spears, exhibited his bill against Taylor, alleging that in the year , they formed a partnership in a saw mill, and that in the year , they also entered into a mercantile partnership in Jefferson county. That the partnership in the mill was dissolved some time in the summer of , and that the mercantile partnership was continued until about the month of January, . That profits were realized from both the concerns, which were wound up by Taylor, who had charge of the books and received the avails. The bill prayed discovery and account, and a decree for the balance ascertained to be due to the complainant. Taylor answered, that there was a partnership in two saw mills, one in a water mill commencing in , and the other in a steam mill. That the steam mill was put into operation about the first of January, , and some time during the spring of the same year the water mill was washed away. That there was also a partnership in a store, which continued from some time in the year until August, . That no profits were realized from either business, of which he exhibited accounts. That he had paid debts of the concerns beyond what assets he had received. That he was always ready and willing to settle, but complainant had left the State, and it was his own fault that there had been no settlement. He set up by way of answer the statute of limitations of three years as a bar to the relief. Subsequently, Taylor filed a cross bill re-asserting his answer with an enlarged statement of the business of the several partnerships, and of other transactionsbetween Spears andhimself, claiming a balance due to him by Spears, on a full settlement, praying an account and decree. Among the unsettled matters between them, he represented that, as the agent of Spears, who had left the country, he sold a tract of land belonging to Spears, and for the proceeds of which, he had given him credit on account of what Spears owed him. That Spears, who was insolvent, had recovered judgment against him on the law side of the court, for the proceeds of the land in question; and he prayed that this judgment might be enjoined and brought into the account to be stated between them. Spears answered, admitting the partnerships in the two mills and the store. He again gave his own version of the partnership transactions. He denied that he was insolvent. He insisted that the transaction about the sale of the land had no connection with the partnership business. And as to some items charged against him by Taylor, and which he alleged were transactions outside of the partnerships, he relied in his answer on the statute of limitations. He answered, that his action against Taylor to recover the proceeds of the land was pending, and no judgment had then been rendered in it. The two suits being at issue, by replications to the answers, both parties proceeded to take depositions! At a subsequent term, the court ordered that Spears desist from proceeding to execute the judgment at law, which he had in the meantime obtained against Taylor; and the master in chancery was directed to take and state an account of the matters in dispute between the parties. Additional depositions were taken before the master, and upon the coming in of his report, it was excepted to by Spears upon various grounds. At a subsequent term the death of Spears being suggested, his administrator was substituted, and the cause was submitted upon the exceptions to the master’s report. The court being of opinion that neither party was entitled to any relief, dismissed the original and cross bill at the costs of the respective complainants, from which decree both parties appealed. Such is a brief outline of the voluminous record of this cause ; the details of which are not material to the determination of the question, which we understand to be involved in the cause, and the only one upon which we can suppose the decision of the court below to have turned. In Tatam vs. Williams, Hare, , decided in , and the latest English case we meet with on this subject, the bill of a surviving partner seeking an account of partnership transactions, brought thirteen years after dissolution by death of one of the partners, was dismissed on the ground of lapse of time. The ¡Yíce Chancellor said, “ In this court there is direct and very high authority for the proposition that a court of equity will not, after six years acquiescence, unexplained by circumstances, or countervailed by acknowledgment, decree an account between a surviving partner, and the estate of a deceased partner,” citing Barber vs. Barber, Vesey . Ault vs. Goodrich, Russell , and Bridges vs. Mitchell, Gilbert's Eq. Rep. , and those cases were adhered to, notwithstanding the remarks of Lord Brougham and the apparent grounds of the decision by the House of Lords in the case of Robinson vs. Alexander, Bligh . It is to be collected from the case of Ray vs. Bogart, John. Cases , that, assuming eleven years as the period of delay unaccounted for, after dissolution of a partnership, a bill seeking an examination and settlement of the accounts will be dismissed where the statute of limitations is not pleaded or insisted on in the answer, though Judge Kent, who differed from a majority of the court of errors, doubted whether the statute of limitations applies where there is a mutual trust as between partners, and if it did, he thought the defence is waived unless insisted on. The circumstance that the estate of a deceased partner is sought to be charged is one that may often influence a court of chancery in refusing reief, so far as that may depend upon discretion, because of the supposed inability of the representatives of the deceased partner, to contend on equal terms with the survivor sand the statute of the State limiting claims against the estates of deceased persons, unless presented for probate and allowance within two years from the grant of letters, would no doubt have a material bearing upon cases of that description, where the statute of limitation has any application in chancery. But the decisions are not confined to cases where either of the partners had deceased. Where the statute applies in chancery, the denial of the relief does not depend on that circumstance. In Didier vs. Davidson, Barbour Chy. Rep. , this subject was considered, and upon the strength of the previous adjudged cases in New York, relief was denied on a bill for account, where there had been no dealings within six years, and the complainant and defendant were in full life. The case there was embarrassed by the exception in the statute of accounts between merchant and merchant. The statute of this State, in force 20th March, , does not retain this exception, but enacts in lieu of it, that in all cases of mutual dealings, the statute runs from the last item proved; and it seems to be settled in England, as well as in this country, that the accounts between partners respecting the profits or transactions of the firm, are not held to be within the saving in favor of accounts between merchant and merchant, where that exception exists. In express trusts, where one holds the legal title and another has the beneficial interest, and which, as between the trustee and ■cestui que trust are recognizable only in a court of equity, so long-as the trust created by the deed of the parties or the appointment of law, is recognized to exist, and for any purpose remains to be executed, the statute of limitations, as such, or the analogous bar by lapse of time or staleness of the demand can have no application. But implied trusts often depending on parol proof, which have to be established as well as enforced by the aid of a court of equity, and originating in some wrongful and fraudulent act of the party sought to be charged as trustee, which is a disavowal oí the relation, do come within the reason and policy of the statute. In such cases the party seeking to establish the trust, is supposed to have some remedy, though not an adequate one at law, against the trustee committing the wrongful act or conversion, upon which the law raises the trust by implication; and where the party seeking redress is apprised of his rights, or if they be fraudulently concealed from him, whenever the fraud is discovered, or might reasonably have become known, he must assert his rights in equity within the period limiting the analogous remedy at law, unless he come within some saving or exception. Else by merely going into another forum, he could evade the policy of the statute limiting actions atlaw. Conceding then that there is a quasi trust or confidence in the dealings between partners, it is not that kind of technical trust cognizable only in equity, and which excludes the operation of the statute. With equal reason such a claim to exemption from the statute could be made in all cases of bailment, agency and the various confidential relations in the transaction of business. Such is recognized to be the law in this country in numerous cases, among which, the leading one is that of Kane vs. Bloodgood, John. Chy. , and the authorities will be found collected on the subject in Murray's admr. vs. Mason's admr. Porter . See also Baker vs. Biddle, Baldwin's Rep. . In this case the partnerships were dissolved by the abandonment of Spears in . It does not appear that any settlement was attempted or that either party sought it. No circumstance of accident, fraud or concealment is alleged, which would now entitle the parties to the favor of equity. The bills are purely for an account and for discovery in aid of it. The bulk of the business was transacted ten years before the filing of the bill, and there does not appear to have been any transaction within eight years. Then recurring to the statute which limits all actions of accounts, assumpsit, or debt upon contracts not in writing, to three years; actions on promissory notes and contracts in writing not under seal, to five years; upon writings obligatory and j udgments to ten years; and the statute of non-claim against estates before adverted to, the policy which pervades it is sufficiently indicated; and where the statute applies courts of equity according to these rules, as well as courts of law ought to administer it. The case of McGuire vs. Ramsay, Eng. , does not necessarily conflict with the point actually decided'here, that the relation between co-partners does not create such a trust as will exempt a bill for a mere account and settlement, from the operation of the statute, but it maybe doubted whether that case did not go a great way in establishing an implied trust after lapse of time. For the same reasons that a defendant in chancery is not required in all cases to avail himself of the defence of limitation, by way of answer or by plea, as at law, but may demur where a defence, which the complainant by his allegations has anticipated without avoiding, appears to exist on the face of the bill, the objection that the claim is a stale one may be taken at the hearing, and when the proofs disclose such a case, the court may of its own motion deny relief to parties who have slept upon their rights; because while courts of chancery may have a discretion to determine the rights of parties seeking an adjudication, notwithstanding the lapse of time where the facts are not disputed or susceptible of being clearly ascertained; the reason why they refuse relief in accordance with a statute by which they are not expressly bound, is the fear of doing injustice, and the inability to afford relief, where the sources of testimony have become obscured or lost by lapse of time. The present case is peculiarly one of that description. The bar of the statute set up by Taylor in his answer, must be considered as waived by his cross bill, which deprived Spears of any election to dismiss the bill, and the court was free to settle the controversy between the parties, if the proofs gave assurance that it could be done with any degree of certainty or safety. But it appears that all the partnerships were mere parol agreements and as to the very terms and stipulations of which at the outset the answers of the parties themselves radically and irreconcilably.- In the two mills and the store, Taylor was in partnership with different persons, and Spears was let in as a sort of sub-partner with Taylor in his half interest in these concerns. No regular books of account were kept, and of such as were kept some are lost. The master did not attempt to take any account of the mercantile transactions. The mill accounts are complicated by the loss of rafts and disputes between the parties concerning receipts for lumber and disbursements for expenses, and for the hire and support of hands; and depending for elucidation upon the uncertain testimony of witnesses, who as they are competent by having no interest in the transactions, had no motive to understand or recollect them with accuracy. If injustice has been done by turning both parties out of court, it is to be regretted only as the result of their own laches, and for the reason that it cannot be clearly known whether injustice has been done, we conclude that the chancellor in refusing relief to either party, was influenced by just views of the law and his duty. The decree is affirmed.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862625,Ringgold vs. Waggoner,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. The appellant, who was the complainant below, exhibited his bill in chancery against John Waggoner, Edmund P. Waggoner, Edwin T. Burr and William Hooper, setting forth that he, being the assignee and owner of an obligation made by John W., for the payment of money to certain persons to whom he was justly indebted, dated the 1st of January, , and the same remaining due, and unpaid to the complainant, he, on the 3d day of January, , instituted suit to recover the same against John W. on the law side of the Independence Circuit Court, the process being returnable to the ensuing term,holden on the IstMonday in February, and on the 12th of February, , a day of that term, the complainant recovered judgment in his .action at law, against John W- for the amount of the debt and damages then in suit: that on the 27th day of January, , and while the action at law was pending, John W. who was the owner of a certain tract of land in that county, on which he resided, executed his deed of that date, conveying absolutely the land in question to Edmund P. for the consideration therein expressed, and acknowledged to have been received, of $, which deed was acknowledged by the grantor, and filed for record, on the 30th of the same month. That this conveyance was fraudulent and without consideration, and contrived between John W. and Edmund P. to hinder, delay and defraud the creditors of John W. and among them the complainant, whose suit was then pending, and at the same time and with the like intent, John W. gave a bill of sale absolute on its face, to Edmund P. of all his stock of horses, cattle, farming utensils and household furniture, for the nominal consideration of four hundred and twelve dollars, no part of which was paid. That these conveyances were fraudulent and void as against the complainant, and that the judgment at law, obtained by him, became and continued to be a lien upon the land in question as the property of John W. That on the 24th of October, , the defendant, Burr, procured a conveyance to him for the land in controversy, from Edmund P. for the consideration expressed, of six hundred dollars paid to him by Burr, which deed was acknowledged by Edmund P. and filed for record on the day of its date. That before Burr obtained this deed, the complainant notified him of the judgment he had obtained against John W., which was a lien upon the land in question by reason of the fraudulent conveyance from John W. to Edmund P., and that he. intended to have the land sold under his judgment as the property of John W., and that Burr, in other ways, had notice that the conveyance from John W. to Edmund P. was fraudulent and without consideration. That if Burr paid, or agreed to pay any thing as the consideration for the conveyance from Edmund P. to him, it was solely for the benefit of John W., and that in obtaining such deed he had colluded with the other defendants to enable John W. to hinder and delay his creditors. That the judgment at law in the complainant’s favor remaining unsatisfied, on the 19th day of June, , he caused execution to be issued thereon, returnable to August term following, which was levied upon the land in question as the property of the defendant, John W., which being duly advertised was exposed to sale by the sheriff under such execution, and the complainant became the purchaser, and the same was duly conveyed to him by sheriff’s deed, dated, acknowledged, and recorded on the 19th of August, . That, afterwards, the complainant obtained peaceable possession of the land in controversy, and the defendant, Hooper, acting under the authority of Burr, intruded himself into the possession, and withheld it from the complainant. A transcript of the judgment at law, execution and return, the deed from the sheriff to complainant, and copies of the deed and bill of sale from John W. to Edmund P., and of the deed from Edmund P. to the defendant, Burr, are made exhibits to the bill, which prays that the conveyances from John W. to Edmund P. and from him to Burr, be canceled as fraudulent, that the possession of the land be restored to the complainant, and his title thereto established and quieted, and for an account of the rents and profits against Burr and Hooper. A decree pro confesso was taken against the Waggoners and Hooper, and the cause was heard on the bill and exhibits, the answer of Burr, replication and the depositions on file. The court below being of opinion that the complainant had failed to show himself entitled to ""the relief prayed, dismissed the bill. Upon the facts proved, the fraudulent character of the conveyance from John W. to Edmund P. becomes transparent. The grantor was a man of family, involved in debt beyond his means, had been sued in a number of cases ; the grantee was his son, a young man without property, or credit, unless to a very limited extent, who was then living with his father, as a member of his family, and continued to live with him while he remained in the country; the deed was absolute, but no apparent change of ownership took place in the property, and John W. continued in possession as before, from the time of the conveyance to his son, until he abandoned the place subsequent to the purchase of it by Ringgold, under execution. No money was paid, either for the land or personal property, but it seems to have been the understanding that the sales were made to Edmund P. for the purpose of paying the debts of John W. The debts were not specified; and it does not appear that the grantee ever paid a cent. The deed for the land acknowledged the receipt of the consideration* when it had not been paid, and the grantor took no note or obligation for its payment. Besides these unmistakable badges of fraud, which, before a court of chancery passing upon the facts proven, are conclusive as to the fraudulent intent, there is proof of other circumstances, the cotemporaneous acts and declarations of the parties to these conveyances, all conducing to show that their intention was to prevent the creditors of John W. from taking his property in execution ; and the inevitable effect of the whole transaction was to hinder and delay his creditors. Such being the conclusion of fact, it follows that the conveyance from John W. to Edmund P. as against the complainant, was void, and the judgment, subsequently obtained by him, became a lien upon the land as the property and estate of the fraudulent grantor, and the complainant, by his purchase of the land under execution, acquired a valid title to it as against the parties to the fraudulent conveyance! The only question in the case is whether the defendant, Burr, is entitled to be protected as an innocent purchaser. Although the defence is informally set up, yet taking all the allegations of the answer together and in order to arrive at what appears to be the merits of the cause, we shall make no question here whether the answer is sufficient to let in proof of every substantial fact necessary to- constitute Burr an innocent purchaser. But there are some other statements in the answer that are to be considered in connection with the proof. Burr admits that after his purchase, and after the deed from Edmund P. to him had been filed for record, the complainant, Ringgold, notified him that he had a judgment against John W., which was a lien upon the land in question, and he intended to have it sold under it, and that the sale from John W. to Edmund P. was fraudulent and without consideration, &c., and he goes on to state that supposing what the complainant said was true, and that the judgment spoken of was a lien, he told the complainant that if such was the case, he would not contend for the land, and would do nothing the law did not sustain him in. That in a day or two afterwards, he saw Edmund P. and informed him of what the complainant had said, when Edmund P. earnestly denied all attempts or design, to defraud the complainant, and gave a narrative of the transaction, which, it would seem from the answer, was the first information Burr had of it, and was, in substance, that the conveyances from his father to him were fair, and that he was to pay the debts of his father as the consideration for them, that his father wished to prefer other creditors to the complainant, whom he did not acknowledge as a creditor, and did not intend to pay him unless compelled to do so, because that debt, or a large portion of it had been paid, for which no credits had been given! Burr states that he then took legal advice, and upon investigation became satisfied that the conveyance from John W. to Edmund P. was fair, that the complainant’s judgment was not a lien, and determined that ho would endeavor to hold the land under his purchase from Edmund P., and immediately notified the complainant that such was his intention. It must be inferred from the answer that the defendant means to say that all the information he had of the character of the conveyance from John W. to Edmund P., that the former was indebted, and that the latter had no means, was obtained after his purchase from Edmund P. was complete. He states further, that he paid, as part of the consideration a debt of Edmund P. to the State Bank, at Batesville, of about $ and to Edmund P. about $, and also transferred to him an account against his father for $. Numerous depositions on behalf of both parties were read in the cause, and excluding all the evidence that might have been objectionable, and regarding it in the most favorable light for the defendant, Burr, it does incontestibly prove the following facts : That Burr made two distinct contracts for the land in question and took two conveyances for it from Edmund P., within a few days of each other. That the first contract and conveyance were canceled, and at Burr’s solicitation the money, about $, which he had paid to Edmund P. on the purchase, was refunded to him! That the reason why the first contract was so canceled was, that Bürr had heard of Ringgold’s judgment against John W. and his claim upon the land in consequence of the alleged fraqd, and had become dissatisfied with the purchase. That before he purchased ho was informed of Ringgold’s claim to the land. That Edmund P. had not paid or assumed any debt for John W. in the ‘Bank: that Burr paid Edmund P. $ and not exceeding that sum; that he undertook to paya part of .the consideration by substituting his note in Bank for the indebtedness of John W., and as the residue of the consideration Edmund P. took up the indebtedness of John W. to Burr, amounting to about $. That John W. was, and had been for some time previous, notoriously insolvent; and that Edmund P. was destitute of means, that John W. was all the while in possession of the land and personal property, using it at his own; that all the parties lived in the same vicinity, and that Burr had full opportunity for being-apprised of all the circumstances material for him to know. Leaving out of view the positive proof of notice brought home to Burr, by at least two witnesses, we should be forced to the conclusion, from other circumstances in proof, that he had sufficient notice to have put him upon enquiry as a man of ordinary prudence and experience in business transactions; and when the means of information are afforded to a party, he will not be allowed to protect himself by the want of notice, because he did not choose to be informed. In a case involving no doubtful questions of law, and upon proofs apparently so plain we cannot hesitate to decide that the decree here appealed from is erroneous. The judgment of this court will be that the decree be reversed, and the cause remanded, with instructions to the Circuit Court to decree in favor of the complainant, that the conveyance for the land in controversy from John W. to Edmund P. Waggoner, and the conveyance for the same from him to the defendant, Burr, are void as against the complainant, and that the same be canceled; that the defendants surrender the posssession of the land to the complainant, and that his title thereto be as against them confirmed and quieted; that the defendants, Burr and Hooper, pay the complainant the value of the rents and profits of the land from the time it is shown to be in their possession at any time after the complainant’s purchase of the same under execution; and that the Circuit Court direct an account to be taken of such rents and profits, unless satisfied to decree the same upon the proofs already taken.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862650,Bell Ex Parte,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinon of the court. The estate of Daniel L. Jackson deceased, of which the appellant is administrator, appears to be of the value of the aggregate sum. of about two thousand four hundred and seventy dollars, consisting of personal property, part of which has been sold, and the residue delivered to the widow, at the appraised value, as part of her dower — debts due the estate by bonds and promissory notes, debts due by open account and some county scrip of the county of Monroe. In an account current rendered to the probate'court of that county, the administrator charged himself with these several varieties of assets, and besides taking credit for expenditures, for which he produced vouchers, deducted also a sum equal to ten per centum upon the entire actual value of the estate that came into his hands. The Probate court, upon examining the account and passing upon it, corrected it so far as to strike out the ten per centum as deducted and to allow five per centum. To that action of the court, the administrator excepted by his bill and appealed regularly to the Circuit Court of Monroe county, where the doings of the Probate court in the premises were affirmed, and he has now brought his case into this court by appeal. The appellant contends that the statute regulating the allowance of commissions to administrators, by way of compensation for their risk and trouble, (Dig. chap. sec. ,p. ) is applicable only to the collection of claims in favor of an estate, whether they be due by bond, note, bill or open account, and is therefore but an effort of the Legislature to fix the respective rates of commission for the collection of each particular claim that may be severally of a sum under one thousand dollars, of a sum between one thousand and five thousand, and of a sum above five thousand dollars. If this proposition were true, it could in no way benefit the appellant in this case, as it appears in this transcript, but the contrary. It cannot, however, be maintained as true, either by the letter or by the obvious spirit of the statute. The letter of the statute is express that the commissions to be allowed the administrator are, “for his risk and trouble in attending to the settlement of such estate,” not his risk and trouble in collecting any one demand, or even of all demands in favor of an estate. And it is obvious that the Legislature designed to regulate the whole matter of an administrator’s compensation, and not so much of his compensation only as had relation to his service in collecting claims in favor of an estate; because the mischief designed to be remedied must have been at least equal, if not greater, flowing from the exercise of the discretion of the probate court in making compensation for services and risks of an administrator, other than those relating to the collection of claims in favor of an estate. The statute, when thus understood as to the extent of its operation, does not take away the discretion of the probate court in fixing the compensation of administrators; but only fixes a limit beyond which the allowance for compensation shall not go: the language of the statute is, that the court “ shall allow such executor or administrator any sum not exceeding ten per centum,” &c.....“for his risk and trouble in attending to the settlement of such estate.” The probate court may therefore properly, in the exercise of a sound discretion, fix the compensation at a rate of commission less than the maximum allowed by law, while in another case, it might with equal propriety allow the maximum of ten per centum commission for the first one thousand dollars of the true value of the estate,'five per centum on the next four thousand dollars of that value, and three per centum for so much of that value as was beyond five thousand dollars. There is nothing in this record to show to us, that the probate court of Monroe county abused its discretion, thus limited by statute, in refusing to allow the appellant the maximum of ten per centum on the first thousand dollars of the aggregate value of the estate of his intestate, and in fixing his compensation for settling up the estate at five per centum on the aggregate value; and we therefore find no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court, which must be affirmed, with costs against the appellant.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862647,Phelan ad. vs. Dalson,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. This was action of replevin in the detinet. There was but one count, and in this it was alleged in the usual form, that the defendant had received the plaintiff’s horse, and although often requested had not delivered him, but unlawfully detained him. It was commenced against Malay in his lifetime, who having been afterwards killed by Dalson, his administrator, Phelan, interposed three pleas: first, non detinet', and in the other two, setting up property and the right of possession in deceased, Malay. Upon these pleas issues were joined, and submitted to a jury, who found for Dalson, and judgment was rendered accordingly. A new trial was moved on the part of the administrator, upon the ground of alleged exclusion of competent testimony and of misdirection of the jury. This motion was refused and the cause was brought here by appeal upon a bill of exceptions. From this, it appears that the line of defence relied upon and attempted to be established, was that the unqualified ownership in the horse in question, of the deceased Malay in his lifetime, was in no degree affected by the alleged purchase of Dalson; because that originated in fraud, and was consummated by the felonious act of knowingly paying the purchase money in counterfeit gold coin. To this end, the administrator, after proving by a witness, that in February, , Dalson came to the house of the deceased and offered him ninety dollars in gold for the horse; that he then left the house of the deceased, taking the horse along with him, accompanied by the deceased; that the deceased returned home after a short time, and forthwith handed over to the witness ninety dollars in gold pieces, which the witness then understood from the deceased, that he had received from Dalson in payment for the horse, then offered to prove by the same witness the following additional facts : That the deceased, Malay, had no other money in his house at that time : that he owed two debts in the neighborhood, one of fifty dollars and the other of forty-five dollars ; that about that time he paid these two debts with five dollar gold pieces : that the persons to whom these two several payments were made, ascertained that the gold pieces paid over to them by Malay were counterfeit gold coin, and immediately returned them to Malay, then in life: that soon'after these facts transpired, Dalson left the country, and took with him the horse in question: that he was pursued and arrested on a charge of passing feloniously, ninety dollars of counterfeit gold coin on the deceased, Malay, was brought back to the county where the alleged offence was committed, and there, after an examination by a competent court, was required to enter into a recognizance for his appearance before the Circuit Court of that county to answer that charge: that immediately afterwards Dalsonkilled Malay; and that certain eighteen pieces of counterfeit five dollar gold coin, then ready to be produced to the jury, were the same that had been paid over by Malay to the two persons before mentioned, to whom he owed the debts respectively. But the Circuit Court refused to permit any of these facts to be proven to the jury, because, as is stated in the bill of exceptions, “ that there was no proof nor offer on the part of the defendant to prove that the gold pieces alleged to be counterfeit, were the same paid by Dalson to the deceased.” It is true, that in this offer to produce testimony to the jury there was no offer to produce direct proof to establish the alleged fact that the counterfeit gold coin produced, were the same that were paid over by Dalson to Malay for the pui’chase money of the horse, but there was certainly an offer to prove a chain of facts and circumstances from which, although a conclusion to this effect would not necessarily follow, it might have been arrived at by the jury within their just province. Even in criminal cases of the highest grade, that kind of circumstantial evidence, classed by the elementary writers as uncertain, is admissible. But in such cases, “because of the more serious and irreparable nature of the consequences of a wrong decision, the jurors are required to be satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, or it is their duty to acquit him; the charge not being proved by that higher degree of evidence which the law demands. In civil cases it is sufficient if the evidence on the whole agrees with and supports the hypothesis which it is adduced to prove; but in criminal cases it must exclude every other hypothesis, but that of the guilt of the party. In both cases a verdict may be well founded on circumstances alone; and these often lead to a conclusion far more satisfactory than direct evidence can produce. ( Greenl. Ev., Ed. sec. , p. . The court below therefore erred in refusing to permit proof of the facts, and circumstances offered to be shown in evidence. Of their relevancy there could be no question, as it is clear that where property has been, obtained from the owner by a felonious act, his unqualified ownership is not in the least changed, and he may peaceably take it, in whose hands soever he may find it. (Long on Sales, page , , , and cases there cited. The ruling of the court in reference to instructions to the jury was substantially correct. But for the error touching the exclusion of evidence, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded to be proceeded with.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862662,Brown vs. Hutchings,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. On the 24th March, , Brown sued Hutchings before a justice of the peace, on a note for $ , payable the llth day of April, , with interest at the rate of per centum per'annum, from the 8th of September, , and obtained a judgment. Hutchings appealed to the Circuit Court of Pulaski county, and upon aerial de novo judgment was rendered for Hutchings, and Brown appealed to this court, having taken a bill of exceptions to the ruling of the Circuit Court in excluding certain testimony, and for alleged improper instructions to the jury. In the latter court, as well as in the former, non assumpsit and the statute of limitations were interposed, and upon the trial of the issues formed in short by consent, Brown, after having read in evidence the note sued on, proposed, in the language of his bill of exceptions, toread to the jury an- endorsement on the back thereof, in these words : “Rec’d two dollars, cents on this note, in recording, &c., in ;” and to prove aliunde that said endorsement was made on the note by the plaintiff before it was barred by the statute of limitation; but the court refused to admit such evidence, deciding that an actual part payment must be proved, and rejecting said endorsement, and the testimony proposed by the plaintiff to show that it was made before the note was barred: and upon this decision plaintiff closed his case, excepting to the decision of the court in so excluding such evidence. And thereupon, the defendant offering no evidence, the court told the jury to take the case and find from the face of the note whether it was barred or not, and that they had nothing to do with the endorsement thereon. To all of which the plaintiff excepted.” The endorsement, accompanied with the proposed evidence aliunde, was competent; because it conduced to establish the fact of the alleged part payment. Not that the endorsement of a eredit in any case of itself removes the statute bar; it has no such effect, but it is merely evidence to be considered by the jury among the circumstances going to show an actual part payment. And when proven to have been actually made by the lawful holder of the note, within the statute bar, it is admissible in evidence upon the general ground that at the time it was made, it was against the interest of such holder to make it. Its effect, when so admitted, as has been several times holden in this court, (Wood vs. Wyld, Eng. R. . State Bank vs. Wooddy et al, Eng. R. ) is to make aprima facie case for the plaintiff in the absence of other evidence to repel the presumption raised thereby. If other facts and circumstances shown in evidence repel these presumptions, the plaintiff must necessarily make further proof of the alleged part payment; otherwise he must fail. In the case of The State Bank vs. Woddy et al, those presumptions were repelled, and the prima facie case, which would have been otherwise for the Bank, was overset by the additional testimony, w’hich was introduced in her behalf. So, in any case, if circumstances tending to show that the endorsement was not made Iona fide, appear in the_ evidence adduced on either side, they should always be considered by the jury in coming to their conclusion whether or not an actual part payment was in fact made, as alleged and attempted to be proven by the endorsement, as a medium of evidence. If, for instance, a very small credit endorsed, was proven to have been made the day before the bar was complete on a large debt, this circumstance would be worthy of some consideration by the jury. Like any other fact, it is the especial province of the jury to determine from the evidence adduced before them, whether in such a case the part payment alleged was actually made. If they find that it was made, then in the absence of facts and circumstances in proof to the contrary, they would be authorized to find that it was appropriated by the debtor to the part payment of the debt upon which they had found it was paid. And on this foundation would be authorized to find a promise by the debtor to pay the balance of that debt, which promise, by force of the law removes the statute bar interposed as a defence. In the case at bar we have said that the endorsement in question, accompanied by the evidence aliunde offered, was admissible in evidence, because it conduced to prove the alleged part payment. This is certainly true in the case of a credit endorsed generally, or endorsed as paid in money, and we can conceive of no sound reason why the rule should not apply as well when the payment is endorsed as having been in labor and services, as in property, or in a note of an account, which would otherwise be matter of set off. Because, in either case, to enter a credit within the statute bar would be equally against the interest of the creditor, and it is manifest that, in all these cases, greater facility would be afforded the defendant to repel by proof the prima facie case made against him, as in this case, that Brown did not owe him the amount credited, or that he had never consented to such án appropriation of it, than when the endorsement might merely purport to be a credit generally, or one because of the payment of money. We think therefore that the court erred both in excluding the testimony and in giving instructions to the jury. Let the judgment be reversed, and the cause be remanded to be proceeded with.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862722,Byers as ad. vs. Fowler as ad. d. b. n. et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mri Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. This cause was brought up by appeal from the chancery side of Independence Circuit Court. It appears from the transcript sent up, in connection with what has been since certified into this court in obedience to its process, that on the 17th day of May, , Nathaniel Cox, in accordance with the Territorial statute of that day, filed his petition in the Independence Circuit Court against James Boswell, administrator of I-Iartvvell Boswell, deceased, Frances Ann Boswell, his widow, and Elvira D. Boswell, a minor, their only child, to foreclose a mortgage on certain lands. He set out a copy of the mortgage in the petition, admitted that the administrator had paid the sum of $ , on the 16th day of April, , and $, on the 19thMaróh, , on the mortgage debt, and prayed for a foreclosure for the residue of the original, debt of five thousand.dollars. At the November term , Fowler, having in the meantime married the minor daughter, appeared and was made a defendant also, and the cause was continued by consent. In the May term , the administrator and the widow severally answered that they believed the allegations of the petition to be true, but knew nothing of their own knowledge. The administrator set up the two partial payments mentioned in the petition, and the widow her claim of dower in the mortgaged lands, and the cause was continued by consent. From this time until the Decemberterm inclusive, the cause was'regularly continued. On the 24th day of Aug., , in vacation, James Lawson, jr., filed a sworn suggestion of the death of Cox, and grant of letters testamentary upon his estate to him by the Probate Court of Pulaski county, of the death of Frances Ann, the widow, and of the death of James Boswell, administrator of Hartwell, and of the grant of administration de bonis non, on the estate of the latter to Absalom Fowler, and caused a subpoena in the nature of a scire facias to be issued against Fowler and his wife, to show cause why the cause should not progress in the name of Lawson, administrator of Cox,. At the December term , Fowler, without entering his appearance, moved the court to quash the return on the scire facias, which was done, and the cause continued. From this time until the May term , Lawson, at each term made various efforts to progress with the cause, but was always repulsed, until finally, during that term, to wit: On the 6th June, , he was overthrown, it having been considered by the court, that the suit as to him should abate, that he should pay all costs that had accrued as to him, and be allowed to withdraw his exhibits theretofore filed. On the same day, to wit: the 6th of June, , Byers suggested in open court, that Cox had died intestate, that administration of his rights, credits and estate in Arkansas, had been regularly granted to him; that James Bosw’ell, the former administrator, and Frances Boswell, the widow of Hartwell Boswell, was also dead; that administration de bonis non on the estate of the latter, had been granted to Absalom Fowler, and prayed that the suit should be revived and proceed in his name as administrator of Cox against Fowler as ad., and in his own right, and that a subpoena in the nature of a scire facias issue against him, to show cause why it should not, and also against Joseph H. Egner as trustee for Fowler, and against John Ruddell. And thereupon Byers as administrator of Cox filed in court his amended and supplemental bill, and Fowler then, in proper person, appeared and waived process of subpoena, both for himself and as attorney for Egner and Ruddell, and leave of court having been granted to plead, answer, or demur at the next term, the cause was continued. In this bill he first alleges the grant of administration to Mm on CosCs estate in Arkansas, the death of the other persons heretofore mentioned as having died, and the grant of administration on Boswell’s estate to F°wler, and prays that the cause may be revived, and then by way of amendment and supplement alleges that F°wler and wife, in January, , by deed, conveyed a portion of the njortgaged lands to John Ruddell, who took the same, with notice of the mortgage and of this suit. That in September, , Fowler and wife conveyed to 'YYm. F, Denton the residue of the mortgaged lands in trust, to sell them, and out of the proceeds pay, first, all incumbrances upon the lands conveyed and pay the residue to Fowler, or in case Fowler should pay off the incumbrances himself, to convey the lands to him on demand, and alleging that the incumbrance contemplated was that of the mortgage of Cox. That after the conveyance to Dentonin trust, Mrs. Fowler had departed this life without issue, and that Den-ton, the trustee, had also died, and that since his death, Egner had been substituted as trustee by the chancellor; and charging, upon belief, that the bill of exchange for $, secured by the mortgage, was dated on the 3d day of May, , and payable on the first day of April thereafter, but was in fact and in truth drawn of the 16th day of April, and payable months after date, as recited in the mortgage deed, and alleging that there never was but one bill for $, drawn on and in favor of the same parties, and that the bill of exchange in question was then on file in the Probate Court of Independence county. That it was accepted and paid by Cox in his lifetime. That he did not know where the original mortgage deed was; and pi’aying that if he should afterwards find it, he might be allowed to use it in the progress and at the hearing of the cause : that the bill of exchange upon due presentment had been allowed against the estate of Hartwell Boswell, deceased, by James Boswell, administrator in his lifetime. And praying that this his amendment and supplement to the original bill of Cox be taken and made a part of the same: that Egner, Ruddell and Fowler answer the whole. That the residue of said mortgage debt, with interest be decreed to him as administrator of Cox, and that the equity of redemption of all the defendants, and all other persons in the mortgaged lands and tenements be foreclosed, and that they be sold to satisfy the amount found to be unpaid, with interest and costs, and that the defendants be required to do whatever may be needful to vest a complete title to the lands in the purchaser thereof. It does not appear that any process went out against the defendants; on the contrary, they entered their appearance, as we .have before stated; and at the March term , they filed their several answers. In several particulars the answers of Egner and Fowler maybe stated together. They show a further sale and conveyance of a part of the mortgaged lands in May, , to one James Mull, for the sum of $, its full value. They deny all knowledge of the mortgage, except that derived from the record of it, and from rumor; admit the marriage of Fowler, the death of Mrs. Fowler without issue: that during her lifetime the conveyances were made to Ruddell and Denton, respectively ; the death of James Boswell and Denton, and the widow of Hartwell Boswell, that Fowler and Byers administered respectively, as alleged. That Egner was substituted as trustee after the death of Denton, and. know nothing of the bill of exchange, or of its acceptance or payment beyond the record of the mortgage and rumor. Fowler’s answer also admits that the encumbrance, mentioned in the deed of conveyance to Denton, in trust, was the mortgage lien in controversy. That he knew nothing of any bill of exchange for $,, in connection with this controversy, other than that described in the mortgage deed, and of that had no other knowledge than that derived from the record of the mortgage deed, and from rumor; denied the supposed mistake as to date and time of maturity of the bill of exchange: alleged that until within two years from , he believed from this data that such a bill of exchange as that described in the mortgage deed existed, and under that impression had corresponded with Cox, and had made payments towards its discharge of more than twelve hundred dollars, in the years and ; but protested against being now prejudiced by such payments. Then sets up full payment of the mortgage debt, but prays, in case of an adverse decree, that Ruddell and Mull may be protected according to the principle of equity. Ruddell, in his answer, denies all knowledge of the bill of exchange, and of the mortgage deed, claims protection as a purchaser, for a valuable consideration without notice, and from lapse of time, and sets up the statute of limitations : then exhibits cross interrogatories, in the nature of a crossbill, praying that in case a decree shall be rendered in favor of Cox’s representatives, certain lands, not mortgaged, but included in the conveyance in trust to Denton, shall be first sold in satisfaction of the sum decreed. And in this prayer the answers of Fowler and Egner concur. To these answers the complainanl entered his replication, and then Egner, Byers and Fowler, filed their answers to Ruddell’s cross bill. Fowler and Egner fully admit that the lands conveyed by Fowler and wife to Denton in trust were designed primarily to-increase the security for the mortgage debt to Cox, if any portion-of it should be found unpaid, but protesting against any application of this fund unless the mortgage debt shall be fully established, agree that, if an}' decree shall be rendered in favor of Cox’s representative, the lands shall be sold in the order prayed for by Ruddell. Byers admits that the lands were conveyed to Denton in trust for the purpose alleged, and that they are situated in the county of Independence; but sets up that the conveyance was made by Fowler and wife, voluntarily, and without the knowledge of Cox, or his heirs or representatives, and that they, nor any of them, have ever done any thing to relieve or discharge the lands purchased by John Ruddell from Fowler and wife. At the September term, , the cause was finally heard upon the merits, and the opinion of the court being against the complainant, his bill was dismissed with costs. The first question made is, as to the competency and sufficiency of the evidence produced, that Cox, in his lifetime paid the draft against which the mortgage was designed to indemnify him; and it is insisted that, as against the heir of H. Boswell in a proceeding to subject land descended, in which predicament Fowler-presents himself, admissions of James Boswell, the administrator, would be incompetent, and that it would be alike incompetent to-prove the signature of Elkins .to a receipt endorsed on the bill of exchange acknowledging its payment from Cox, the acceptor, until a foundation had been laid for the introduction of such secondary evidence. It appears, however, that besides the testimony thus objected to, the complainant produced and proved to this point on the trial, the original mortgage deed, and an original bill of exchange, corresponding in all respects with that described in the mortgage, except that it was dated on the 3d of May and was payable on the first day of April following, and proved by T. R. Hyde, one of the firm in whose favor the bill was drawn, that this was the only bill of exchange for that sum ever drawn by Boswell .in his lifetime on Cox, in favor of the firm of T. Ri Hyde and Brother, of which he had any knowledge, and that Cox paid this bill. He recognizes the endorsement of T. R. Hyde & Brother, on this bill, and also the signature of Elkins as genuine, but does not recollect how the latter came to have any connection with the bill; he thinks, however, that the firm never parted with it without the money — its value. It is objected against the weight of this testimony of Hyde, that it is vague and uncertain, that he was only one member of the firm; that the firm, in all probability, had clerks and bookkeepers ; that he makes no reference at all to the books of the firm, which might, by possibility, exhibit many such drafts ; that such a reference might have refreshed his memory as to Elkins’ connection with the draft and other matters, and have enabled him to speak positively, and not express his inferences and thoughts, as he did to some extent; and that the deposition was not taken until some sixteen years after the facts testified to had transpired, when it could not reasonably be supposed that the defendants could readily find rebutting evidence, which may have been swept off by death. If these matters work hardship they cannot justly be laid at the door of Cox, or his representatives, as the face of this record testifies. An issue might have been formed and depositions taken before the expiration of fifteen year’s from the commencement of this proceeding, if the defendants from time to time had manifested more disposition to approach the merits of the controversy. And when the disposition of Hyde was taken, a few months after the issue was formed, the defendants had the privilege of cross examination, and by that means might have cleared up the very uncertainty of which he now complains, if in any way likely to operate to his prejudice. (Johnson vs. Cocks, use &c., Eng. R. .) Without then any aid from the testimony objected to as incompetent, we think that the possession of and proof of the authenticity of the mortgage deed, and of the bill of exchange produced by the complainant, in connection with the testimony of Hyde, makes a prima facie case for the complainant as to this point, which must prevail against the denial of the answers on belief, and any inference that may be drawn from the testimony of Ringgold, that Hartwell Boswell and Cox were “skillful business men, and if they reduced a matter or contract to writing, they would put it down on paper as they intended it.” Any inference from which testimony being, in our opinion, more than repelled by the residence of the parties respectively, the usual course of business between Batesville and New Orleans, and the probable conduct of this particular transaction in inference to the locality of the parties and usual course of trade. And we rest upon this conclusion, notwithstanding the array of authorities cited to show that where a party goes into a court of equity to reform a writing on the alleged ground of mistake, or otherwise seeks relief there upon the ground of mistake, that the proof of the alleged mistake must be strong and conclusive. This is not a proceeding of that character; but a proceeding to recover a mortgage debt and subject lands mortgaged to its payment, in which the matter of mistake is but incidental, and only concerns the evidence as to the main issue, like matters of every day occurrence in the courts of law, as where a party executes a note to an individual and commits an error in writing his name, or misdescribes some subject matter of a contract. The remedy in such cases is not based upon the mistake, but is had, in spite of it, upon the contract, the mistake nevertheless. Finding in the record no evidence to repel this prima facie case, and assuming the existence of the mortgage debt, we will proceed to the evidence of its payments. The payment of five hundred and ninety-two thirty-four Run* dredths dollars, on the 16th of May, , and of one thousand dollars on the 17th of March, , is admitted in the complainant’s bill as having been made by James Boswell, administrator. The payment of five hundred dollars by the same on the 12th of October, , is also satisfactorily shown by the receipt of Cox of that date, The payment of five hundred dollars in the draft of John Ringgold on Charles Baltzell, of Baltimore, some time in the year , is shown by the deposition of Ringgold-. Although it is insisted in argument that this latter payment is identical with that for which the receipt was given in October, , no evidence is produced on the part of the complainant to rebut this jorima facie evidence of two different payments in that year of $ each; one in cash, and the other in a draft realized by Cox “in some way,” as the witness testifies, and as no day is proven in that year for the latter payment, we shall find the same to have been made on the -st day of December, ., the day most favorable for the complainant. It is also proven satisfactorily that on the 1st day of February, , Absalom Fowler-paid to Trapnall & Cocke, as the attorneys of the heirs at law and other legal representatives of Cox, deceased, the sum of eleven hundred and fifteen dollars on account of the mortgage debt, by the assignment of a judgment in favor of A. Fonder vs. Wilson & Thorn in the Pulaski Circuit Court; and as it is not alleged or in any way shown that the amount of this judgment was not realized, and it appearing from the record that this transaction must necessarily have come to the knowledge of the complainant before his suit was brought into this court, and that he retained Mr. Trapnall (the survivor of the firm of Trapnall & Cocke) as his attorney in this cause, after the transaction must have come to his knowledge, we shall hold that he thereby ratified and adopted the act of receiving the assignment of this judgment in part payment of the mortgage debt, and find this payment made accordingly, as of the date of the receipt. We also find another payment of one hundred dollars made as of the date of February 6th, , by Egner, as trustee, to William Byers as attorney for the administrator and legal representatives of Cox, deceased, on account of the mortgage debt in question. It is insisted on the part of the defence, that beyond these several payments, which we have found, the evidence establishes other payments to the extent of a full satisfaction of the mort.gage debt proceeded for; and we shall now direct our attention to that question. The transcript from the Probate 'Court of Independence county, exhibits a partial settlement of James Boswell’s administration account made of the 5th and-6th of April, , commencing with an item as “brought forward” from a settlement made at October term, , by which he is charged with a balance in his hands at that settlement of $, ; to this is added $,-- , as a balance brought from a settlement at October term, , and the amount of $ , the amount of a supplemental! inventory, making an aggregate of $, , against him. From this are deducted divers items allowed him upon vouchers, and the settlement closes with leaving a balance of assets in his hands to the amount of $, . Of what this balance of assets] consists — whether in slaves or other property, or in dioses in action, and if so, whether likely to be made available or not, or whether already realized, in no way appears. George Thompson testifies that he was living with James Boswell at the time of his death, as he had been for several years before, and had the principal management of a tan yard; that, on some occasion, six or seven months before his death — or it might have been a less time, or a greater — he exhibited to the witness a large amount of silver money, in a drawer, “about a peck or a half peck,” and told him that it belonged to Hartwell Boswell’s estate, and that he (James Boswell) “ had a particular use for it and would not use it” — the witness wanting some of it. He gave witness some money, however, out of another drawer, to be laid out on account of the tan yard. The witness said he had never been in the habit of using, or counting such large sums of money and could not speak as to the amount. Thathe assisted in packing up the things about James Boswell’s house after his death, and saw no money then, and that he disposed of some stock of the estate to buy mourning clothes for the widow. Ringgold testified that James Boswell was not engaged in any extexrsive business for several years before his death; that'he was close and systematic in his business and very economical in his family. That a peck of silver money well packed would be $,, or if'a peck measure was filled cax’elessly, it would not hold more than fifteen or sixteen hundred dollar’s. That he had been a Cashier of a Bank, and in the habit of counting silver money. That James Boswell was in the habit of frequently talking to him about his business, and that he did not know of his having purchased property, or of his having gone into any speculation within two years of his death, in which he could have disposed of two thousand dollars. ■„ Egner testified that he had known James Boswell from the year , until October, , when he died. That he frequeixt]y talked to him about his business matters and about the Cox claim. That in the summer before he died he “tapped him on the shoulder and they took a seat on a bench, and he told him that the Cox claim would be paid, that that debt will now be paid with money Col. Fowler had collected from McHenry, on the Arkansas river.” That he “ understood him that that debt would be paid with the money on hand, and what Col. Fowler had collected was a small sum of some two or three hundred dollars, the balance of a claim of the estate of Hartwell Boswell against McHemy.” That afterwards, on the same day he told him “that he had five hundred dollars in Arkansas Bank bills deposited in the Bank at Batesville, which belonged to the estate of Hartwell Boswell,” which, he “understood” to be different money from that he had before spoken of. That he frequently spoke to the witness about the Cox debt, and manifested great anxiety that it should be paid, and told him that it was the “only debt which the estate owed.” That James Boswell’s manner of doing business was “very systematic and particular, as much so as any man he ever knew in his life.” That he had a general knowledge of Jas. Boswell’s business and would have “ known of any trade he could have made, whereby he would have used , or , or $ within two years before he died — was satisfied he could not have done so without the knowledge of the witness. That he never knew of his making any trade of any importance without consulting witness. That he did not speculate in those times. That he was not extravagant, and when he died left his widow destitute of money, and, for a number of years, she and her children were supported by her relations. Upon cross examination, he said it was his “ understanding” from the conversation with Boswell “ that with the money he had on hand and what Col. Fowler had collected, the Cox debt would then be paid,” “not that it was then paid, but that it would be paid, every thing was ready to pay.” We conceive that this statement of so much of the testimony as is most favorable to the defendant, without regard to any question as to the competency of any of it, and giving to the defendant all the benefit that he could possibly desire from a concession of the agency of James Boswell, for the representatives of Cox, as claimed on that side, presents the point nowunder examination in its strongest possible attitude for the defence. And yet it must be conceded that the case thus made d^es not come up to the proof of any payment at a-: and the most that could be claimed for it would be, that it would authorize payment to be presumed, in the absence of repelling proofs, to some amount ranging from fifteen hundred dollars to an amount falling short a few hundred dollars of the residue of the mortgage debt. It would be impossible to presume a complete payment of the residue of the debt, because upon the ground contended for by the defence (to wit: that an appropriation by Boswell, as administrator, of funds in his hands as such, to the claims of Cox’s representatives in his hands for collection, as agent for the' latter, was in law and equity equivalent to an actual payment to the representatives of Cox) the testimony of Egner shows distinctly that the five hundred dollars in Arkansas Bank notes, which Boswell had deposited in the Bank at Batesville, were not included in the sum with which the Cox debt was to be paid, and with equal distinctness that the two or three hundred dollars that Fowler had collected from McHenry were included in that sum, and it cannot be taken that this two or three hundred dollars had been at that time paid over by Fowler to Boswell, because, if so there could be no reason to discriminate between money then on ■hand, and that which had been collected by Fowler from McHenry, which is so emphatically made and repeated by Egner in his •deposition, and there is no evidence at all in the record that this, -or any other sum of money was ever paid to Boswell by Fowler! So far then from Egner’s testimony establishing a foundation from which the whole residue of the mortgage debt may be presumed to have been paid, it even negatives a presumption of a partial payment, until it should be shown, as it has not been, that Fowler paid over the two or three hundred dollars spoken of, as ■having been collected by him from McHenry. There is no ground to infer from Egner’s deposition, that all ■the money in hand, except that collected by Fowler from McHenry had been appropriated to the Cox debt, but that the whole •debt, as an entirety, would he paid with the aggregate of the sum •onhand axiá-ihat collected hy Fowler. Nor does the evidence of Ringgold and Thompson give any essential strength to the defence upon this point, admitting every word of the latter to be true, and giving the shape of sober fact to any possible creation of an imagination stimulated by the exhibition of such a “big pile” of silver money, as to be computed by measure rather than by count, because Thompson in express terms, testifies that the money was exhibited to him “as belonging to the estate of Hartwell Boswell;” and he says, it is true, that Boswell said “he had a particular use for it.” But there ■can be no pretence that Boswell spoke then as the agent of the -representatives-of Cox, for from the whole conversation deposed about, it is manifest that if he spoke for any one other than himself, as he plainly did, it must have been for those interested in the Boswell estate, of which he was administrator. The evidence then, when the fullest latitude is given to it, does not show any appropriation in fact, but simply an intention of the administrator to appropriate, at some -uncertain future time, in which sum intended to be appropriated, the five hundred dollars deposited in Bank are not included, while the contrary is true of the sum collected by Fowler of McHenry, of the subsequent paying over of which to Boswell there is no evidence. Nor any evidence of any subsequent acts or declarations of Boswell conducing to show that he ever afterwards took any action whatever in the premises. It seems then perfectly clear that there is no foundation for any presumption, in fact, that the entire residue of the mortgage debt was ever paid. It is contended, however, upon the ground that James Boswell was the agent of the representatives of Cox, to receive the mortgage debt from himself, as the administrator of Hartwell Boswell, that if the evidence shows money in his hands, arising from the estate of the latter, and no other debt against the estate of his intestate except the mortgage debt, that the law will presume that he holds the money in his capacity of agent, ■ and not in that of administrator. If this proposition be true, then although the money collected by Fowler may not have been paid over, nevertheless if the aggregate of the five hundred dollars added to such other sums as the evidence may show in his hands, should be equal to the residue of the mortgage debt, the law would presume the mortgage debt fully paid. But the proposition is not true. It is true only of those cases of double capacity where the party cannot sue himself as executor and creditor, or guardian. The more ancient rule of the common law was, that where such a double capacity was created by act of a party creditor, as would suspend an action, the debt or duty would be thereby extinguished. The more modern rule, instead of extinguishing the debt or duty, allows it to be satisfied by way of retainer. It was from this source that the law of retainer sprung. In cases where retainer was allowed, because otherwise there would be no remedy, as in cases where a party was both trustee and administrator of adverse rights, or executor and guardian, the law works a transmutation by its own force, and always presumes that a party having a double capacity, takes and holds in that capacity in which of right he ought to take and hold, and as to third persons, holds him bound to do so. In cases, however, where a party has another remedy besides that of retainer, there is no ground upon which to presume that he elects to retain until he manifests an intention to do so by some overt act, some affirmative action. And even in cases where there was no other remedy than by retainer, affirmative action has been held necessary in some cases, but the better opinion is as we have stated it. The double capacity of administrator and agent for a creditor of the estate, is certainly not one of the former class, and if in such case, the legal right of retainer exists at all, which to say the least, is doubtful, a party claiming its benefit, would have to show that an election to retain had been made. In any view then, of the case made for the defence by the testimony, when considered in its greatest latitude, and without reference to competency, and allowing every possible advantage to be derived from the agency of James Boswell, contended for, it is clear beyond peradventure, that there is no sufficient ground established to authorize a presumption either in law or in fact, that the entire residue of the mortgage debt bas been paid. Nor is there any case made by the defence in this connexion, or any other, for the application of the principle of equity contended for, that where one of two innocent parties must suffer from confidence reposed; that party ought to suffer whose act enabled the fraud or injury to be worked. If any loss or injury has fallen upon the heirs or representatives of Hartwell Boswell, in consequence of the alleged agency of James Boswell, it has been in no manner shown in this cause to any extent whatsoever. But much of the evidence of which we have given the defendant the full benefit in the views of the case which we have taken is altogether incompetent. It is very far from being the law that where an agency is established, it follows that the declarations of the agent are competent evidence, merely because they are his declarations. On the contrary, it may be safely said that, as mere declarations, they are never competent, because what one man says, not upon oath, cannot be evidence against another man, who was absent and had no opportunity, by any question or observation to set it right if incorrectly said. Nor, is it true, that the admissions of the agent can be fully as • similated to the admissions of the principal; because a mere assertion, or narrative or observation of the agent, although it may relate to the business of his agency, may be often easily distinguished from, and fall far short of an admission of the principal, made through the medium of his agent, and therefore could not be used against the latter; whereas every assertion, narrative or observation of the party himself, wherever or whenever made touching the business, may be proved against him. And hence, there maybe many material facts interesting to either party resting in the knowledge of the agent, which like any other facts may be proven by evidence, and not by the proof of mere assertions, or representation of those facts; and therefore, if sought to be established by the agent, must be established by his evidence under oath, and not by proving what he might have said about them, against one who was absent when he said it. Those admissions of the agent then, which are admissible against the principal, are not of the nature of hearsay evidence, strictly speaking, but are of the nature of original evidence more liberally speaking. “It is because the admission of the agent is a verbal act and part of the res gestee; that it is admissible at all.” ( Greenl. Ev. sec. .) The act and the words together, as an entirety, make the whole thing to be proved — the ultimate fact, (4th Wend. R. ,) and as such it may be established by any witness who saw and heard it, or by any other legal instrument of evidence which, may contain it. Ilence, all words of an agent which accompany his authoritative act, and tend to determine its quality, are always binding on the principal because he is bound by the act, and must be bound by the words which show its quality, and are therefore a part of it, though verbal. It was upon this principle that all that was said by an agent at the time of settlement of accounts, was held competent in the case cited from Wend. Rep., whereas, what he said about the settlement seventeen months afterwards, was not allowed to be proven, not because his agency had then expired, but because it was the mere representation or assertion of the agent, which the court say could not have been proven, “ if made one hour after the business was closed.” So in the case of Laughen vs. Allnult, Taunt. Rep. , letters of an agent sent abroad containing narratives of the transactions in which he was employed, were not allowed to be read against his principal, because not a part of the res gestee but merely an account of them. On the other hand, the answer of a deputy sheriff to an inquiry of the plaintiff’s attorney respecting the execution while in force, was admitted against the sheriff in the case of Matt vs. Kip, John. R. . because made in the course of the transaction, and to a party in interest, and hence considered a part of the act of the deputy touching the execution. So in the case of Wescott vs. Bradford, ( Wash. C. C. R. ,) the court considered that admissions of the deputy collector as to the cause of the seizure of some rum made at the time that Bradford signed the information against the vessel, were compepetent to be proved against the collector: but refused to admit like admissions made the same day after the seizure had been made and the rum in store. And there are numerous other cases, all to the same general effect that whatever an agent may say either before or after the making of a contract, or the doing of an authoritative act is not evidence against the’""principal unless it form a part of the res gestw, or has some^necessary connexion with it, and is thus a part of the contract, or act itself, although verbal. And evidence of what an agent may have thus said, is not admitted to prove the truth or falsity of what was said, because the principal is equally bound by what was said, whether it be true or false. (See generally Dunlap's, Paley’s Agency, 3d Amer. Edition, p. , note , and authorities there collected, and p. , note , and authorities collected.) When brought to the test of these legal principles, much of the deposition of Egner must be rejected as incompetent. It cannot be pretended that when the conversation between Egner and James Boswell occurred, that the latter was then engaged in the doing of any act in virtue of his employment of agent for the representatives of Cox, in the progress of the business of such agency, and that that conversation was part and parcel of such authoritative act, conducing to show its quality, or that the statements of Boswell to Egner were in response to inquiries of any one interested either in any business of the estate of Boswell, or of the estate of Cox, then in progress of being transacted, whereby the statements of Boswell could by possibility be construed into verbal acts for either estate. But on the contrary, they were voluntary statements of Boswell to an indifferent person, made by his own seeking, to unburthen his own mind in the expression of his gratification at the probable near approach of an event that he had long and anxiously desired to occur, and about which he may have been so long and so often baffled, that now when the thought had been begot, whether by sober fact or by the wish, he could not withstand the impulse to communicate it to a friend. All the statements then, of Boswell to Egner so much insisted upon by the defence, that the Cox debt would now be paid with certain funds, that five hundred dollars in Arkansas Bank notes belonging to the estate of Boswell, were deposited in Bank, and that the Cox debt was the only debt which the estate owed, were clearly incompetent as against the representatives of Cox. And when the deposition of Thompsonis brought to the same test, it cannot possibly amount, as competent evidence (tending in the least to show payment,) beyond proof that the “peck of silver money” belonged to the estate of his dead brother. Thompson, an employee of James Boswell, it seems, applied to the latter for money to be used in the business of the latter. In the act of thus attending to his own business, James Boswell exhibits this “peck of silver money” in a drawer by itself, and passes over the desired money out of another drawer. When the witness expressed a wish to have some of the “peck of silver money” Boswell told him he could not have it, as it belonged to Hart-well Boswell’s estate, and he wanted: it for a particular purpose.”' The substantive act in process of being done, about which all the evidence of Thompson relates, was an act of James Boswell in the transaction of his own business, and not any act in the transaction of any business of his brother’s estate: his verbal statements in strictness, but show the quality and become part and parcel of his own act, not any act in his representative capacity. Incidentally, however, to his own act in resisting the application of Thompson for some of the “peck of silver money,” he assumes to perform a duty of his representative character in refusing to use funds, which he says, are in his hands in that character. If this was a bona fide representative act, the words conduced to show its quality and become evidence that the money was indeed the money of the estate, and would be competent as far as it went against the representatives of Cox; but if, on the contrary, it was but a shift to evade the application of Thompson for some of the money, which, it is strongly infei'rable from his deposition, he wanted for his own purposes, and not for the purposes of Boswell, his emplojmr, as he did the money he received out of the other drawer, then the words but showed the quality of Boswell’s act in his own X’ight, and could not be competent evidence as against the representatives of Cox. Under this pex’plexity it is perhaps safer to hold that the woi’ds wei’e competent to show that the money belonged to the estate of Boswell, and let the doubt as to its competency go to its weight. As, however, in either event, James Boswell cannot possibly be supposed from the evidence of Thompson to have assumed any duty of his representative character beyond the mere preservation of the supposed funds held in his fiduciary character, in making this answer to Thompson, no words going beyond that duty could be competent as against the representatives of Cox, consequently the words, that “he had a particular use ¡for the money,” could not be competent at all, or if so to any extent, only to that of conducing to prove as part of the act of preserving the funds, that they were funds of the estate, and could not by possibility be competent to prove any appropriation of these funds to the payment of the mortgage debt, for there was no such act of payment assumed to be done primarily or incidentally, for such words to qualify and enter into. The very most that can possibly be made of the whole matter, as shown by Thompson’s deposition is, that primarily, James Boswell was acting in the transaction of his own private business, and that secondarily, he performed the representative duty .of refusing to use the funds of the estate of his intestate for his own private purposes. The fact that he did the latter and that he kept such funds in a separate drawer from his own, is in exact accordance with his duty as administrator, and with the exemplary character and accurate business habits of the man, as shown on the part of the defence; and therefore afford no presumption of the appropriation of the money to the payment of the mortgage debt as would have arisen, had it been shown that he was in the general habit of mixing his private funds with those of the estate, using but one common purse. Giving then, again, to the defence the utmost force of all that remains of the testimony, conducing to prove facts from which any further payments may be presumed than those we have found respectively, it amounts to but the establishment of the fact, and that by the testimony of Thompson, mainly, that James Boswell, in his character of administrator, had some uncertain amount of money in his hands, and upon this fact, in connection with the additional facts, that he was an agent of the representatives of Cox, to collect the money from himself as administrator of Hartwell Boswell, and was a man of accurate, cautious, and pains taking business habits, almost always consulting with the witnesses, Ringgold and Egner, in progressing with his matters of business, we are called upon to presume additional payments. There are several difficulties in our way in making such a presumption ; some of which are insurmountable. We have seen that the law will not presume a transmutation of the funds from Boswell, administrator, to Boswell, agent, as it would do, if all proper difficulties were removed, between Boswell, administrator, and Boswell, guardian, for instance, because the latter capacities are so incompatible that there could be no remedy by suit, and therefore the law steps in and affords the remedy by way of retainer; whereas, in this case the ordinary impediments to retainer in a proper case are not removed by the evidence — as by showing that there was no other possible use for the funds but to pay the mortgage debt: and in this case, where Cox’s representatives could have sued Boswell, administrator, although the same Boswell was the agent of Cox, the law does not step in and afford a remedy by way of retainer, until it be first shown, as it has not been, that Boswell, the administrator and agent, by some open act elected .to transmute the funds. And it is not probable that any court of competent jurisdiction would allow an administrator the amount of a payment claimed as having been made to himself, as agent, unless distinctly shown, and until after the most thorough scrutiny, if at all. And so far from the proof of the business habits of James Boswell, and of his habitual free communications with his friends, Ringgold and Egner, affording us aid in malting the desired presumption of payment, even if the links in the testimony, which we have indicated, were not wanting, they tend strongly to the contrary, and we can but feel that they militate against the verity of Thompson’s statements, as to his having seen the “peck of silver money;” which, on the other hand, might be sustained by some circumstances that would allow'of his having seen some few hundred, which his inexperienced eyes might have caused his imagination to magnify. For it can but seem remarkable that, upon the part of the defence, some trace of the outgoings of so much money should not have been shown by the evidence of these witnesses, which is so full and explicit that there was no money on hand at the death of James Boswell. If it had been paid out in Bates-ville, a man of James Boswell’s business habits and free intercourse with Ringgold and Egner, as shown by the testimony, would scarcely havegacted without leaving some trace in the knowledge of these witnesses; nor is the probability less, if he had remitted it by mail, as to some fact connected with the remittance being within their knowledge. And having now first found that the complainant had made out his case, and that towards the satisfaction of the mortgage debt certain partial payments have been from time to time made, of the sums and as of the dates that we have specified respectively ; and lastly that no further payments have been made, or can be presumed for the defendants, we deem it totally unnecessary to go further into the testimony, either to strengthen the complainant’s case, or to weaken the probabilities that any further payments have been made than those that we have found, although there are several facts and circumstances, other than those we have noticed, which tend to both ends, and to fortify our conclusions, both as to the complainant’s equity in the matter of the mortgage debt, and as to the total want of defendant’s equity on account of partial payments towards its satisfaction, beyond what we have allowed. Having, as we conceive, said enough for the foundation of our judgment, that the complainant should have a decree for the residue of the mortgage debt. The claims of Ruddell and Egner, and that set up on behalf of Mull, that they were purchasers for a valuable consideration without-notice, are totally inadmissible. They were all purchasers, not only with notice by the registry of the mortgage deed, but were purchasers pendente lite. It is a mistake to suppose that there was any chasm in the proceedings, or, at any rate, any such chasm as would let these parties out from being purchasers pendente lite. It is true there is no express order of court making Lawson a party complainant, but the court allowed process to go out in his name, allowed him to file an amended bill, and other pleadings, and in various ways treated him as a party complainant, and finally rendered a judgment against him for costs, when under an erroneous idea of its power to reverse the proceedings of the Pi’obate Court of Pulaski county, it ordered the suit to abate as to him. We have, therefore the most abundant ground upon which to presume that a formal order of court was made, admitting him to become a party complainant, when he first went into court as a suitor. And when the suit was after-wards abated as to Lawson, it was forthwith revived in the name of Byers, administrator, in whose name it progressed to the final decree. We think, therefore, that the lands in controversy are clearly subject to the mortgage debt; that the equity of redemption in them should be foreclosed ; that they should be sold, and the proceeds applied towards its satisfaction, and the defendants should be decreed to do whatever may be needful to perfect title in the purchasers. The cross equity set up by Ruddell, is conceded by Fowler and Egner, and they concur in his prayer for the relief based upon it. Byers, as administrator of Cox, however, insists upon his rights, and concedes nothing. To the extpnt that the prayer of Ruddell (thus concurred in by Fowler and Egner) craves relief by a decree that certain lands, not included in the mortgage to Cox, (but conveyed by Fowler and wife, along with a portion of the mortgaged land to Denton, as trustee, for this purpose,) shall be first sold, and then that the mortgaged lands shall be sold, may be well granted, without militating against the right of Byers, as administrator of Cox. And relief to that extent should therefore be decreed for Ruddell; and then further effort for his relief may be safely made by directing that next afterwards, such of the mortgaged lands as were not sold to Ruddell, shall be then sold, and in the last place, thatthe residue of the mortgaged lands, being those sold by Fowler to Ruddell, shall be sold. The relief sought for Mull, is inadmissible. In order to ascertain the residue of the mortgage debt, for which the decree shall be rendered in favor of Byers, administrator of Cox, against the defendants, interest must be computed at the rate of five per centum per annum, from the first day of April, A. D. , upon the sum of five thousand dollars, up to the 16th of May, of that year, and added to the principal sum, and from that aggregate, the first payment, which we have specified, must be deducted; then interest at the same rate must be computed on the balance found from the 16th of May, , up to the 17th of March, A. D. , when the payment of one thousand dollars was made, and so on until the last payment shall have been deducted, and then the decree shall be rendered for the balance thus found due, together with costs, with interest at the same rate until paid by a sale of the lands or otherwise. And this decree must be so restricted as to extend only in its effects against the lands in controversy, specified in the bill and cross bill, although in terms against the defendants, there being no grounds of relief laid in the bill beyond such as may be had by a sale of the lands in question. The decree of the Circuit Court of Independence county, must therefore be reversed, and the cause remanded to that court, with instructions to enter up a decree in accordance with this opinion, and to execute it accordingly.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral

This was a proceeding by petition for a mandamus to compel the defendant, as sheriff, to acknowledge a deed for certain lands, which the petitioner claims as purchaser at a judicial sale. The petition is very full, as are also the recitals in the alternative writof mandamus. The substance of the ground for mandamus, is, that the defendant, as sheriff, offered for sale certain lots of land, as the property of the Bank : that Johnson, at the instance of the state, and for her benefit, bid off the land: that the State has been, and is yet ready and willing to pay the sum bid and has tendered the same to the sheriff, who refused to receive it: that the sheriff well knowing these facts, executed and delivered to Johnson a deed to the State for said land: that the sheriff refuses to acknowledge such deed. And prays that he be required to do so, or to show cause why he should not be compelled so to do. The defendant declined acknowledging the deed,and for cause shows, that the land was bid off by Johnson, as the attorney for the Bank, and that the petitioner was wholly unknown to him as purchaser: that he applied to Johnson for the sum bid which he refused to pay; that under the statute, upon such refusal, it became his duty to re-offer the property for sale, and that he did at the time and place, re-offer said land for sale, and sold it to Thomas W. Newton, to whom he executed and acknowledged a deed. Pie positively denies that either Johnson or the State or any one for them, tendered or offered the sum bid, until long after the complete consummation of the second sale to Newton, but admits a tender by the State after that time. That his deputy took lists of the sales and made out deeds for the purchasers; that he has no recollection of having either signed or delivered a deed for the land either to Johnson or the State. He is positive that he never intended to do so: that deeds were made out and signed, ready to be delivered when the purchase money was paid. Such deeds were usually kept in a box in the clerk’s desk, and may have been taken without his knowledge. To this response the State made two replications: first, that the respondent did not again offer said lots for sale, at the time and place at which the first sale was made: second, that he did execute such deed to the State for said lots, and that the same is his act anddeed. The first of these replications concludes to the country the second, with a verification. And issues being taken upon them, they were submitted for trial to the court sitting as a jury. After hearing the evidence the court found for the defendant and rendered judgment accordingly. No exception was taken to the opinion of the court on a question of law, except as to the admissibilit}r of a certain deposition. And as there was no motion for a new trial, the correctness of the decision of the court in excluding such evidence presents the only legitimate question to be determined. The objection to the deposition, was that the official character of the justice, before whom the same was taken in Kentucky, was not sufficiently authenticated, in this, that what purported to be the seal of'the Jefferson Circuit Court, was an impression upon paper, without wax or other soft tenacious substance. The court held this objection good and excluded the deposition. In this the court erred. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the court should have presumed in favor of the regularity of the proceeding from the sister State. There may have been a statute there like our own, declaring that an impression upon paper shall be a sufficient sealing: and whether this be the case or not, the later decisions of the courts go to discourage the objection and hold it frivolous. Pillow vs. Roberts, How. U. S. S. C. Rep. . Eng. . But then the question recurs, admitting the depositions to be in other respects, unexceptionable, were they admissible under the issue formed by the parties? Waiving the consideration of the question whether a writ of mandamus is the appropriate remedy in this case, which we think extremely doubtful, and conceding the power of the court to compel the officer to perform a legal duty, still the court would not exercise such power until a clear legal duty was shown, and it was made to appear that the officer had failed or refused to perform it. In this case the sheriff is called upon to acknowledge a deed, which purports to have been executed by him as such to the petitioner. It is conceded that the bid was made by Johnson, and it is not shown that the sheriff was aware that the State had any interest in the bid uuless after the second sale of the property; but so far from this, the sheriff, in his answer under oath, positively de nies all knowledge of the fact until after the second sale: And this answer must be taken as true, because it is not questioned by replication, nor is it disproven by other evidence. The sheriff thus is cut off from all knowledge of the acts of the State. He could not request her to pay, because she was unknown to him; and for the same reason an ability or readiness to pay by the Bank, not having been brought home to the sheriff, amounted to nothing. Thus left with Johnson, as the only known bidder, who refused to pay the sum bid, the sheriff, in obedience to the statute, re-offered the property, and sold it to a second bidder, who paid the sum bid to the sheriff. This second sale was a revocation, under authority of the statute, of the first bid; and no act of Johnson’s after that time could restore him to the rights which he had lost by refusing to pay the sum bid when called upon. The first replication is intended to put in issue the time when the second sale took place. This we have held, if true, a mere erroneous exercise of power which did not affect the validity of the sale. Newton vs. State Bank. And concede that the State did tender the money bid by Johnson, and claim the benefit of his bid, after the resale of the property, this could not coaler a right on her to demand a deed for the property; because the bid under which she claimed was abandoned by the refusal of the only known bidder to pay the sum bid, and because the second bidder had succeeded to all his rights. The deed subsequently found in the possession of Johnson, bears date eight days after the second sale of the property, and, if the contents of the deed are to be received as evidence, it must be taken all together, and would show prima facie a deed signed and delivered to Johnson at that date. If so, it was an act not warranted by law, and of course would not be consummated by acknowledgment, by the sanction of a court. Under the circumstances of the case, after the sale to Newton, the first bidder stood in no better situation than any one else; his bid was forfeited; there was no bid; a mere stranger had as much right to demand a deed as he had. But the sheriff positively denies the execution of the deed, and there is no proof of its execution except that arising from presumption: but if there was proof upon this point, it would not avail. It is not true, as the counsel for the State seem to suppose that the sheriff may charge himself with the sum bid and dispense with the payment of the money. This question was discussed at length in the case of Dickson vs. Gilliland, Cow Rep. . In that case the sheriff received a large amount of the money and made a deed to the junior lien creditor under the New York statute. The first purchaser, at the expiration of the time allowed him to redeem, claimed a deed, and it was ordered to be made to him, upon the ground that the sheriff had no right to make the deed until the whole of the purchase money was paid. The policy of the law forbids that sheriffs should be permitted to substitute themselves as debtors to the creditor. But even if this was permitted, it is evident that no court would compel the sheriff to do so. Nor will the readiness of the State to pay authorize a deed after the second sale, because the sheriff has exhausted his power and authority by a sale, and the receipt of the purchase money under it.' Returning theivto. the only question of law raised by the assignment of errors, the admissibility of the deposition as evidence, limited in its application to the issues formed upon the replication, to the return of the sheriff on the writ of mandamus, we are of opinion that had it been admitted and had proven every fact put in issue by the replications, that still upon the whole case, the decision of the court was right, because the execution of the deed should have been before the sale to Newton and upon payment of'the money.

1862700,Dooley et al. Ex. vs. Dooley et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1850-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court. The bill in this case is filed to compel the defendants, who are the legatees under the will of Thomas Dooley, to refund to complainants, the executors of said estate, so much Of the specific legacies paid over to them as may be necessary to pay $ , a balance in favor of the complainants, upon final settlement of the estate. The defence to these allegations was, not that defendants were not the legatees, or had not received the specific legacies; nor was it that no settlement had been made with the Probate Court showing that such balance was due to the complainants. But they attempted to set up in defence against the bill that the settlement made with the Probate Court was unjust and fraudulent, and upon this point have introduced a mass of evidence, tending to prove that the complainants had not charged themselves in settlement with a large amount of money and property, which came to their hands, and for which they were accountable as executors. Under the issue thus formed the main question is, as to whether the evidence was or not admissible to show a different state of accounts from that presented by the record. If the defendants had filed a cross bill alleging fraud, accident, or mistake in the settlement, and thereby made a direct issue upon the validity of the settlement, there is no doubt but that the evidence tending to prove such fraud might have been admitted: but such was not the case. And as so much of the answers as was intended to present this issue in the nature of a cross bill, was stricken out by demurrer, the simple question arises as to the admissibility of the evidence (on a collateral issue) to contradict the record evidence of settlement. This, we think, could not be done, because it was the record evidence of a settlement made by a court of competent jurisdiction, and must be received as conclusive evidence of the state of accounts and the balance due, until falsified by a direct proceeding putting in issue its truth. It is not sufficient, in order to admit such evidence, to show that the proceedings, under which the settlement was made, wei'e ii'regular, as for instance (as in this case) where it, does not appear that notice was given of the time and place of settlement, as required by the statute. Such ix’regularities may render the proceedings erroneous and voidable; but until they are avoided, unless absolutely void, they are entitled to the same credit as if in all respects regular. Borden vs. State use &c., Eng . But the defendants contend that as the settlement in this case was made under the territorial statute which does not deny the right to impeach the settlement when made, unless by bill in chancery for fraud, as our present statute does, that therefore such settlement may be impeached and falsified in a collateral proceeding. If this position be true, then in every instance where there is no express statute forbidding it, the truth of a record might be impeached in a collateral proceeding by extrinsic evidence; and the distinction between parol and record evidence broken down. So far from this, in the absence of any statute upon the subject, we do not hesitate, upon general principles of law, to hold that the record evidence of settlement can only be impeached by a direct proceeding in chancery for that purpose. So long as it remains a record, it is to be held as conclusive evidence of the facts therein contained. It follows, therefore, that the whole of the evidence offered in this case to show a different state of accounts from that shown by the record, was irrelevant and inadmissible. If the defendants had appealed from the decision of the court, in sustaining a demurrer to so much of their answer as was in-, tended as a cross bill, the question as to its sufficiency would have been presented for our consideration; but as they have not complained of that decision as error, it becomes unnecessary for us to examine that point. Indeed the scope of our inquiry is limited to an enquiry as to the equitable rights of the complainants, upon facts which are, in effect, admitted by the answers to be true, for the denial of the truth of the settlements in effect, amounted to nothing. The complainants, upon the facts properly admissible under the issue were clearly entitled to relief, and the Circuit Court erred in dismissing 1heir bill with costs. The decree of the Lafayette Circuit Court in chancery, must be reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions to render a decree herein, in favor of complainants in accordance with the prayer of their bill.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral

The facts in this case are substantially the same as in that of the complainants against the heirs of Thomas Dooly, deceased, decided at the present term. Duty and wife are legatees under the same will, and the suit, as in that case, is brought to compel the defendants to refund a proportionate part of their legacy for the payment of a sum of money paid out by the executors in the settlement of the debts of the estate. The same pleadings were filed, the same decision made with regard to them: the same evidence offered in both and the same decree; so that the decision of the case of the complainants against the heirs of Thomas Dooley, will be held as decisive of all the questions which arose in this. The court below erred in dismissing complainant’s bill, and in decreeing costs against them ; and for this error the decree must be set aside and reversed, and the cause remanded to the court below, with instructions to ascertain the proportionate part which the defendants should refund, out of their specific legacy, and render a decree for the same in favor of complainants, and if necessary to take additional proofs touching the sum to be re’ funded.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862611,Ellis vs. Dunham,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. Leaving out of view extraneous matters, the material facts, as admitted or proven, on the trial of this cause, appear to be as follows: One Malone made his writing obligatory for the p&yment of money to Ellis, (the defendant below) dated October , , anddue six months after date. On the 12th of June , and after the obligation became due, Ellis assigned it to one Hough, who, on the 10th of November, , assigned it to Dunham (the plaintiff below). Hough and Dunham, respectively demanded payment of Malone,' who did not pay, but when such demands were made, does not appear; nor does it appear that any notice of the demands upon Malone, and his refusal to pay, was given to Ellis, until the day before the suit was commenced, when he was notified in writing, by Dunham, of such demand and refusal, and that he would be held liable upon his assignment. The suit was commenced on the 26th day of April, . The parties lived in adjoining counties, the defendant about fifty miles, and Malone about fifteen miles from the plaintiff below. We take the fact, about which there was conflicting testimony, to be found by the verdict, that at the time of the assignment by the defendant to Hough, Malone the obligor was insolvent. Among the various instructions asked for by both parties, the court, on the motion of the plaintiff, and against the objection of the defendant, charged the jury, to the effect, that if they believed from the evidence that Malone, the maker of the bond, was insolvent at the time the assignment of it was made by Ellis to Hough, the assignment was an original guaranty of the payment of the bond, and the defendant’s liability was fixed instantly, and the assignee was not bound to make demand of payment from Malone and give notice of non-payment, because he would not be required to do a useless act. Also, that if Ellis assigned the bond after due, such an endorsement was an original undertaking on his part, that the bond should be paid, and that no demand of payment of Malone, or notice of his refusal to pay, was necessary to fix the liability of Ellis."" Also, that the bond being assigned after due, if they believed that both Hough and the plaintiff demanded payment of Malone, and he refused payment, and that the plaintiff gave the defendant notice of the demand upon the maker, and his refusal, at any time before the commencement of the suit, it was sufficient to fix the defendant’s liability. On the other hand the court, at the request of the defendant, refused to instruct the jury, to the effect that the defendant could not be made liable on his assignment, unless the plaintiff had given him reasonable, or due notice of non-payment by the obligor : also, that if the jury believed from the evidence that the holder used no exertions to collect the note for several years, he thereby discharged the endorser. These instructions would seem to have been given and refused under an entire misapprehension of the law. If the plaintiff sought to recover under what may be called the old law of assignments — see Morse vs. Johnson, decided at January term, , he could only do so against his immediate assignor, upon the contract of assignment, by showing that he had used due diligence in suing the obligor or party primaiily liable, and in prosecuting him to insolvency, not reputed but legal insolvency, evidenced by discharge under the insolvent acts from arrest upon ca. sa., or a return of nulla bona. But the assignee in this case, in order to recover against a remote assignor, between whom and himself, there was no privity of contract, must have availed himself of so much of the statute of assignments of , Digest, Title, Assignments, sec. , as is introductory of the law merchant and of its analogous rules. The bond here being assigned after due, the nature of the contract is that the endorsement is equivalent to the drawing of a new bill by the endorser upon the maker or obligor, who stands as acceptor of it, in favor of the endorsee, and payable on demand. And in order to charge the endorser in such case, his contract being conditional upon receiving due notice of non-payment, as at the law merchant, the assignee or endorsee (for under this statute they seem to be convertible terms) must use reasonable diligence in presenting the bond or note, to the maker for payment. The time and manner of giving the notice would be governed by the rules of the law merchant in similar cases. What would be reasonable diligence in making the demand of payment, might often be a mixed question of law and fact for the jury to determine, under the instructions of the court, and according. as they may find the facts proven. But, as held in Jones vs. Robinson, Eng. , the delay of presentment for so great a lapse of time in this case, not explained or accounted for, amounted to gross negligence, and there being no question about this, as a matter of fact, the court below should have charged the jury what the legal conclusion was, viz : that the plaintiff had failed to use due diligence. No matter when the demand of payment was made, it was nugatory and unavailing to charge the assign- or without notice to him of the non-payment, and the case here stands as if there had been no presentment or demand of payment, until the day before the suit was brought, nearly two years-after the assignment by the defendant to Hough. Under the statute, where the bond, bill or note, is transferred' before due, the holder, by using due diligence, may hold liable all or any of the prior parties. But where the transfer is after due, we apprehend that it is each separate endorsement or assignment, that is equivalent to the drawing of a new bill, unless indeed,, all the transfers are made within the period of diligence, which the law would require at the hands of the first assignee; in. other words, an over due bond or note, cannot be transferred by various successive endorsements, at distant intervals of time, so as to subject all prior parties in one common liability to the last endorsee, as would be the case when negotiable paper, payable at a fixed time, is endorsed before due. Supposing it to be law, that if Hough, the first assignee, by a seasonable demand upon the maker for payment, and notice of non-payment to the defendant, his immediate assignor, had thus fixed his liability upon the contract of assignment, any subsequent assignment of the bond or note by Hough, would transfer that liability along with it as a chose in action to a remote assignee, yet it does not follow that the first assignee of a note, past due, having failed to fix the liability of his assignor by due presentment and notice of non-payment, can by an assignment of his own, confer any authority upon a second assignee, to revive or renew the conditional liability of the first assignor, which, by such neglect had become discharged. Under these circumstances, the plaintifi below, by a prompt demand of payment of the original maker, and notice of non-payment to Hough, his immediate assignor, might have held him equally liable with the maker or obligor, and this, we think, would be giving to the statute quite as liberal and beneficial construction as it is susceptible of: but without changing the whole character of the contract, the demand and notice to Hough would not make the defendant liable, unless due notice of demand and refusal had been given to him. What is due notice in such case would be ascertained by regarding him as the drawer of a sight draft upon the maker, and so any question of reasonable diligence on the part of the payee, or any holder of such draft, would be determined as at the law merchant! It does not seem necessary to notice any other errors, that might be considered as appearing on this record.

1862624,Dugan as ad. vs. Fowler,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1850-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the court. Dugan, as administrator, sued Fowler in debt on a forthcoming bond, executed to the plaintiff’s intestate by John H. Cocke, as principal, and William Cummins, and the defendant as his securities for the delivery of slaves seized in execution as the property of Cocke, to satisfy a judgment in favor of plaintiff’s intestate against said Cocke. The questions of law presented for our consideration arise upon the decision of the court below, sustaining the demurrer of the defendant to the plaintiff’s replications to defendant’s first plea. It is argued by the defendant that the legal sufficiency of the whole pleading is brought in review by the demurrer. This, as a general rule,is correct, but as the legal sufficiency of the declaration has already been decided, ( Eng. ,) that decision will be held conclusive upon that point. And as the counsel seem to differ widely as to the extent to which that decision will be held conclusive, it may be well to remark, that it is only conclusive as to the legal sufficiency of the declaration, as a pleading, to put the defendant to answer. But nothing is settled with regard to the extent or nature of the defence to be interposed. As regards that, the defendant is left just as if no demurrer had been interposed to the declaration. Whilst this is the case, as regards the issues of fact to be formed, no second consideration of the declaration will be permitted upon a demurrer to the subsequent pleadings. The demurrer to the replications does, however, raise the question as to the sufficiency of the plea to which they were offered as a reply. And, we will pi’oceed at once to consider the plea, because, if it should be found demurrable upon grounds not amendable, it will super-cede the necessity of considering the questions arising upon the demurrer' to the replications. The plea' is in bar and sets up a payment or satisfaction by a levy upon the slaves and real estate of Cocke, one of the defendants in the execution, in satisfaction of a statute j udgment, upon the same forthcoming bond, upon which this suit is brought: which levy is averred to be upon property of sufficient value to satisfy such judgment, and to remain in full force and undischarged. In support of this plea, it is contended that the bond was merged in the statute judgment; and that, as property of sufficient value to satisfy it, is taken and held in satisfaction, the debt is-thereby, in fact, satisfied, and a bar to any recovery upon the bond. The plaintiff’s counsel, on the other hand, deny that the1 levy is a satisfaction, such as can be plead in bar, or amounts to-more than an abatement or suspension of the right to further satisfaction, until the levy is legally discharged; and denies that the-bond is merged in the judgment, or by force of the statute loses-its efficacy as a bond. The solution of this latter question is involved in much difficulty. Upon the return of the execution unsatisfied, and the bond as-forfeited, the statute gave the right, at once, by operation of law,to sue out an execution against the principal and the.security in, the bond. No formal judgment is pronounced. In this instance it was done upon motion of the plaintiff and leave of court; but-still no formal judgment was rendered. It will not do to call the' bond the judgment. It is but the evidence of debt, which, together with the return of the officer thereon, upon which, when; brought into court, by mere force of the statute, there is, in contemplation of law, a judgment existing, though not formally pronounced, nor entered of record, yet so dependant upon the bond- and the return, as almost necessarily to livein them. For they are' the only record evidence, except the motion for execution and the-order granting it, of the existence of such judgment. In the case of Ruddell against Macgruder, Eng. , the nature of this statute judgment was considered with some care. In that case it was said, “The non-delivery of the property transforms the bond by operation of law into a statutory judgment, on which statutory judgment, execution may issue against all of the obligors in the bond. The execution does not issue upon the bond, but upon the statutory judgment, which, by operation of law, springs into being upon the forfeiture, and then exists in contemplation of law.” Adhering to this, as perhaps the best exposition which we can give, and which has been heretofore cited with approbation, we must hold that the judgment exists, not, properly speak ing, in the bond: that is the evidence of a debt, and together with the return, constitutes the foundation upon which the statute-judgment rests, and may also be considered the record evidence of its existence. Thus considered, when suit is brought upon the bond, it may be defended against, just as when brought upon any other instrument, upon wdiich there has been a recovery had. For there has been a recovery had upon this bond, and whether formally pronounced by the court,' and entered upon the record upon-a given state of .facts, or pronounced by the law upon another given state of facts, declared to be sufficient, it is still a recovery as full and as complete, in the one case as in the other, and is equally effective in procuring final satisfaction. We come next to consider the efficacy of the particular defence interposed in this case. Conceding the plea to be in all other respects sufficient and formal, we come at once to the main point. Is an existing unsatisfied levy upon property sufficient in value to satisfy the judgment, such satisfaction as maybe pleaded in bar of a recovery. We have repeatedly held that such a levy is a satisfaction, but not an absolute satisfaction in any event. It must depend upon circumstances connected with the future disposition of the levy, whether it is an absolute satisfaction or not. In the application of this rule, where the question ai;ises as to whether further process for satisfaction should be suspended until the subsisting levy is disposed of, as in the case of Whiting & Slark, and the more recent case of Trapnall vs. Waterman and Wood, there is comparatively but little difficulty. The question did not arise upon plea; nor is that the mode of reaching such irregularity. Those cases settle the general principle, that a subsisting undischarged levy upon property, sufficient to satisfy the judgment, is a satisfaction until, by the discharge of the levy by sale or otherwise, it proves to be partial or incomplete. In those cases the question arose upon the right of the judgment creditor to further process upon his judgment; here the question comes up by plea in bar to another action upon the same demand. A judgment upon this plea in favor of the defendant, would be a perpetual bar to all further satisfaction, whether the levy should or not, upon sale of the property or other legal discharge, prove to be sufficient: and as this would be the effect of the judgment on the plea, such plea cannot be allowed, for if allowed, the judgment of the court would go beyond the legal effect of the matter pleaded. In the case of Humphries vs. Anthony, where an undischarged levy was pleaded in bar of a right to revive the judgment, upon which the levy was made, the insufficiency of the plea was neither discussed nor decided. The demurrer was to the replication, and although in considering the legal sufficiency of the replication, this court might have gone back to consider of the sufficiency of the plea, yet this was not done. The decision of the court settled alone the question as to the sufficiency oí the replication. The decision in that case, therefore, is no authority for holding a plea in bar admissible in such cases, but must be limited to the precise point discussed and decided. In a later case, Fowler and Pike vs. Scott, where after dissolution of an injunction, and pending an appeal from the decision of the court dissolving it, suit was brought upon the injunction bond, the pendency of the appeal, was plead in bar to a recovery upon the bond, the court held that, although a plea in abatement would have been the more appropriate plea, yet the defence might be pleaded either in bar or abatement. This decision was made upon the authority of Bell vs. Chapman, John. Rep. , where a plea to the disability of the plaintiff, that he was an alien enemy, (a state of war then existing,) was held to be well pleaded in bar or abatement. But it will be observed that the subject matter of defence in the last case, was to the disability of the party to sue, and not matter in bar of the recovery as in this case. These decisions, therefore, admitting the law to have been correctly decided, under the particular state of the case presented, do not conflict with :our opinion in this case. We are satisfied that the defence set up in this plea cannot be plead in bar of the action; and whether the replications were sufficient in law or not, as the sufficiency of the plea was properly raised by the demurrer to the replications, the demurrer should have been overruled. As this defence, according to our view of the law, is entirely cut off, so that the question cannot again arise in the court below, it becomes unnecessary to discuss the merits of the replications. A bad replication is sufficient for a bad plea. Let the judgment be reversed and the case remanded to be proceeded in according to law and not inconsistent with this opinion. Watkins, C.

1862617,Beaver vs. Lewis et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. The complainant by his bill alleges that the defendants and himself entered into an agreement of co-partnership for the purpose of erecting a dam and saw mill, upon a certain tract- of land then belongiug to the government, but which was to be entered by them in tKeir joint names, each partner advancing his equal portion of the purchase money, All the partners were to aid in constructing the mill, and an account was to be kept of the work done, materials furnished, and money expended by each. The complainant being a mill-wright, was to do and superintend that portion of the work. That in case either partner should become dissatisfied by the time the mill was put into operation, or before, he should not then be considered a partner any longer, but should be paid what was due him by the concern. That the parties proceeded with the erection of the mill and dam, in which the complainant was engaged during several months, when he discovered that one of the defendants, with the privity of the other, had gone to the district land office, and claimed and obtained a pre-emption right to the tract of land on which the mill was situate, thereby preventing for the term of one year, the entry of it, pursuant to their agreement, and the defendants then refused to recognize him as a partner, and forced him to abandon the work. That besides his labor bestowed in assisting to erect the mill, he had expended various small sums of money of which an account was exhibited. That he was entitled as a partner, to one-third share in the mill, and prayed for discovery, and an account and settlement of the partnership affairs, that the property might be sold and the proceeds divided amongst the partners according as the amount due to each might be ascertained. The defendants, in their answer, profess to annex and setforth by way of exhibit, an account of the labor and money expended by them in erecting the mill, and also an account of moneys owing to them by the complainant, but no such exhibits appear in the transcript before us. But in order to reach what seems to be the only question presented in the case, it will be sufficient to state, that the answer and the depositions taken on both sides disclose substantially the following facts. That there was a verbal agreement to erect the mill and enter theland in partnership, though differing in several respects from that alleged by the complainant. That the complainant did expend some money, and work at intervals and indifferently well during several months. That the defendants lodged in the land office, a claim to a preemption right upon the tract in question, not with any design to defraud the complainant, but to prevent any other person from entering it, and until such time as the partners could spare the money to enter it, and that the transaction was so explained to the complainant. • That the complainant quit work and abandoned the partnership without any just cause for dissatisfaction and against the wishes of the defendants,, who requested him to continue. That the work done by the complainant was of some value to the defendants, who remained in possession of the property, and when the complainant left the mill in an unfinished state, hired another mill-wright and went on to complete it. Upon the hearing, the court below dismissed the bill for want of equity, and upon the whole case, the appellant has no right to complain of the decree, so far as it denies to him any right as a partner to an interest in the specific property. But it does appear that something is due to him from the defendants, or at least, that he is equitably entitled to have an account taken, and a decree in his favor, for what may be found to be justly due, and upon the statement of such account, both parties will be at liberty to make proof of their demands. The abandonment by the complainant of the undertaking worked a dissolution of the copartnership, but there was nothingin his conduct from which any fraudulent design to obtain an unfair advantage of his copartners, which would work a total forfeiture of his rights, can be inferred. He left them in possession of the partnership property, and the avails of his labor in an unfinished, but not useless state. Unlike the defendant in Harvey vs. Howell, Ark. , whose conduct the court then thought a fit subject for animadversion, the complainant here did not engage in any business hostile to the interests of the partnership, or do anything inconsistent with it beyond his capricious abandonment of the undertaking, which did not hinder them from prosecuting it to completion! The cause will be remanded with instructions to the court below to direct an account to be taken of the amount due to the complainant for his work and services, materials furnished or money expended about the erection of the dam and mill, supposing him to have been employed by the defendants for that purpose, and after deducting therefrom in the way of compensation such amount as he may have received from the defendants, to decree that they pay him the residue, if any, which he will take in lieu of any interest he might have had in the partnership property, or the profits arising from it.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862616,Dixon vs. Thatcher et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an action of replevin in the cepit for a slave. The* defendant pleaded non cepit; property in himself in right of his-wife, in right of his wife jointly with plaintiff, in right of his wife jointly with a third person, in right of his wife jointly with the-plaintiff and others, and also property in a third person; in each-of them traversing the plaintiff’s title. To each of these pleas the plaintiff filed two replications. In-his second replication-, without setting up an absolute title, or right of property, or possession in himself, he replied that he had title to the slave as one of the heirs of Laura Ann Bradshaw, an J. also, as one of the heirs of Sarah McGinnis, and also as legatee under the will of Sarah McGinnis, and that before and at the time when, &c., he was in peaceable possession of the slave, with the assent of Woodruff, the executor of said will. To these replications the defendants demurred, and the court,, upon consideration, sustained the demurrer, and this decision is-assigned as error and will be first considered. The several pleas, except the sixth plea, set up title in the de-fendant, or in the defendant jointly with others, and each con-eludes with a traverse of the plaintiff’s title to the property. The-injustice of the caption, which is the gist of the action, is by these-pleas avoided, b3r showing that the defendant had a right to take the property. » The material fact put in issue is property in the defendant, and consequently the replication must sustain the title, not the mere possessory title, but the absolute title. It is true that possession by the plaintiff and a wrongful taking by the defendant will entitle the plaintiff in the first instance to maintain his action, but when, as Baron Gilbert says, (Treatise on the law of Replevin ) the defendant pleads property in himself, he avoids the injustice of the caption, which is the gist of the action, by showing that he had a right to take it. To such plea the plaintiff replies, not merely a possessory title, unless connected with such facts as would show a right of dominion and control, even against him who has the legal title; but he must reply such facts as show title in himself. The case of Rogers vs. Arnold, Wend. Rep. , is very strongly in point. The action was replevin, for taking mill irons; pleas, non cepit, property in defendants and another; property in themselves as tenants in common with the plaintiff; property in themselves as tenants in common with the plaintiff and another; property in themselves; and property in one of them. When considering the effect of these pleas, the court said “ All these pleas are obviously founded upon the principle applicable to"" this action, that the plaintiff, as in trover, must recover upon the strength of his title to, or property in the goods in question.” And again, upon the same question, the court said “ It is a good plea in this action that the property is in the plaintiff and the defendant, or a stranger; and where there are two plaintiffs, it is in one of them. Here it is shown to be in the plaintiff and one of the defendants, which disproves the issues in the case, that the plaintiff is the exclusive owner. It is not material that the defendant should prove title to the property, as set forth in any one plea, as that is only inducement to the-traverse of the plaintiff’s title, as has been before shown, and need not be, and was not denied in the replication. Upon the issue the plaintiff was bound to prove and maintain an exclusive right to the possession and control of the property.” This decision is well sustained by numerous authorities, and from the principle laid down it follows, that as the plaintiff, under such issue, is bound to prove an exclusive right to possession and control, which can only exist where he has the absolute title and exclusive title to the property, or holds under one who has such title, he must, when he replies to such plea, set up matter which, if proven, would uphold and sustain his right to an exclusive right of possession and control of the property. This, we think, the replications fail to do. They neither assert an exclusive right of possession in the plaintiff, nor in one under whom he held possession, but assert a joint property in the slave as heir of certain individuals, and under the will of one of them as legatee, and that they had possession, with the assent of the executor of the will of one of the two, under whom plaintiff and defendants set up title. This clearly gave no right to an exclusive possession, because it only showed a joint tenancy, or a tenancy in common with others. Littleton says, “ If two be possessed of chattels personal in common by divers titles, as of a horse, or ox, or cow, if one takes the whole to himself, out of the possession of the other, the other hath no remedy, but to take this from him, who hath done him the wrong to occupy in common, &c., when he can see his time, &c.” And Lord Coke, commenting thereon, says, “ If one tenant in common take all the chattels personal, the other hath no remedy by action, but he may take them again. Co. Litt. a. And to this effect is the decision of the court in Rogers vs. Arnold, Wend. , and McElderry vs. Flannagan, Har. & Gill, . And this question was expressly decided in Robinson vs. Calloway, Ark. Rep. . The replications to the several pleas setting up property in the defendant, or in the defendant with others, were insufficient, and the demurrer to them correctly sustained. As regards the 6th plea, which sets up title in Woodruff, as executor of the will of Sarah McGinnis — if the plaintiff had replied a special property and right of possession under Woodruff, we are not prepared to say that such replication would not have been good; but we cannot consider the replication as relying upon a hire, or right of possession derived through any contract for a limited estate in the slave, but as showinghow he acquired possession under his title as heir and legatee; and consequently the replication to this plea was also insufficient, and the demui’rer to it properly sustained. The next question is as to the admissibility, as evidence, of a paper purporting to be a bill of sale to Sarah Bradshaw, for her children, Sarah and Laura, through whom the defendants claim title to the slave. The paper offered in evidence purported to be a copy of the record of a bill of sale to Sarah Bradshaw for her infant children, recorded in the office of the Parish Judge, and is certified by him as a true copy from the records in his office ; to which is appended the certificate of the Governor of Louisiana, that James J. Weems, who certified the copy, was, at the time of signing the same, Parish Judge, for the Parish of West Feliciana, in said State : that his signature is genuine, and that faith and credit are due to his official acts as such. The bill of sale purports to have been taken before Joseph Bernard, a notary public for the Parish of Feliciana, in said State, and was no otherwise proven or authenticated as the act of the parties. To the reading of this paper the plaintiff objected, and thereupon the defendant, as a foundation for reading said paper writing in evidence, and against the objection of the plaintiff, produced a pamphlet entitled “ Acts passed at the first session of the 14th Legislature of the State of Louisiana, begun and held in the city of New Orleans, January 7th, .” And for the same purpose, against the objection of the plaintiff, produced a book with a title page, as follows : “Civil Code of the State of Louisiana, with annotations by Wheelock S. Upton, L. L. D., and Neil R. Jennings. By authority. New Orleans. E. Johnson & Co. Stationers’Hall, .” Upon the production of this act and civil code, or that which purported to be the Civil Code of Louisiana, and under authority of the contents thereof, the court overruled the objection, both to the reading of the pamphlet acts and the civil code, and also to the admissibility of the paper purporting to be a copy of the record of said Parish court, and permitted the same to be read to the jury as evidence. By the 2d section, ch. , Dig. stat. p. , it is provided, “That the printed statute books of the several States and Territories of the United States, purporting to have been printed under the authority of such State or Territory, shall be evidence of the legislative acts of such States or Territories.” Under this statute we perceive no objection to the introduction of the act passed at the session of , on account of the evidences of its authenticity, as an act of the Louisiana legislature. But then it cannot be said to be authority for making the paper offered in evidence matter of record; because the act is prospective, and was passed some fifteen years or more after the date and record entry of the paper offered in evidence. Nor can the pamphlet offered as the civil code come in aid of this act; because it did not purport to be a statute book of the State of Louisiana, printed under the authority of that State, nor did it appear to have been adopted by any act of the Legislature of the State as a code of laws of the State. The act touching this civil code only authorized the Governor to purchase, for the use of the State, one thousand copies of a new edition of the civil code of Louisiana, proposed to be published by E. Johns & Go., provided that the Governor should be satisfied with the manner in which the Work should be done, and further, that said edition shall be carefully collated with the original manuscript, &c. Now there is no evidence whatever, that the pamphlet offered was one of Johns & Go’s», new edition of the civil code, or that it ever was examined, compared, or approved by the Governor, or that he was satisfied with the manner in which it was done. And even if all this had appeared, there is no provision in the act for adopting this as part of'the code of laws of the State of Louisiana, or of the laws heretofore existing. It simply provides for the purchase of a thousand copies for the use of the State. The court below erred, therefore, in permitting the pamphlet; purporting to be the civil code of Louisiana, to be read. Returning to the paper offered as a copy of the record, It is evL dent that it was inadmissible as evidence, because it was neither shown to be acknowledged before any officer competent to take such acknowledgment, and was spread upon the record of the Parish court without authority of law. In the case of Wilson vs. Royston, Ark. , the authentication of the deed by acknowledgement before a notary public, with certificate, as well as that of the Governor of the State, showing that the notary was duly commissioned, &c.; was held insufficient evidence to authorize the reading of the deed in evidence in this State. We think, under the circuinstances of the case, that the court below erred in permitting the paper, purporting to be a bill of sale, and tending in connection with other evidence to prove title in the defendant, or third persons, to be read in evidence to the jury. And for this error the judgment and decision of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings therein, to be had according to law, and not inconsistent with this opinion.

1862699,Refeld et al. Exs. vs. Bellette et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court., This is an action of replevin brought by the appellees against the appellants, for the wrongful taking of slaves. The defendants filed two pleas, non cepit and property in themselves, as the executors of the last will and testament of Frederick Notrebe, deceased. By written consent and agreement, an agreed statement of the facts was submitted to the court as a special verdict. The facts or special verdict is substantially this: John Baptiste Bellette and his wife, Elizabeth Bellette resided with, or in the immediate vicinity of Frederick Notrebe, (who had married their daughter,) for twenty-five years, and during that time, and prior to the 17th of July, , the said John Baptiste had rendered services to said Frederick, in the management of his business. In consideration of which and one dollar, on the day last aforesaid, the said Frederick, by deed in fee simple, conveyed to the said John Baptiste, two lots of land in the village of Arkansas. And at the same time, by a separate deed, for the same consideration, he granted, bargained, and sold to the said John Baptiste, five negro slaves, who with their incréase, are the slaves now in suit, as his absolute property and estate- And on the same day, said Notrebe also executed to the said Bellette’the following instrument, to wit: “Know all men by these presents, that I, Frederick Notrebe, of the Post of Arkansas, Territory and county of Arkansas, declare to whom it may concern, that my father-in-law, John B. Bellette (alias Enselma) rendered me services years, and by his care, economy and continued assiduity to protect my interests, has been an additional hand to help me in accumulating and saving some property. And in consequence a remuneration from me to him, is only just and equitable, and without any cause whatever prejudicial to my children, I am willing, and by these presents, do will that my said father-in-law be independent in his old age from the caprice of my said children, and for these reasons alone, (not including many others of some weight) and in case I die before him, as God and Providence best knows, I wish and intend, that he shall take out of my estate, before any dividend be made by my children, or their representatives, the sum of three thousand dollars, in lawful money, or the equivalent in property at a fair valuation, at his option; and I absolutely will and order that my heirs, executors, or administrators shall truly and honestly execute this act, as a legitimate compensation due to the said J. B. Bellette, the father of my dear and beloved wife, Felicite. I also wish and intend, that should my mother-in-law, Elizabeth Bellette, do service to my said father-in-law and myself, then, that she will receive the legal interest of the said donation of $,, for her lifetime, and request my children to add any surplus, (if they are able) to give her a full competency, and to render her happy. The house and the slaves given to my father-in-law, by two instruments of wi'iting, bearing the same date as this one, will be also her property for life, and shall have and keep possession, to enjoy.it as her own property.” These three instruments were duty executed and delivered to the said Bellette, in whose hands they remained until his death; until which time the female slaves continued in his possession and exclusivé use, and the males also, or others in their place. Notrebe, during the lifetime of Bellette, set up no claim to the slaves, but on the contrary, admitted the title to be in Bellette, by offering to buy or swap for one of them. He did, however, pay taxes on them in his own name. The families (Notrebe and Bellette’s) lived pretty much as one family, though occupying different buildings. Notrebe furnished provisions for both. Bellette died in possession of the slaves in . After his death Mrs. Bellette occupied a room in the same house with Notrebe as a member of his family. In or Notrebe denied Mrs. Bellette’s right to the property. In he made his will, the tenth article of which is as follows: “Having already given as a gift by a deed, and a bill of sale under date of July the 17th, , some property and slaves to the late John B. Bellette, (alias Enselma) my father-in-law, which has not been expended by him in his lifetime, the same property is to be revertible as a life estate to his widow, Elizabeth Bellette, my mother-in-law, and having also secured to the said late John B. Bellette deceased, by an instrument of writing, under date July 17th, , a sum of three thousand dollars in property, at fair valuation, to be received from my estate after my decease, if in need of it, now the same clause is also in favor of, and revertible to the said Elizabeth Bellette, my mother-in-law, and my absolute will and desire are, that this promise be effected after my decease, if she is in want, and to be fulfilled to the last point. And I recommend my beloved wife, and my two heirs, John and Mary, to continue to cherish her in her old age, and to treat her well in procuring my mother-in-law as good a maintainance as circumstances will enable my wife and two heirs, John and Mary, for their good old mother and grandmother.” In , Notrebe died, leaving his wife and mother-in-law, the plaintiffs in this suit, who under the facts above, claim jointly the slaves in controversy. The defendants on the other hand, claim the slaves as the executors of the last will of Mr. Notrebe. The court below upon the agreed facts, or special verdict declared the law to be in favor of the plaintiffs and rendered judgment accordingly. From which decision, under the special reservation of exception in the submission of the facts to the court, the defendant excepted, and by appeal has brought the-case before us for decision. There is in this case no question as to facts, they having been ascertained and agreed upon, and we are called upon to declare the law which arises upon them. At the outset it is contended by the appellant, that the three first instruments bearing the same date and made touching the same subject matter, should be taken as one instrument; and that as the latter was testamentary in its character, the others must follow it, and thereby they should all be so considered. It is true that these several instruments werebetween the same parties, and were evidently intended for atwo-fold common purpose: to provide means for the present comfort and independent support of an aged relative, and also, in case of contingency to provide for further support after the death of the obligor or donor. The present wants of Mr. Bellette were supplied by an absolute deed for a house, and slaves to wait upon and work for him. The first two instruments, absolute and unconditional, effected this; and although there is manifested throughout a praiseworthy solicitude on the part of Mr. Notrebe to provide for his father-in-law, above all care for remuneration, still it is expressly admitted by him, and we must so consider it, that these instruments were made upon a full and valuable consideration. They are neither gifts nor legacies, but deeds of sale upon valuable consideration, not to take effect at a future day, but instantly, and which, in this instance, was followed up by the actual possession and enjoyment of the property. Mr. Notrebe admitted the property to be Mr. Billette’s until after his death, and after that time, as we shall presently see, he might well have asserted claim to the property. The third instrument, it is true, relates to the same subject matter, and although that too, is acknowledged to be upon full consideration, and only what is due, it is made to depend upon two contingencies; first, the death of Mr.- Notrebe, and secondly, the pecuniary circumstances of Mr. Bellette. Admitting the testamentary character of this instrument in several leading particulars, we are not of opinion it can draw to it the other two instruments and defeat their obvious intent and legal effect. If we were permitted to consider these as voluntary gifts, without other consideration than the respect and regard of Mr. Notrebe for his father-in-law, and a sense of duty to provide for him the means of support, after he, by his death, should be no longer permitted to do so, then the argument of counsel and authorities cited, to which we have given attentive consideration, would have their full force and application, but these instruments evidenced a sale of property to pay a debt, a debt admitted by Mr. Notrebe, and therefore conclusive upon him. By the force and effect of each of them, a perfect title vested in Mr. Bellette, which no subsequent act of Mr. Notrebe could defeat. If the effect of the third instrument, as contended for, is to constitute these three instruments one, and to make them all testamentary, then Mr. Notrebe would have had an unquestionable right to revoke them at pleasure during his life. But surely it cannot be contended that a bill of sale vesting an absolute title in slaves, upon full and valuable consideration could, after its execution, be revoked; and yet such must be the consequence, if the argument of counsel be correct. The very nature of these instruments forbids that they should be considered testamentary. In the case of Habergham vs. Vincent, Ves. Jr. , the deed was executed after the will, made in reference to it, and could only exist in it: whatever title passed was in reference to the will. Here the bill of sale was at the same date, upon full consideration, and could well exist and take effect without reference to the third instrument. We are satisfied that the slaves passed to Mr. Bellette, and were held by him as his absolute property, and at his death, became the property of Mr. Notrebe, by virtue of his marriage with the daughter and sole heir of Mr. Bellette, subject to the dower interest of his wife, Mrs. Elizabeth Bellette. At the death of Mr. Notrebe, under the provisions of the tenth article of his will, Mr. Bellette acquired a life estate in the slaves. Of course, as Mr. Notrebe held them subject to her dower interest, he could only convey by will such interest as he had, which when taken in connection with her dower interest vested in her an absolute estate for life. We have not overlooked the statute, sec. , Dig. ch. , which exempts property acquired by the widow from sale,to pay debts, &c., but that statute could not in our opinion affect the right of the husband to sell or devise the estate. This being our conclusion, it follows, that Mrs. Notrebe has no present interest or estate in the slaves and was improperly made a party plaintiff in the suit. Mrs. Bellette’s right as devisee vested at the death of Mr. Notrebe, but the question is, can she assert such right by action at law against the executor. We should think not; at least until the debts are paid, or time allow'ed for paying them, because she takes her title under the will, subject to the payment of debts, and the estate passes into the hands of the executor in the first place to satisfy debts. Upon this point we have been referred to several authorities, which we think quite satisfactory. Andrews vs. Hunneman. Pick. Rep. . Toller's Ex. . Lynch vs. Thomas, Leigh , settle the question as to the right of the executor to hold the property in the first instance for the payment of debts. The right of the legatee to his legacy is suspended, until by the assent of the executor or the lapse of time, for the settlement of the estate, this suspension is removed. Thus in Mississippi, where A. bequeathed a slave to B., which was in B’s possession at the testator’s death, it was held that the executor might recover hire for the period of one year after the grant of letters testamentary, he having until that time to examine into and settle the estate. King vs. Cooper, Walker's Miss. Rep. . Replevin is a possessory action, and the plaintiff, in order to maintain it, must have at the commencement of his suit, a right to the possession. Under the circumstances of this case, it is consistent with the rights of the parties and the evidence, to suppose that the slaves w'ere, at the time of Mr. Notrebe’s death, in. the possession of either Mrs. Bellette or himself. They both lived together; the slaves had been up to the death of Mr. Bellette, in his possession, and after his death became by operation of law, the joint property of Mr. Notrebe as heir, in right of his wife, and of Mrs. Bellette as the widow entitled to dower. If, after the death of Mr. Notrebe, she retained and possesed herself of the slaves, and the estate of Mr. Notrebe was clearly sufficient to pay his debts without drawing upon specific legacies, then slight circumstances might be sufficient from which to infer assent; such as continued acquiescence by the executor in her possession, after time had been allowed to examine into the condition of the estate. How this was, the facts as agreed upon do not show. In view, therefore, of the whole case, without undertaking to say, from the facts before us, whether Mrs. Bellette might or not have maintained her action in replevin for the recovery of the slaves in her own right, it is very clear that no action could be maintained by Mrs. Bellette and Mrs. Notrebe jointly, because, as we have seen, Mrs. Notrebe had neither title nor right of possession to the slaves. The court below therefore erred in deciding the question of law arising upon the agreed facts or special verdict, in favor of the right of the plaintiffs jointly to maintain their action, and in rendering judgment thereon for the plaintiffs.

1862618,The State Bank vs. Fowler and Pike,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the court. This suit was commenced on the 6th day of September, , on a promissory note made by the defendants, together with Thomas J. Lacy, and G. N. Causin, dated 24th February, , and payable to the plain tiff one year after date. It will be necessary to state only so much of the pleadings and evidence as will show distinctly the questions presented on the record. The defendants severally, pleaded that the cause of action had not accrued within three years next before the commencement of the suit. The plaintiff replied that on the 23d day of September, , Lacy, the principal debtor, made a partial payment upon the note to the plaintiff, and on the 26th day of February, , and within three years from the time of such payment, the plaintiff commenced suit in tlie Pulaski Circuit Court, upon the note, against all the makers, the alias summons, issued in which suit, was served upon the present defendants, and not served upon the other defendants, Lacy and Causin, who had departed this life; and in the progress of that suit, the defendant, Fowler, having filed his plea in abatement of the alias writ of summons, the plaintiff demurred to the plea, and the demurrer being submitted the court, there, on the 23d day of June, , overruled the demurrer, and Hie plaintiff declining to reply to said plea, and electing to rest on her said demurrer, the court then and there adjudged that the defendants go hence without day, and recover of the plaintiff their costs in that behalf expended, as would appear by the-record, &c., and that afterwards, on the Cth day of September, , and within one year after the said last mentioned judgment, the plaintiff commenced the present suit against these defendants. To this replication the defendants severally demurred, because5 it did not appear that the plaintiff had suffered a non suit in the5 former action, so as to bring her within the saving clause of the5 statute. These demurrers being overruled, the defendant, Pike,, rested; and Fowler rejoined, 1st, denying the fact of part payment by Lacy ; 2d, that there was no such record of the former suit as alleged in the replication. Upon the trial of the issues to Fowler’s rejoinders, it appeared; to the court that there was such a record. But, in-order to prove5 the fact of the part payment by Lacy, the Bank offerred in evidence her books, kept at the time by A. E. Thornton, her Financial Receiver, or Cashier, in liquidation, proving in connection therewith, that Thornton was such receiver on the 2d of September, , and had the charge and custody pf the books, records,, accounts and notes of the Bank: that he had left Arkansas after the institution of the present suit, and about a year previous to the trial; that he had gone to parts unknown, and that since his departure, he had been and was beyond the process and jurisdiction of this court. The books of the Bank showed the part payment by Lacy, at the time alleged in the replication, the entry being as proved, in the hand-writing of Thornton in the blotter, and posted by him into the ledger. The court below excluded the Bank books and the proofs offered in connection therewith, as being incompetent evidence.to prove the partial payment alleged to have been made by Lacy, and judgment went against the Bank, to reverse which she prosecutes this writ of error. In the case of the State Bank vs. Magness, Eng. , the plaintiff replied to the plea of the statute, that in a former action for the same cause, she was non-suit and sued again within the year; and the record offered in support of this replication showed a judgment dismissing the suit, because the plaintiff, being-ruled to file a bond for cost, failed to do so. The court there held that the dismissal was, in effect a non-suit, and within the perview of the saving clause in the statute, and we are satisfied of the correctness of the decision upon the facts of that case. But the opinion there would seem to go to the length of holding, that wherever the plaintiff is not precluded by a decision upon the merits from bringing another action, he comes within the meaning of the exception in the statute for limiting actions, and may bring a new suit within a year. It is universally true, wherever it can be shown, according to the rules of law, that the merits of a suit have not been passed upon or determined, the plaintiff is not estopped by the adjudication, but may have a fresh action. This principle does not determine the plaintiff’s right to suspend or avoid the bar of the statute by suing again within the year, because that would be giving an effect to the term “non-suit,” not warranted by any adjudged cases, and which the statute could not have contemplated. So, on the other hand, it is true, that in order for a plaintiff to have the benefit of this saving in the statute, it is not necessary that there should be a formal or technical judgment of non-suit. The plaintiff may discontinue as to a part of the defendants, or he may suffer a discontinuance of the action as to all, or he may dismiss, or submit to a dismissal of his suit. But in all such cases, wherever the proceeding of the court is equivalent to a non-suit, for the purpose of extending the time for bringing a fresh action, the idea is, that the plaintiff goes out of court voluntarily, or submits to the order of the court requiring him to do so; and the court does not adjudicate the cause, so that there is no final judgment to which a writ of error will lie, because the party cannot reverse a proceeding which he has sought or acquiesced in. In this State, the non-suit, or a dismissal, or discontinuance, ■ which is equivalent to it, must of necessity, be voluntary. It is settled here—see Martin and Van Horn vs Webb, Ark. , ever since adhered to — that the plaintiff cannot, upon any advice or interposition of the court, be compelled to take a non-suit: but he has the right to insist that the court shall proceed with his cause, and adjudicate it for or against him, and for no other conceivable object than to have final judgment given, to which he may prosecute his writ of error, if he choose to complain of the proceedings. In the case now under consideration, the plaintiff, when her demurrer to the plea in abatement of the writ in the former suit was overruled, had the right to reply to the plea, if she thought proper to test the truth of it, or submitting to the demurrer to have sued out an alias writ, and so kept the same suit continuously on foot—see King vs. The State Bank, at January term, — or taken a non-suit, and according to the reason of the statute, a voluntary dismissal of the action would have the same effect, in order to enable her to sue again within the year. But when she elected to rest on her demurrer and proceed no further, and so force the court to render final judgment in favor of the defendants, it was an election on her part not to suffer a non-suit, but to take the chances of a reversal on error. A party thus situated, might not, indeed, prosecute his writ of error, but rather choose to bring a new action, which he could well do, because not precluded by any adjudication upon the merits. But the adjudication in question would not, for that reason, be any the less final, and we could not hold it to be a judgment of non-suit, without, at the same time, holding that a writ of error would lie to a judgment of non-suit. Upon the principle contended for by the plaintiff in error, wherever a plaintiff declines to amend, and final judgment goes upon demurrer sustained to the declaration, he would come within the saving of the statute, as if having suffered a non-suit, because there was no such judgment as precluded another action, if rightly brought for the same cause. We conclude therefore that there is no error in the judgment here, because the replication and the record offered in proof of it, fail to show such a judgment of non-suit as would avoid the bar set up in the plea. It was, moreover, necessary for tbe plaintiff, in order to avoid tbe bar, to couple the payment alleged to have been made by Lacy, with the former suit. Even if the court below erred in rejecting the evidence offered to prove this payment, the judgment would nevertheless, upon the whole record, have to be affirmed. But as to the proof of part payment no substantial difference is perceived between this case and The State Bank vs. Barber et al. Eng. , and no good reason is shown why the decision there ought not to he followed. The judgment is affirmed.",legal_case,negative,negative,positive,neutral
1862691,"Yell, Governor, use Covant & Co. vs. Outlaw et al.","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. The appellant, who was the plaintiff below, moves for leave to dismiss his appeal after the submission of the cause in this court. No recognizance for stay of execution wasentered into in the court below. It follows from the decision in Clay vs. Notrebe, Eng. , that the right of appeal given in common law cases* is a cumulative remedy to that by prosecuting a writ of error* both identical in their operation and design for the correction of errors. Reed vs. Latham, Ark. , State Bank vs. Conway, at January term, . So, the practice has been to treat the privilege of obtaining an order, allowing an appeal in chancery causes, by application to ,the Supreme Court, or one of the judges, within a year from the rendition of the decree, as cumulative to the right to have an appeal granted in the court below, during the term at which the decree was rendered. So that a party praying an appeal in the court below, but failing to prosecute it, may yet sue error at any time within three years, in a common law case, or obtain an appeal in a chancery cause, when reasonable grounds for its allowance appear, by application within the year to the Supreme Court. Where recognizance has been entered into to stay execution, the appellant or plaintiff in error, dismissing his suit, would subject himself to an affirmance by the opposite party, on production of a transcript, as provided by the statute, or to an action on the recognizance. And where there has been a recognizance* this court, after it has obtained control of the cause, might well refuse to allow a dismissal of it in all cases where, in its discretion, damages ought to be imposed upon affirmance; because if the appeal taken in the court below appear to have been for delay, the appellant will not be allowed to escape the consequen* ces, after having received the benefit of the delay. But giving the statute that construction which would make it most beneficial, where the execution of the judgment has not been suspended or superseded, no reason short of a manifest design to vex and harrass the opposite party, ought .to deprive the appellant, or plaintiff in error, of what we conceive to be his right, to dismiss, at his own costs, his appeal or writ of error; and which he may renew at any time within the period limiting the right to bring error.

1862735,Newton et al. vs. More,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court.- More, the plaintiff below, brought his action of covenant against-Pike and Newton, upon an obligation executed by them, on the 1st of April, , the material portion of which is as follows:’ “Whereas Elijah A. More and Absalom Fowler, Esqs., have this day mutually executed an instrument of compromise to settle certain claims, dues and demands, in favor of said More, wherefor,we Albert Pike and Thomas W. Newton,together with Charles P. Bertrand and John R. Desha, are securities of said Fowler, the stipulations of which compromise being complied with by said Fowler, by or on thp first day of May next, said claims and demands will be fully settled, and we and said two securities discharged; and on failure, decree will be entered in accordance with the prayer of the bill of said More, now pending in Pulaski Circuit Court. Now we pledge ourselves to said More and covenant, and agree,, that in case said Fowler complies with said stipulations, and we are so released, we, and said other securities, will pay such fee as Ringo and Trapnall may charge said More for their services in prosecuting said bill.” The declaration avers that-on the 1st day of May, , said Fowler did, according to its stipulations, comply with the terms of said compromise agreement, and the said defendants with their co-securities, were thereby released from their liability as such securities for said Fowler, to the plaintiff, whereby according to their said covenant with the plaintiff, the defendants became and are liable to pay the fee of said Ringo and Trapnall for prosecuting said bill, to wit, the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars, with breach that the defendants, although often requested, &c., had not paid the same. The defendants demurred to the declaration, because it did not allege that they knew of Fowler’s compliance with the compromise agreement; or that they had notice of the amount of the fee, or that any demand was made upon them to pay it. The demurrer being overruled, Newton pleaded, 1st, that Fowler did not, on the first day of May next after the date of the covenant, comply with the stipulations of the compromise agreement, and the securities were not released from the debts of his referred to: •2d, that Ringo and Trapnall did not charge the plaintiff any fee whatever, and were not entitled to any in the cause mentioned. Demurrer was sustained to the second plea, and the plaintiff replied to the ih’st plea, by way of estoppel, in si.bstance, that the defendant ought not to be admitted to plead the same, &c., because in the progress of the suit referred to, in the Pulaski Circuit Court, in which the plaintiff was complainant, and Fowler and his said securities were defendants, to enforce the payment of the same debts and demands, which were the subject of the compromise agreement, and to which the covenant here sued upon had reference, on the 8th of May, , the same came on to be heard on bill, answers, exhibits and the agreements, and admissions of both the complainant and the defendants in open court made, and it being admitted that Fowler did, on the 1st of May, , pay the sum of money required, thereby complying' with the compromise agreement in the covenant mentioned, it was, by the court there, among other things, decreed that the defendants, Newton and Pike, together with the other securities,. Bertrand and Desha, be forever released and discharged from all responsibility to the plaintiff, as the securities of Fowler, in respect of the debts and demands in question. Newton’s demurrer to the replication was overruled, and the defendant’s declining to plead further, the plaintiff had judgment, and for his damages assessed upon enquiry. Our opinion is, that upon all the points, the law is with the plaintiff in the court below. The object of the agreement of compromise was the release of Fowler and his securities: connected with that agreement was the covenant of the securities, that in case Fowler complied with the terms of the compromise, so as to release them, they would pay such fee as the complainant’s solicitors might charge him for their services in prosecuting the suit then pending, to enforce payment of the liabilities from which they were to be released. Clearly, the defendants were bound to take notice whether Fowler complied with the terms of the compromise, so as to perfect it. Nor do we think they were entitled to be notified of the amount of the fee, which the complain-, ant’s solicitors charged; because they took upon themselves the obligation to pay it, and the means of ascertaining the amount were not peculiarly within the knowledge or control of the plains tiff, but was to be ascertained from the solicitors, a source of information equally accessible to both parties. As they did not choose to stipulate for the amount, they stood in no worse com dition than the piaintff himself, who was liable without any spe-, cial request, and were bound to pay such reasonable fee as the solicitors deserved to have, such as they might agree to take, or had a right to charge. The second plea of Newton is bad, because in the face of the covenant he could not deny that the solicitors were entitled to any fee. If, by the allegation that they did not charge any fee, is meant that they forgave or relinquished it, for aught that. appears, it would he & nuclurn pactum, which would not prevent them from recovering the amount from the plaintiff, their client. No defence of this kind would bar the action, short of an averment of such acquittance or release from them as would protect the plaintiff against their rightful demand upon him for a fee. No good reason is perceived why the matter set up in the replication to the first plea is not sufficient to estop the defendant from claiming to avoid his covenant for the want of a literal and punctual compliance by Fowler with the stipulations of the compromise. The admissions of record by the parties to the chancery suit, and upon which the decree was predicated, secured to them the benefit of the release from the debts and liabilities of Fowler, which his delay' in complying with the terms of compromise had forfeited. Having accepted the benefit to which the decree restored them, as if there had been a compliance to the day, they ought not to be heard to deny the fact of such compliance. In the strictest sense the estoppel was mutual, becaifse', against the decree, More never could aver that there had been no compliance so as to set aside the agreement of compromise and charge the securities with the payment of the debts.

1862719,Jones et al. vs. State use of Pope County,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. This is an action upon a collector’s bond, brought against the sheriff and ex-officio assessor and collector of taxes of Pope county, and his securities. After setting out the bond and condition the breach assigned is, “that the said John W. Jones did not well and truly collect and pay over the said sum of thirteen hundred and seventeen dollars and seventy-seven cents so ordered to be levied for the purposes of revenue of the said county of Pope,” whereby the said writing became and is forfeited, &c. The endorsement on the writ would show a regular service on the defendants, but it does not appear to be signed by the sheriff. For this apparent diminution a writ of certiorari would be awarded ex-officio, if necessary in order to affirm. The entry of the judgment is quite inartificial, leaving it doubtful whether the defendants appeared, so far as-to waive the necessity of a jury to enquire into the truth'of the breaches, and assess the damages, and consent that they should be assessed by the court sitting as a jury, though that seems to be the purport of the entry. And so, presuming everything possible in favor of the court below, it might be gathered from the whole entry, that the court below ascertaining the defalcation of the collector to be $ , and the penalty accrued upon it, tobe $, intended to give judgment for the penalty of the bond, and that execution be awarded for the amount of the damages assessed, together with the accruing forfeiture of five per cent, per month upon the amount of the original defalcation from the rendition of the j udgment until the same should be paid and satisfied with costs, &c. But waiving the consideration of those matters assigned for error, the judgment will have to be reversed upon the third assignment which questions the sufficiency of the declaration. Upon the principle adjudged by this court in the case of Outlaw vs. The Governor, Ark., , relating to the mode of ascertaining and fixing the liability of the principal and securities upon an administration bond, it was necessary for the declaration in this case to contain an averment, either that the collector had settled with the county court and failed to pay over the amount due, Dig. Title, Revenue or Counties, secs. and , or that he failed to settle, and that the county court proceeded to adjust his accounts, and finally proceeded to render judgment against him, for the amount due, with the penalty added thereto, and fifty per centum per annum thereon, ib. sec. , et seq. Carnall vs. Crawford county, Eng. . Trice vs. Crittenden co., Eng. . The county court is the forum where the liability of the collector, upon which that of his securities depends, is to be ascertained and evidenced by its records. An adjudication in that forum is conclusive evidence against the securities, as well as the collector, in an action upon his bond in the Circuit Court. There can be no liability upon the collector’s bond without such adjucation unless the Circuit Court can, in an action upon the bond draw to itself, in a collateral way, a jurisdiction to investigate and settle the accounts of delinquent officers for the collection of revenue, which appropriately belongs to the county courts. The judgment will be reversed, and the cause remanded to the court below, with leave to be further proceeded in, if the plaintiff' shall file an amended declaration within such time as may be allowed by rule of that court, the defendants being considered as having due notice of the pendency of the suit.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862724,Witt et al. vs. The State,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court! By an act for the relief of the securities of John Hickey, sheriff of Pope county, approved January 11th, , they were allowed until the first day of November, thereafter, to pay the amount pf his defalcation as collector of the State and county revenue, for the year , and released from all forfeitures and penalties incurred, provided, they would give bond with security, to be approved by the county judge, in vacation, for the payment of the same and with interest upon the revenue due the State. Availing themselves of this act, they executed the bond upon which this suit was brought. The bond is made payable to the State for the penal sum of $,. And, after reciting that the principals had become security for Ilickey, as collector, that he had made default, &c., that there remained due and unpaid, from him, on account of State revenue the sum of $ , and for county revenue,the sum of $' , and the act passed for their relief, it was conditioned to be void, if the principals should well and truly pay into the State treasury, and into .the county treasury, respectively, the sums above specified, with interest, on or before the first day of November thereafter. No doubt exists as to the liability of these parties, and no useful end would be attained by a statement of the defence sought to be interposed by one of them. The only question arising upon the record which requires to be noticed is one of pi’actice. Demurrer being sustained to the plea interposed by one of the defendants, and he saying nothing further, and the others making default, the cpurt assessed the damages and gave judgment for the.dpbt really due, and interest, as in other cases, where the demand is ascertained by the instrument upon which the suit is founded. Digest, title, Practice at Law, sec. . It is argued for the plaintiff in error, that this proceeding is erroneous, and we are cited to the cases of Phillips vs. The Governor, Ark. . Adams vs. The State, Eng. . Outlaw vs. The Governor, ib. . Nelson vs. Hubbard, ib. . and McLain vs. Taylor, ib. . In all these cases the bonds sued upon were conditioned for the performance of some act other than the payment of money, being either upon delivery bonds or official l)onds; and tho.ugh we think, that in some of those cases the court, have adhered to the language of the statute, perhaps with unnecessary strictness, for reasons which might be given, yet we are not required now to go into an examination of them. The statute, Digest, title, Penal Bonds, provides for three distinct classes of cases, and the mode of proceeding in each is differently regulated. The first four sections relate to actions founded on bonds conditioned for the payment of a less sum of money. The sections from five to fifteen, apply to suits on bonds for the breach of any condition other than for the payment of money. Sections fifteen et seq. regulate the mode of proceeding in suits on official bonds ; including those of administrators, guardians, &c. It is only in the last two classes of cases, where the judgment is by default, or on demurrer, that a jury must be called, unless waived, to enquire into the truth of the breaches assigned, and assess the damages, and when, as decided by the cases referred to, such should be the form of the oath administered to the jury, in compliance with the statute. But upon the reading of the statute those provisions have no application to actions on bonds, conditioned for the payment of a less sum, and where the amount due is ascertained, or ascertainable by computation from the face of the instrument itself, as is the case here. In all such cases the penalty is inserted rather as an adherence to ancient form, and not because it is an essential part of the contract; and while no good reason can be imagined for the intervention of a jury to assess the damages, the statute is not so unreasonable as to require it.

1862727,The State Bank vs. McClelland,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the court. In this case the defendant pleaded the statute of limitation, to which the plaintiff filed five replications : each admitting that more than three years had elapsed between the time her cause of action accrued, and the commencement of the suit; and relying upon the provisions of the 24th sect. Dig. ch. , which provides that where an action is commenced before the cause of action is barred by limitation, and a non-suit is suffered, that such plaintiff may commence a new action within twelve months after such non-suit suffered, &c. The first and second of these replications no where aver against whom the first, or the several succeeding suits, after non-suit, were commenced; and although the third replication properly describes the cause of action and the parties in the first suit, and that a non-suit was suffered, it wholly fails to show against whom the second suit was commenced. The fourth replication was withdrawn ; the fifth replication avers that after the first non-suit, the plaintiff commenced her action anew, “ with intent to implead the plaintiff, J. W. Wilson and Thadeus C. Wilson.” Conceding this to be a clerical misprision, and that the pleader intended to say “defendant,” instead of “ plaintiff,” and the averment was in fact, that she intended to implead the defendant, J. W. Wilson and Thadeus C. Wilson, or the defendant, and the others, still the averment is insufficient. It is not enough to say that the plaintiff intended to sue, but there must be a direct averment that she did sue, &c. Each of these objections is fatal under the decision of this court in the case of The Bank vs. Sherrill, Eng. . The replications were therefore defective, and the demurrer to them properly sustained.

1862654,McLaughlin vs. Sproul,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. Sproul brought debt against McLaughlin, in the Clark Circuit Court, upon a bond for five hundred dollars, reciting that the latter had sold the former a certain tract of land described, and conditioned to be void if the obligor should make to the obligee, or cause it to be made, a valid title, in fee simple to the land in question, whenever the same should be subject to entry in the proper land office — breach, that long after the land was subject to entry, according to the intent and meaning of the bond, to wit, on &c., the plaintiff specially requested and required the defendant to execute and deliver to him a good and valid deed of conveyance for the same, which the defendant wholly neglected and refused. A demurrer to the declaration was overruled, and the defendant saying nothing further, and electing to stand on his demurrer, the court rendered judgment against him for the amount of the bond and costs, and awarded execution therefor., but no damages were assessed. We think the breach was well assigned in the second count, as we have substantially set it out. And under the received rule in this country, that the recitals in a deed are prima facie evidence of the payment of the purchase money, the same presumption of like payment arises from the face of this bond with collateral condition. And as there was no mutual or concurrent covenant, making it the duty of the plaintiff to do any other thing, besides making a reasonable demand for the conveyance, as a pre-requisite for his action, we think the demurrer was properly overruled. But before rendering a final judgment the court ought to have caused the plaintiff’s damages to be assessed under the provisions of the statute, in accordance with the previous decisions of this court, and for this error the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded to be proceeded with in this wise.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral

1862673,"Bailey, adm'r. vs. Gatton","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr.' Justice Walker delivered the opinion-of-the Court.- On the second day of June,-, the plaintiff filed in the office of a justice of the peace, the following instrument:- “White county, March 3d, . Twelve months after date, we promise jointly and severally to pay to Abner Bailey, administrator of Elijah Bailey, deceased, or order, forty-five dollars and twelve and a half cents, for value received, with interest at ten per cent, per annum, after maturity. Witness our hands and seals. JOHN L. GATTON, [l.s.] ‘ JOHN M. CLARK, [l.s.] AUGUSTUS GATTON, [l.s.]” Upon which instrument so filed the justice issued a summons requiring the defendants to appear before him to answer the complaint of Abner Bailey, administrator of the estate of Elijah Bailey, deceased, on a note of hand. The case was brought by appeal from the justice’s court, to the Circuit Court, and upon the trial de novo, the defendant, Gatton, pleaded, ne ungues administrator, to which issue was taken, and the case was submitted to a jury for trial; when upon motion of the defendant, the writing obligatory was excluded as evidence from the jury, because of an alleged variance between the instrument offered, and that described in the summons, and to which the defendant was called upon to defend. The court sustained the motion to exclude the writing obligatory from the jury as evidence, and thereupon a judgment was rendered for the defendant, from which the plaintiff has appealed to this court. The plea of ne ungues administrator tendered an immaterial issue, because the writing obligatory was executed to the plaintiff, and the suit brought upon it was in his own name individually, and not as administrator. The words “administrator, &c.,” were words of personal description, and the plaintiff might well elect to treat them as such, or .he might, at his election, have considered the writing obligatory as assets, and have sued upon it as administrator, as held in Hemphill vs. Hamilton, Eng. . As regards the alleged variance that the instrument described in the summons and which the defendant was called to answer, was a note of hand, and that offered in evidence was a writing obligatory, it may be well to review our former decisions; some of which would seem to sustain the objection taken. In the case of Jeffry vs. Underwood, Ark. Rep. , the same state of facts presented here, came up for consideration. The defendant was summoned to answer the complaint of the plaintiff upon a note of hand, and the instrument offered in evidence was a sealed instrument. The court held the variance fatal. It may be well to inquire whether, admitting this decision to be correct, (and we will not question its correctness under the statute then in force,) the change in our statute, since that decision does not materially affect the decision. Prior to the passage of our present statute, which took effect 20th March, , it was not necessary to file the cause of complaint upon which the suit was brought, until the commencement of the trial! The defendant had no other information in regard to the nature of the demand which he was summoned to answer, than that disclosed in the summons! The form of the summons is given, and under it the instrument is to be set out. See sec. Steel & McCamp. Dig. p. . In this respect, our statute, as it existed when the present suit was commenced, and as it now exists, is materially different. Section Dig., ch. provides that “ wherever any suit shall be founded on any instrument of writing, pui-porting to have been executed by the defendant, such instrument shall be filed with the justice, before any process shall be issued in the suit.” And in sec. , which gives the form of a summons, the description of the demand, upon which the recovery is sought, is omitted. The Legislature, in making this change evidently intended, by require ing the instrument, upon which the suit was to be brought, to be filed before the summons issued, to make it accessible to the defendant, and to furnish him with the necessary information, to enable him to defend against it. The defendant no longer looks under our present statute, to the summons for such information; and should it be unnecessarily inserted, it may be considered as surplusage. The instrument filed is the true evidence of the nature of the complaint. It is in effect a declaration, upon which the action rests, and is also, in some instances, the evidence of the demand. We have no later decisions that come fully up to the precise question now under consideration. So far as they go, however, they may be said to sustain the views which we have expressed. In Levy vs. Sherman, Eng. , suit was brought on a bank note of the Bank of Missouri. The main question was, whether any cause of action was filed; that is, whether a bank note, not endorsed, was evidence of indebtedness from the plaintiff to the defendant. The coui't, in considering that question, remarked upon this statute, to the effect that a description of the instrument sued on, was unnecessary in the summons, as says the court, “it could at all times be examined and inspected by the parties. The plaintiff is required to put his cause of action on file, in order that the adverse party may know what he is called upon to answer.” In Patterson vs. Wilson, Eng. , the summons was silent as to the cause of complaint. The justice described the instrument sued upon as a note, when, in fact, that filed was a bond. The court held, (and no doubt, correctly,) that the writing obligatory was competent evidence. In Anthony Ex parte, Ark. , the suit was commenced upon a change ticket, which, however, was not filed. It is true that the summons required'the defendant to appear and answer in an action of account. But that was not the important enquiry. It was that no cause of action was filed, and that if filed it was such as the court could not proceed to try, as held in Reeves vs. Clark. We have taken occasion to make this brief review of the former decisions of the court to show that the case of Jeffry vs. Underwood, is not authority under, our present statute, and that our other decisions favor the conclusions which we have announced; that, as the statute requires the instrument on which the suit is founded, to be filed before the summons issues and dispenses with any description of it in the summons, that the party defendant .should look to the instrument on file, and not to the summons for the cause of action against him. And consequently that a variance between the instrument on file, and that described in the summons will not avail the defendant on the trial. This construction is, in our opinion, in conformity with the spirit and intention of the statute, and will tend to remove a mere technical objection to a proceeding in a court where the most liberal construction should be indulged in favor of the regularity of its proceedings. The Circuit Court therefore erred in excluding the writing obligatory as evidence from the jury.

1862687,Jordan vs. Hart,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court. The declaration in this case was demurred to solely upon the ground that it was not entitled as in any court; and the Circuit Court sustained the demurrer. This is the only question of error presented. It is true, that in the commencement of the declaration, neither the court nor the term of the court at which the writ is to be made returnable, is set forth. The declaration gives the venue,. “The State of Arkansas and county of Clark,” and then proceeds to the statement of the cause of action.' It cannot be a matter of importance with us to look into the reasons for entitling the declaration as of a particular term, or day of the term, as but few of them are applicable to our practice. Here the plaintiff is required by statute, to file his declaration or statement in writing in the-clerk’s office of the county, in which he institutes his suit; and the-clerk of the Circuit Court thereupon issues his writ, returnable-to the first day of the next succeeding term of the court, unless such declaration be filed within fifteen days of the first term, and¡ then it is returnable to the second term of the said court; so that there is at best, but little necessity for a formal entitling of the declaration. The objection is extremely technical, and at most could only, be cause of special demurrer, which is disallowed by statute. The Circuit Court therefore erred in sustaining the demurred to the plaintiff’s declaration; and for this error the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings to be had therein according to law..",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,negative
1862718,Sumpter vs. Tucker,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an action of debt upon a note executed by Sumpter^ made payable to James R. Kinkead, and by him assigned, by his within endorsement thereon, to the plaintiff. As the only questions of law arising upon the record, relate to the fourth, fifth and sixth pleas of the defendant, we will direct our examination directly to them. The fourth plea denied the assignment of the note by Kinkead to the plaintiff, and was properly stricken out upon motion, because not verified by affidavit. Sanger vs. Sumner, Ark. Rep. . The fifth and 6th pleas are substantially the same. They admitted the assignment to the plaintiff, but set up a payment of the sum, for which the note was assigned to the plaintiff by Kinkead; and a re-delivery of the note by plaintiff to him, in whose possession it remained until his death. Upon motion, the defendant was ruled to elect, which of these pleas he would rely upon, and to abandon the other; and having elected to rely upon the 5th plea, the plaintiff demurred to it, because the facts set forth in the plea show that the legal right of action is in the plaintiff. The counsel for Sumpter contends that the re-delivery of the note by the plaintiff to Kinkead, did, by operation of law re-invest him with the legal title to it. This position is wholly irreconcilable with our decision in the case of Block vs. Walker Ark. Rep. , where it is held, that when a note or bond is regularly assigned and delivered to the assignee, the legal title can only pass from him to another by a re-assignment of such note or bond. Nor does this decision, in the slightest degree, conflict with our later decisions. In the case of Martin vs. Warren, Eng. , the assignment was made by a blank endorsement and delivery of the bill, which bill, with the endorsement still in blank, came again to the hands of the assignor. It was held that being thus returned in blank, it vested in the holder a right to fill up the blank, and perfect the assignment in himself, or to pass it to another: and this rule was recognized and re-affirmed in Sanger vs. Sumner. The counsel seems to have urged the applicability of the rule in Martin vs. Warren, to the case under consideration, under a misapprehension of the facts set up in the plea. It is not averred as he seems to suppose, that the assignment was in blank. And taking the construction against the pleader, we must infer that it was otherwise, or he would hav'e so stated it. The facts of the case bring it directly within the rule laid down in Block vs. Walker: and the rule there held is decisive of this point. Therefore the Circuit Court did not err in sustaining the demurrer to said plea. As regards the alleged error of the court below, in compelling the pleader to elect, which of two pleas setting up the same defence, he would rely upon, there can be no doubt, from the nature of the two pleas, that the court decided correctly. Precisely the same grounds are relied upon, but slightly different in the statement of them. If the difference of the statement of facts would make one a valid defence, and the other not, it is .the fault of the party, should he elect to rely upon that which is insufficient, and he has no cause for complaint,, that he selected the wrong plea. There is no other point which we deem- it important to notice. Judgment affirmed. Watkins, Cl J., not sitting,",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862698,Pryor vs. Wright,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1852-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. Wright sued Pryor, in debt, in the Hempstead Circuit Court, on two promissory notes, payable'at the office of Wright, Williams, & Co., New Orleans. Besides the pleas of nil debet and payment, on which issues were joined, Pryor interposed a further plea, that the notes in the declaration mentioned, were made payable at the office of Wright, Williams "" Co., New Orleans, State of Louisiana, one of the United States of America, and that, by the laws of that State, at the dates of the notes and then still in force, all notes made payable at a particular place within that State, are required to be presented, and a demand of payment made at such place, and in default of presentment and demand, the maker is discharged from payment, and averred that neither of the said notes was so presented, and payment thereof demanded, and so he was released, and forever discharged from the payment of the notes in question. Upon the motion of the plaintiff, below, this third plea was stricken out, to which ruling of the court the defendant excepted, and in his bill of exceptions saved the plea in question upon the record. Afterwards the defendant withdrew his two former pleas, and saying nothing further, judgment was rendered for the plaintiff, and the defendant brought his case here on writ of error. The question presented is as to the action of the court in granting the motion to strike out the third plea. If the matters of fact set up by that plea can be established as such by evidence, the plaintiff below will be precluded from a recovery, because the law of Louisiana, thus alleged as a matter of fact to exist, governs the question of the liability of the defendant below. It is not at all probable, however, that the defendant can establish the truth of his plea by evidence, the Supreme Court of Louisiana, having, as we have learned, as a matter of fact de hors this record, overturned the previous decisions of that court by the case of Ripka vs. Pope, ( Lou. Annual Rep. ) and conformed to what has long been considered the American doctrine — entertained now,perhaps, by every appellate court in the Union — that as to the acceptor of a bill, and maker of a promissory note payable at a Bank, or other specific place, no presentment or demand of payment need be made at the specified place on the day when the bill or note becomes due, or after-wards, in order to maintain a suit against the acceptor, or maker, and of course that there need be no averment in the declaration in any suit brought thereon, or any proof at the trial of any such demand, or presentment. Such omission being matter of defence to the extent only, in general, that if the maker, or acceptor had funds at the appointed time and place, to pay the note, or bill, he shall be exonerated, not indeed, from the payment of the principal sum, but from cost and damages in such suit. In special cases, however, as if the bill or note was payable at a Bank, and the acceptor, or maker, had funds there at the time, which are afterwards lost by the failure of the Bank, then the acceptor, or maker, would be further exonerated, on showing such loss in his defence, to the extent of the loss thus sustained (Story on Prom. Notes, sec. . Nevertheless the court below had no more authority to strike out the defendant’s plea in question, than it would have had to strike out his other plea of payment, founded upon some personal knowledge of the presiding judge, that no payment at all had ever been made, and therefore, that he could not prove that plea. A defendant has a right to plead any matter of fact which may be an answer to the plaintiff’s demand; and the laws of the sister States are, beyond their limits, to be pleaded and proved as matters of fact. Whether he can prove the matter alleged in his plea, the plaintiff can ascertain by taking issue upon it. If he cannot, of course his defence fails, and the plaintiff obtains judgment. For the error of the court below in granting the motion to strike out the plea in question, the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded to be proceeded with. Waticins, C.

1862634,"Higgs, as admr. vs. Warner","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. Higgs, as administrator, sued Warner, in assumpsit, for services rendered by his intestate in his lifetime, as an attorney at law, and as an ordinary agent, exhibiting a bill of particulars. Warner, besides the pleas of non-assumpsit and set-off, relied upon the plea of the statute of limitations. The replication to the latter plea, although taken in short on the record by consent, we shall consider as a special one ; otherwise, the plaintiff’s case would be at an end at once for want of appropriate allegations of the special facts, which he complains the court below refused to allow him to prove by the evidence he offered. The evidence thus offered, and which the court refused to permit the plaintiff to produce to the jury, was, that of “ an account” filed in the Probate Court, upon which Warner obtained an allowance against the estate of the intestate, “ for debts” due by Hightower, the intestate, at the time of his death, which bore date and were charged within three years, next before the commencement of this suit. The object avowed by the plaintiff in offering this evidence, was to prove by it that a mutual open account current, existed between Plightower, in his lifetime, and the defendant, Warner, this action having been brought, as the plaintiff alleges, to recover any balance that might be found due upon the-proper adjustment of such account, so as to bring his case within the provision of the 17th section of the statute of limitation (Dig.p. .) We have chosen to say that he offered to prove this fact of such a “ mutual open account current,” by this evidence alone, because it is certified to us by the court below, that the bill of exceptions in the record, contains all the evidence that was offered and read to the jury on the trial of the cause, and we have examined the bill of exceptions closely, and find in it no other, either offered and refused, or actually produced to the jury, which in the least conduces to prove any such “ a mutual open account current.” Under such circumstances, then, did the court ¡below err in refusing to permit the plaintiff to read the alleged account in evidence ? To determine this question we must ascertain the meaning of the section of the limitation act, just cited, in its connection with the other provisions of the statute'. Its own words are its best exponent, that when an action shall be “ brought to recover any balance due upon a mutual open account current, the cause of action shall be deemed to have accrued from the time of the last item proved in such account.” It was not to exempt open accounts current from the operation of the statute, not even when Such accounts were mutual, but to fix the point of time from which the statute would begin to run on any such latter. According to very common custom in this State, store accounts for goods sold, are due the first day of January following the year in which they are made. From that time the statute ordinarily begins to run upon them, the customer being supposed to have purchased with reference to this common custom, and therefore agreéd to the maturity of the account at that time. Otherwise the general rule might apply, which is, in general, applicable to tradesmen and artificers, &c., that the statute would run from the day of each article delivered, or piece of work done, and the continuation of the supply, or of the work done, would not interrupt it; and differing essentially from a duty which requires a continuation of services to complete the one act, as the duty of an attorney to commence and manage a suit. So the time for the closing of a mutual account current, might be stipulated for between the parties, either expressly or by implication, and the statute would run on the balance from that day, unless absorbed in a new mutual open account, in which the balance might form the first item. But if there be no stipulation between the parties, the statute enacts that the cause ofiaction shall be deemed to accrue from the date of the last item. It is not, however, every open account current between parties, although they may severally have cross open accounts against each'other, that is a mutual one within the meaning of the statute. Such former would of course be matter of set-off on either side, and by agreement could be converted into one indivisible open mutual account current; but unless by such agreement, either express or implied, they would remain two several open accounts current, and not one entire indivisible mutual account, for which the balance only could be proceeded for, as contemplated by the section of the statute in question. In the one mutual account current, contemplated by the statute, matters of set-off become converted eo instanti, into payment, and the balance only is recoverable. It is one consolidated transaction linked together, however numerous the items, by an alternative or correlative subsisting debt on the one side inducing the credit on the other. Agreement either express or implied, is of the very essence of such a mutual account current; because it is the act of the parties, and not the act of the law. The law but recognizes their act and carries out their intention as manifested by their act. It does not of its own force, convert cross dealings into one indivisible mutual account, but encourages gai’ties to do so, as it does to use their cross demands as’set-off rather than institute an independent cross action upon them. When, however, the parties elect to pursue the course of dealing contemplated by the statute, it necessarily results that any one item on either side of the one mutual account would draw to it every other item with which it was connected by this chain of dealing, because in the view of the statutory provision-, we are considering lire whole is one entire transaction. It could not, however, possibly draw to it any item with which it was not so connected for want of the essential element of the mutual agreement of the pai'ties. Analogous to a payment made by a party who failed to exercise his right of appropriation, when making a payment to a creditor who holds two separate demands, one barred by the statute and the other not; and the creditor, in the exercise of his ordinary right of appropriation, applies it in part liquidation of the stale demand, such would not be a part payment within the statute, so as to revive the remedy for want of the essential elements of appropriation by the debtor. Whether or not, then, in a case like this at bar, there was such a course of mutual dealings between the parties as is contemplated by the statute, is a material fact. And as such a course of dealings is founded upon the agreement of the parties, express or implied, and does not necessarily follow', as the consequence of the fact, that each party may have an open account current against the other, there is no ground from which to presume such course of dealing, even prima facie from proof of the existence of a cross open account current, as there would be to presume appropriation of a partial payment, made generally to a creditor, who held a subsisting demand ; because, in the latter case, in the absence of all repelling circumstances, the payment could be referred to nothing else than to this subsisting demand, whereas, in the former case the credit given, which would constitute the cross demand, might well enough, until the contrary should appear by facts or circumstances, be regarded as a credit at large. In the usual course of dealings, men rarely pay money unless they owe it, whilst it is one of the most ordinary circumstances in common life for a man to credit one he does not owe. If, therefore, the court had permitted the evidence in question to have gone to the jury,’unconnected as it was with the proof of any other fact or circumstance, in any degree conducing to prove the existence of a mutual open account current, within the meaning of the statute, between the plaintiff’s intestate and the defendant, a verdict founded upon it in favor of the plaintiff would have been so utterly without evidence to sustain it, that it could not have been permitted to stand. So that even if we might think the evidence in question competent as tending one step towards the establishment of the main fact, the burthen of which was upon the plaintiff to pr-ove, its exclusion under the state of this case, as it appears upon the record, in no way worked the prejudice of the plaintiff.. We .think, also, that there was no error in the court below to permit the reading in evidence, to prove the set-off, the “proceedings, recovery and record,” as it appears by the bill of exceptions was allowed : and the judgment recovered in that court against the plaintiff, as administrator, was, we think, a good matter of set-off under our statute. (Dig. ch. , sec. , . We find no error in the ruling of the court, either as to the instruction given, or those refused. The ‘ruling as to these was substantially correct. It was suggested by the counsel for the appellee, that there was no question upon this record for the consideration of this court, because, although the plaintiff below excepted to the decision of the court overruling his motion for a new trial, he failed to have a bill of exceptions sealed. In the case of Berry vs. Singer, ( Eng. R. at p. ) we remarked that “ we would not go the length that is apparently indicated in Sawyer vs. Lathrop ( Eng. R. ), of requiring that the evidence should, in every case, be brought upon the record, only after the overruling of a, motion for a new trial. On the contrary, we think that if it may have been brought regularly upon the record before, and the record shows distinctly that all the evidence was so regularly of record; as might well be done in exceptions that might be taken by bill to the giving or refusing to give instructions to the jury in order to show the application or misapplication of the law to the facts, there would be no more necessity in such case of reproducing such evidence in the last bill of exceptions to the overruling of the motion for a new trial than there would be to reconstruct any other part of the re-» cord. Because the waiver which is the result of a motion for a new trial, is no mutilation of the record, producing thereby any necessity for its reproduction in the last bill of exceptions, but simply a waiver of the right to insist upon exceptions taken during the trial, as mere errors in law,” unless preserved by exceptions taken to the overruling of the motion for a new trial. In the case at bar, all the evidence produced on the trial, and that which the court would not allow to be produced to the jury, as well as all the instructions given and refused, are upon the record regularly, and so is the motion for a new trial, and the exception of the appellant to the decision of the court overruling his motion for a new trial. A bill of exceptions could have therefore brought nothing more upon the record than was already there; and that distinguishes this case from that of Ford vs. Clark, ( Eng. R. ), and several other cases. Watkins, C. J., not sitting in this case.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862643,Mason ad. vs. Howell,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an action of debt on a promissory note, due on the 30th of September, . The defendant interposed several pleas, upon which issues were joined, and also that the plaintiff’s cause of action had not accrued within three years next before the commencement of the suit. To this plea the plaintiff replied first, to the effect that his intestate had instituted suit on the note in question, in the Johnson Circuit Court, on the 14th of February, , against the defendant and his co-promissor, John Howell, pending which suit plaintiff departed this life, and at the December term of said court, in the year , his death was suggested, and that such further proceedings were had afterwards in that suit; that at the September term of said court, in the year , it was ordered to be revived, and progress in the name of the plaintiff as administrator, at which term the defendant and said John pleaded to the action, and on the 2d day of September , in that court, the plaintiff recovered judgment in that suit, for the amount of said pote with damages and costs of suit. That said judgment was removed by writ of error to the Supreme Court, where it was adjudged and decided that the judgment of the Johnson Circuit Court was null and void, and that the writ of error be dismissed: whereby the judgment and, proceedings had in the Johnson Circuit Court became, and were arrested; and that the plaintiff, on the 8th of December, , and within one year after such adjudication and decision of the Supreme Court, commenced the present suit against the defendant. The second replication is to the effect that the defendant and his co-promissor, John Howell, were partners in trade, and made the note in question on account of their partnership concerns, and that John Howell, on the first day of March, , and within five years next before the commencement of this suit, made a certain payment to the plaintiff upon the note in question. The facts intended to be set up in the replication are stated so as to give the plaintiff in error the full benefit of them without regard to any defect of form. Upon demurrer sustained to the replications, final judgment went against the plaintiff in error.- The questions of law presented upon this record may be briefly disposed of. The first replication is no avoidance of the bar setup in the plea, because regarding the decision of this court, whatever it was, to be the law of the case, there was no judgment of the Johnson Circuit Court to be arrested or reversed on error; and the plaintiff fails to bring himself within the savings of the 24th section of the statute of limitations. The second replication ie bad, because, according to the repeated decisions of this court, the act of December 14th, , being prospective, does not apply to causes of action accruing prior to its passage, which are-governed by the then existing laws, as to the limitation of actions, which was three years upon promissory notes, so that the part payment alleged to have been made in , did not have the legal effect of extendingthe right of action for five years from that period. But under the decision in Biscoe vs. Jenkins, ( Eng. R. ,) another objection is fatal to this replication. The first payment by John Howell having been after the note in suit-was barred, would have the effect to revive the debt as against him, but would not revive it against his co-promissor. The judgment of the court below must be affirmed with costs. Hon. G. O. Watkins, Chief Justice, and Hon. David Walker, Justice not sitting. »",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral

This case was before this court at a previous term, ( Eng. ,) and was reversed. The evidence on the second trial, if not identically, is at least substantially the same as reported. It has become the settled law of this court, that a refusal to grant a new trial, on the general ground that the verdict is contrary to law and evidence, will not be reviewed, unless there is a total lack of evidence upon one or more points necessary to the maintainance of the action, or making out the defence. Where the question simply is as to the weight or sufficiency of the evidence, this court will not disturb either the finding of the court sitting as a jury, or the verdict of the jury. Drennen vs. Brown, Eng. . Sparks vs. Beaver, Eng. . State Bank vs. Conway ante, Mitchell vs. State Bank, ante. These rules we are disposed to adhere to; but averse as we are, to disturbing the verdict of a jury, yet there are cases in which it is necessary to the attainment of justice, and to decline that duty altogether, would imply, that we regarded jurors as infallible, which is far from being the fact. We would not invade their constitutional authority, but at the samé time we would not have it understood that they are final arbiters of life, liberty and property. In the case now before the court, the verdict is without evidence to sustain it, and falls within the rule above laid down, and the judgment must be reversed. Watiuns, O.

1862703,"Rawdon, Wright & Hatch vs. Rapley et al.","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1849-01,Ark.,"S. H. Hempstead, Special Judge, delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an action of debt brought by the plaintiffs against the defendants, on a recognizance conditioned in substance, that the Real Estate Bank should prosecute with effect, a writ of error which she had sued out in the case of herself against the present plaintiffs, and on which she had obtained a supersedeas, and pay the money that might be adjudged against her by the Supreme Court, or otherwise abide the decision of that court therein. It appears that the judgment in that case was reversed on the 22d August, , and the case ordered to be remanded for further proceedings. On the 27th August the defendants in error in that suit, filed a motion for reconsideration, and obtained leave to submit a written argument, on or before the first day of the next term, to which term the case was continued. The opinion of the court was not recalled, nor the judgment set aside, nor suspended. On the 10th January, , at the succeeding term, the petition for reconsideration was filed, and taken under advisement, and on the 7th July, , at the following term, the cause was ordered to stand for rehearing, the judgment to be set aside, and it was then taken under advisement. On the 7th August, , the order of 7th July, , was annulled, the petition for reconsideration refused, and the judgment of , ordered to stand as the judgment of the court. On the 9th August, , this last order was set aside, and the cause was again submitted to the court and was argued by counsel, and on consideration, whereof the judgment of the Circuit Court was reversed and ordered to relate back to and take effect as of the first day of the term. This seems to be the present attitude of the suit, and certainly no examples could more forcibly demonstrate the evils which must result from attempts to disturb the judgments and decrees of courts of record, after the term at which they were pronounced, has passed. It seems at one time to have been regarded as a question of practice in this court resting upon the sound discretion of the judges. But difficulties of such a formidable character sprung out of the practice, as to induce the judges to pause and investigate the question of power, and it was then announced, as a true principle, that under our system of jurisprudence, courts of record do not possess the power and authority to vacate, annul, reverse, or suspend their judgments and decrees after the term has passed. Ashley vs. Hyde & Goodrich, Eng. . And it was said in that case, that “upon principle and precedent when the Supreme Court once adjudicates a question, pronounces its opinion, renders judgment thereon, and the term el apses, leaving the judgment in full force, the case passes forever beyond the jurisdiction of the court; except it again be brought up by appeal or otherwise, after another trial in the inferior tribunal.” After a careful examination, we entirely approve of the doctrine in that case, and hold it to be the settled law of this court. So far indeed from being dissatisfied with it, we cannot conceive on what possible grounds a different doctrine could be maintained, without converting courts of record into courts of original and appellate jurisdiction, and allowing them to pronounce judgments at one term and reverse them at another, and thereby exercise a power, neither inherent in or delegated to them. As to this question, this court is not different from other courts. Indeed, as there is no tribunal to revise our acts, it is our imperative duty, in all cases, to avoid the exercise of all doubtful powers. It cannot be denied that there is a right inherent in the nature and organization of every court of record, to amend judgments and process at any time, in order to attain the ends of justice and perfect the proceedings according to the truth, as it existed at the time. And this right has its origin in the general power of the court to do justice, rather than in any statute of jeofails. Mara vs. Quinn, Term Rep. . Dillon vs. The Mayor of Grampond, Term Rep. . King vs. The State Bank. Eng. . But this is quite a different question from setting aside or vacating a judgment after the term has passed. The one is intended to perfect the proceedings and maintain the jurisdiction of the court, the other to destroy — the one is to uphold, the other to overturn. The judgment of reversal rendered in the case of The Real Estate Bank vs. Rawdon, Wright & Hatch, ( Ark. ,) at the July term , was not set aside nor recalled at that term. The leave to file a motion for reconsideration, and a written argument at the next term, and the continuauce of the cause could notin our opinion have that effect. Nor was the judgment ever regarded by this court as having been set aside or suspended, because, on the. 7th July, , a reconsideration was granted, and the judgment for the first time ordered to be set aside; and although this order was irregular, yet it serves to show that, up to that time the judgment was considered as in full force. In Ashley vs. Hyde & Goodrich, Eng. , it was held that the filing of a motion for leave to present a petition for rehearing' or granting that leave by the court, or actually filing such petition could not have the effect of suspending the judgment of the court. This we regard as a decisive authority on the present question: because, although a continuance was ordered in the case of The Real Estate Bank vs. Rawdon, Wright Hatch, and none in the case just quoted, yet it will readily occur to any one that that is an immaterial circumstance, and cannot affect the principle decided. The two cases are similar, and identical in substance, because, to grant leave to file a petition for rehearing at a future term, would seem to be equivalent to a continuance of the cause to that term, for otherwise the leave could not be made available. That the court might have intended to set aside or suspend the judgment rendered in , may be admitted,but that it was done either directly or indirectly, or that any act equivalent to it was performed at that term, is a proposition which cannot in our opinion be maintained. We are compelled by precedent and principle to declare that the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of The Real Estate Bank against Rawdon, Wright & Hatch, rendered the 22d August, , was a valid and binding judgment, not reversed, vacated nor suspended, and that all the action, and orders, and proceedings of the Supreme Court with regard thereto subsequent to the term at which the judgment was pronounced, were nullities, possessing no judicial sanction, the jurisdiction over the subject matter being exhausted at that term, as was held by this court in the late case of Cossitt vs. Biscoe, Eng. . It may not be amiss to remark that we cannot' perceive any ground for a reconsideration, and if the judgment of the Circuit Court was now directly before us for revision, we should have no hesitation in reversing it, as did the old court, because it is clear enough from all the facts that the present,plaintiffs in error gave credit to, and looked to Williamson the agent for payment, doubtless preferring his responsibility to that of the Bank; and their remedy was not against the Bank, but Williamson, individually. Real Estate Bank vs. Rawdon et al., Ark. . It only remains for us to say that, as the judgment of , was valid binding and unreversed,itfollows as a necessary consequence that the writ of error was prosecuted with effect, and the condition of the recognizance performed. While the defendants in error as sureties are to be held to their engagements, yet their liability is not to be extended by implication; and as it appears on the merits that they are not liable, the court correctly found for them, and discharged them by its judgment. Other questions discussed by counsel with great ability, we do not deem it necessary to investigate or decide on the present occasion, contenting ourselves with affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court, as on the whole record we consider it to be right.

1862627,Holleville vs. Patrick,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1850-07,Ark.,"S. H. Hempstead, Special Judge, delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an action of assumpsit, brought by Patrick against Holleville, and in which there was a trial by jury on the general issue, and a verdict and judgment for Patrick, to review which this writ of error has been sued out by Holleville. The declaration contains two counts, similar to each other, but on two different causes of action; and it may be remarked, that a declaration could hardly be more inartificially drawn, and if we felt disposed to countenance technical objections, there would be no difficulty in finding them in it. The case stands in this court on the declaration alone; because the bonds and assignments therein described have not been made a part of the record by oyer, bill of exceptions or otherwise, and cannot be noticed for any purpose whatever, although copied into the transcript. The declaration avers the writings obligatory to have been made by William Strong and payable to Holleville on the 1st January, ; that they were before payment, assigned by him to Patrick, “to wit, on the 10th day of July, :” that when they became due, they were presented fpr payment, and payment required “according to the tenor and effect thereof;” but that neither Strong nor Holleville paid the same; and it is then averred that “of all which said premises the said Holleville afterwards, to wit: on the 10th day of July, , had notice.” As a general rule, it is not to be denied, that a party is always bound by his own pleadings, and can make no proof in contravention of them. But it is equally as well established, as an exception, that it is not essential to state the real or precise time unless it constitutes a material part of the contract; nor in criminal proceedings, except where time forms an ingredient of the offence. And although a certain day is stated, yet neither in civil nor criminal cases, need the day be proved as laid, but an entirely different day may be proved, and it will be well enough. Chitty's Pl. , . Chitty's Cr. L. . In assumpsit on a contract, whether express or implied, the plaintiff is at liberty to prove that it was made at any other time than that alleged. Stra. . So, in an action against the acceptor of a bill payable after sight, an allegation that it was accepted on the day of the date will be proved, though it appear it was accepted on a subsequent day. Chitty's Pl. . It was neither necessary nor usual to aver in the declaration the precise time when the assignments were made, or when payment was required, or notice of non-payment given. These were all matters of evidence, which, for the sake of preserving brevity and perspicuity in pleading, are never to be stated. Chitty's Pl. . Those dates were stated under a videlicet, and we are of opinion, might have been rejected as surplusage, and which will not vitiate after verdict. Chapman vs. Smith John. . Hyslop vs. Jones, McLean, . The case of Jackson vs. Henderson, Leigh, , , is an express authority to the point, that if the declaration avers that a bill was presented, and payment demanded when the same became due and payable, and then under a scilicet, states a precise day on which it was done, that day is immaterial, need not be proved, and may be rejected as surplusage. To the same effect is the case of Bynner vs. Russell, Bingham . S. C. Moore , on the authority of which the case in Virginia was decided. It cannot admit of serious doubt, that it was competent for either party on the trial, to have proved that the assignments had been made, or that payment had been demanded, or notice of non-payment given at different periods from those averred in the declaration. Neitherparty was bound by those piecise dates, and might, as we have seen, have treated them as surplusage, and for aught we can know, such proof might have been actually-made as above indicated. This case was tried by a jury on the general issue. No exceptions were taken during the trial, nor was any motion made for a new trial, or in arrest of judgment. It stands on error, and consequently if the declaration discloses a cause of action the judgment must be affirmed. The doctrine on this subject is that when a declaration or other pleading sets forth a good title or ground of action in a defective manner, the imperfection will be cured by verdict, but a want of title is not aided. Saund. , Sound. , a, b. c. Bac. Abr. Verdict (X) . And this court in Sevier vs. Holliday, Ark. , approved and laid down the same principle, namely, that “where there is any defect, imperfection or omission in any pleading, whether in substance or in form, which would have been a fatal objection on demurrer, yet if the issue joined be such as necessarily requires on the trial, proof of the faots so defectively or imperfectly stated, or omitted, and without which it is not to be presumed that either the judge would direct the jury to give, or the jury would have given the verdict, such defect, imperfection or omission is cured by the verdict at common law.” Now no one can read the declaration without perceiving that it discloses a right or cause of action, although partially obscured by the want of technical skill and precision in the pleader. The imperfections in it are precisely of that character which a verdict was intended, under the rule above laid down, to cure. And it is the more essential that it should be so, because, independent of the general presumption of correctness which attaches to judgments of inferior courts until the contrary is made to appear, we may well suppose that on the trial, such facts were proved as established the liability of the plaintiff in error, holding it clear that this might have been done under the declaration, and on the issue that was formed. The case of Ruston vs. Aspinall, Dougl. , relied on by th© counsel for the plaintiff in error, is not applicable, because, the declaration failed to allege a demand and refusal by the acceptor; but in this declaration, demand, refusal and notice are alleged. Considering that the declaration in this case discloses a cause of action, and that the imperfections in it'are cured by the verdict, and we affirm the judgment. Watkins, C.

1862655,Ruddell vs. Folsom,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court. This suit is brought against Ruddell alone, on the joint obligation of Moore and himself. The bond was barred by the statute of limitations, unless the bar was removed by part payment-The defendant pleaded the statute of limitations, to which the plaintiff replied generally. Under this issue, the plaintiff offered evidence of such part payment, but the defendant objected to the evidence upon two grounds, first, that the evidence offered was-incompetent and inadmissible to prove part payment; and second, that if admissible as evidence in other respects, it u as inadmissible under the issue formed. The court overruled his objections and permitted the evidence to be given under the issue, to which the defendant excepted. The same question was again-presented upon a motion for a new trial; and upon exception to-the opinion of the court in refusing, to grant a new trial, the case* is brought here by appeal. Under the issue formed it devolved upon the plaintiff to prove-that the cause of action had accrued within five years next before-the commencement of the suit, which dates from-the filing of the bond, which, under the statute, is in effect a declaration, and the issuing of the writ thereon, and the time- when the bond fell due ; facts to be established by the terms of the contract, and the record evidence of the commencement of the suit. If the plaintiff should seek to avoid the force and effect of this evidence,by show-in§,a new promise, or a new and different point from which the-statute bar commenced to run, it is an affirmative matter, the truth of which he must show, and he must also necessarily confess the time at which the bar, by the terms of the contract, commenced running. It is then necessarily like matter in confession and avoidance, and should be so replied. Chitty, in his work on pleading, vol. , page , says that, when the plea is that the cause of action did not accrue within, &c., the plaintiff could prove a promise or acknowledgment within.that time, and that the replication might, in such case, be general; but if the time of issuing the first writ in the action were material, it must have been replied specially : and adds, that a special replication is, in general, advisable. And upon this distinction as to whether the plea does, or does not put the time of issuing the writ in issue, rest all the cases to which the plaintiff has referred, except the cases decided in Massachusetts Reports, which, upon quite a different state of case, give preference to the proceeding by special replication, and in case the time of issuing the writ is putin issue, make it indispensably necessary to plead specially. Greenleaf, in his work on Evidence, vol. , sec. , page , says, “ that if the plaintiff would avoid the bar by proof of an acknowledgment of the claim, he can only do it under a special replication of a new promise within the time limited.” And so, also, the exceptions in favor of merchant and merchant, and other exceptions must be replied specially. Id. sec. -. In the case of Trustees vs. Hartfield, Ark. Rep. , the precise question as to whether part payment could or not be given in evidence under the general replication, was not discussed; but the court in passing upon the sufficiency of the special replication, held, that part payment might be given under the general replication, or might be replied specially. In Walker vs. Bank Mississippi, Eng. Rep. , although the question was not directly before the court, and for that reason cannot be held as overruling in express terms the case of Trustees vs. Hartfield, the court held that an avoidance of the statute bár by limitation, under any of the exceptions of the statute, should be specially replied. And in Ringgold & Hynson vs. Dunn, Eng. , the same rule was held, when more fully presented, and in still stronger terms. In McClelland vs. The Bank, Eng. , where a general replication was filed to a plea of the statute of limitation, the record of a former suit brought on the same cause of action was offered in evidence, to bring the case within the exception of the 24th section, Dig. chap. , which allows the plaintiff to renew his action within one year next after a judgment of non-suit, it was held that in order to let in evidence of such former suit, the plaintiff should have filed a special replication setting up such facts in avoidance of the statute bar. And in the case of Woods vs. State Bank, Eng. , and also in a case still more recently decided, Bank vs. Conway, January term, , it was held the safer and more regular practice to require part payment, when relied upon to remove the statute bar, to be specially replied. So that it is not now an open question of practice, but one sactioned and approved by this court, both upon sound principles of pleading and authority: and being, in our opinion, best calculated to present the definite matter in issue disencumbered from the other facts which might arise under the general replication, and to limit the proof to it, we do not feel at liberty to depart from it. Evidence of part payment was, therefore, inadmissible under the issue as formed, and should have been excluded by the court, independent of all consideration of its sufficiency otherwise, which we will next proceed to consider. There were several credits upon the bond, all of which, except one, purported to be payments made by Moore, the obligor, not sued. The first payment appears to have been made by Moore, and, if proven to have been made at the time it bore date, would have removed the statute bar. To prove this the plaintifF offered in evidence the following instrument, to-wit: “All of the above credits were made by me, except the three dollars, and the dates of the credits are correct. Decir. 2d, . (signed) Wm. Moore.” And after proving the execution thereof, offered the same, together with the first endorsement of a payment (which purported to have been made by Moore) as evidence, and the same, against the objections of the defendant, were admitted as evidence to the jury. In order to prove part payment, as against a co-obligor, it must be shown that such payment was made at a time when its legal effect would be to remove the statute bar. Bank vs. Wooddy, Eng. . Wood vs. Wylds, Eng. . The mere endorsement of a credit, as of a date to effect this, isjnot of itself sufficient: but it must be shown that the endorsement of payment was in fact made within such time. But where the endorsement is made by the obligors, or one of them, then proof of that fact will be sufficient evidence to permit the endorsement to be read as evidence, as well of the date as the fact of payment. After the statute bar has attached no act or admission of one •co-obligor will bind another. Trustees vs. Jenkins, et al. Eng. . Such acts and admissions are alone binding upon the party making them. Moore’s admissions, therefore, at the time when they were made, whether wiitten or verbal, were inadmissible as evidence against Ruddell, and should have been excluded. He was not sued, and was clearly a competent witness to prove the fact of such payment, as well as the time when it was made, whether made by Ruddell or himself.

1862706,Arrington vs. Washington,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1852-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the court. This was a suit in chancery, to enjoin a judgment at law. The grounds for equitable relief are: that the complainant was security for one Whitfield, upon a delivery bond. That after the bond was forfeited and before the rendition of tlie judgment thereon, Arrington, the creditor, without the knowledge or consent of the complainant, made a new contract with Whitfield, the principal in the bond, by which he postponed the payment of the debt to a further day. And also, upon the further ground, that after the bond had been returned forfeited, and before suit upon it, the creditor sued out an alias execution upon the original judgment against Whitfield, the principal in the bond, and caused the same to be levied upon the personal property of Whitfield, of value sufficient to pay the debt, and that after such levy, by the order of the creditor, the execution was returned without sale or disposition of the property. It becomes unnecessary to decide upon the merits of the equitable defence here set up, or whether it is sustained by proof, until we dispose of a preliminary question, as to whether the defence, conceding it to be sufficient, should not have been made upon the trial of the case at law. It has been settled by the previous decisions of this court, that this is a matter of defence over which the common law and the chancery courts have concurrent jurisdiction. Hempstead & Conway vs. Watkins, ad. Eng. It is a complete legal defence? and may be.pleaded as such, Caldwell vs. McVicar, Eng. , and the defendant may elect to defend in a court of law, or should he decline to defend there, he may set up such defence in chancery. Hempstead & Conway vs. Watkins. But should he elect to defend in a court of law, and fail in his defence, ho is held to his election, and cannot again present his defence in a court of chancery, unless there is an express averment of fraud, surprise, accident, or the like, which may in some instances entitle the party to relief in chancery, notwithstanding his defence at law.

When the defendant submits himself *to the jurisdiction of the court of law, by offering any defence whatever, it matters not whether by demurrer to the declaration, plea in abatement, or in bar, it amounts to an election of jurisdiction, and having made such election, he must make defence there, and whatever defence is not made, will be considered as having been waived. Le Guen vs. Gouverneur, John. Cases, . In truth, from the moment he comes into the court of common law to defend, his election is fixed, and he stands in all respects, as if it was a defence over which the common law court had exclusive jurisdiction, and his excuse for a failui’e to make a full and successful defence must be the same as if no such concurrent jurisdiction had ever existed. In this case the parties were all before the court. The defendant demurred to the plaintiff’s declaration, upon which issue was joined, and a judgment rendered. This is a defence, a submission to the jurisdiction of the court, and an election to defend there. The nature of the defenceitself is not so important. The true enquiry is, has the court power to hear the defence, and has the defendant elected to be heard in that coui’t. If so, he must abide his election. Courts of chancei’y abhor multiplicity of act mis, and require vigilance at the hands of its favored suitors. Such vigilance was cleaxdy not shown in this case, nor is any reason assigned for declining to follow up his defence in a court that had thus acquired jurisdiction of the parties, and where an issue was tendered, upon which that court had fall power to afford the same relief that is sought in this court. It must be remembered too, that before the case of Hempstead of Conway vs. Watkins, settled the practice differently, it was rather the favored opinion that when the plaintiff tendered to the defendant an issue in a court of law, upon which the defence was full and complete in that court, such defendant was bound to make such defence, or should he suffer a default, he should not be heard thereafter in a court of chancery, even though such court had concurrent jurisdiction with the court of law to hear and determine the same. And there is certainly not wanting both good reason and authority for this ; for, admitting that the courts have concurrent jurisdiction, and are in all respects equally competent to hear the defence, that which first gets jurisdiction of the parties, and in which the issue is first tendered, would seem to have precedent right to adjudicate and finally settle the matter litigated. We are not to be understood by these remarks as dissenting from the correctness of the decision in the case of Hempstead & Conway vs. Watkins, but simply as intending to show that the rule should not be extended further. In that case there was no defence whatever : in this, there was a defence, an election to appear and defend. And in the absence of any sufficient excuse for not having followed up that defence, the defendant will not be heard to complain in this court. Because from the time such election was made, it ceased to be a matter of concurrent jurisdiction, and became a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the common law court. The defendant was not deprived of his right to select in which court he would make his defence, but did elect, and having done so must abide by it. As therefore the court of chancery had no jurisdiction of this case it becomes unnecessary to enquire whether the facts sustain the equitable defence set up or not. The decree of the Jefferson Circuit Court must therefore be reversed with instructions to assess damages ujrnn the dissolution of the injunction and to dismiss the bill.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862736,Thompson vs. Haislip,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court. The first ground of exception in this case is as to the correctness of the decision of the Circuit Court in sustaining the plaintiffs demurrei'jto the defendants plea in abatement. The matter pleaded in abatement was a varíen ce between the writ of summons and a copy of the summons served upon the defendant. This was no ground for abating the action; at most it was an indirect attack upon the sheriff’s return. If the sheriff had not, in fact, served the defendant with a true copy of the writ, and had falsely returned a valid service, it might become the subject of inquiry upon a direct proceeding against him for a false return, but was no ground whatever for abating the writ. Hughes vs. Martin, Ark. Rep. . The plea should have been stricken out! There was no necessity for demurring to it, but the objection by demurrer was also good. An issue-upon it, if tendered, would, in fact, have settled nothing beyond a question of service. The second ground is that after a judgment by default and upon inquiry of damages before the jury, the defendant was dened the privilege of cross-examining the witnesses introduced to establish the amount of damages sustained. In this we think there was error. By failing to appear and. defend, or after having appeared and pleaded in abatement, the failure of the defendant to plead in bar, was a confession of the plaintiff’s right to recover damages, and although after such default or failure to plead, the defendant could not be heard to deny that some damages were recoverable, still, it was not an admission of any particular amount of damages. If so, there would be no necessity for a writ of inquiry of damages; and although we have not found any adjudicated case settling the practice in such cases, we can see no good reason why the defendant should be deprived of his right to cross-examine the witnesses introduced by the plaintiff upon the trial of the inquiry of damages, in order to show truly what damages had been sustained. In this case we do not know what the question intended to be asked was, nor do we know the range of enquiry indulged upon the examination in chief. The opinion of the court would seem to deny all cross-examination, irrespective of the nature or extent of the enquiry. Without, therefore, knowing what the particular state of case was, or intending to be understood as deciding that any and all evidence, which, under proper issues formed, would tend to lessen the amount of damages, may be offered by the defendant upon an inquiry of damages, under the state of case pre sented we think the Circuit Court erred in refusing the defendant permission to cross-examine the plaintiff’s witnesses. And for this error the judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and the cause remanded.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862640,"Ellis vs. Cossitt, et al.","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. This is a proceeding by attachment against Ellis, a non-resident defendant. A declaration in debt for $, , a bond for costs, an affidavit for $ , and attachment bond for $, all in due form, having been filed, the clerk of tbe Circuit Court of Phillips county issued a writ, which is not questioned otherwise than we shall presently state, commanding the sheriff “to attach George W. Ellis, by all and singular his goods and chattels, bonds and tenements, credits and effects, or so much thereof as shall be sufficient to secure the sum of six hundred and seventy-one dollars and eighty-six cents, with interest thereon at the rate of per cent, per annum, from the 23d day of April, A. D. , together with the costs of this suit. And you are also commanded to summon the said George W. Ellis, if he be found in your county, to be and appear before the judge of our Circuit Court, at the court house, in and for said county of Phillips, on the 4th Monday in May next, A. D. , it being.the 24th day of said month, then and there to ant wer, Frederick H. Cossitt, James M. Howard and Ira M. Hill, merchants, and partners, trading and doing business under their firm, name and style of Cossitt, Howard & Hill, the plaintiffs in this suit, in the premises, *as set forth and sworn to. And you are further commanded, <^c.” To this writ two pleas in abatement were filed, praying that it might be quashed; first, because the said writ wants these words “ in an action of debt for the sum of fourteen hundred and fifty dollars and thirty-two cents, debt, and two hundred dollars damages second, he says that the said writ of attachment wants these words “ as sworn to.” To the first plea the plaintiffs interposed a demurrer, and replied to the second. And the issues in law and fact, severally, having been found for the plaintiffs’ below, and the defendant taking exceptions and declining to answer further, final judgment w7as rendered against him and he appealed to this court. Upon the authority of the cases of Renner vs. Reed, ( Ark. R. ) and of Childress vs. Fowler, ( Eng. R. ) it is contended that the writ ought to have been quashed on the first objection. Allowing that the remedy by attachment, both in process and pleading, in all matters beyond the scope of the statutory provision setting it on foot, is to be governed by the general provisions of law applicable to other law suits, and that these statutory provisions themselves are to be construed in reference to our entire system of laws; and recognizing the compound nature of the process of attachment, in combining a proceeding in rent with a proceeding in personam, as inculcated in the case of Childress vs. Fowler, nevertheless this writ would be good under the reasoning and spirit of the case of Renner vs. Reed, because upon the face of it, the defendant is not only advised of the nature of the complaint in its being exhibited as a money demand, but he is advised of the precise amount sworn to by the plaintiffs, and has, therefore, a much more accurate data upon which to prepare a defence, than the face of an ordinary writ would give. So far as facilities for defence are concerned — and this is the ground Upon which the judgment in Renner vs. Reed was based — when the defendant is advised that he is proceeded against for a money demand, specific in amount and sworn to, and in a proceeding by attachment for service by seizure of property, we think it a sufficient notification to him of the nature of the complaint,‘to apprise him of the cause of action, and enable him to prepare his defence: more especially in view of our system of practice, which requires, that before any original writ shall issue, a declaration shall be first filed in the clerk’s office, there to remain, subject to the inspection of all parties. (Dig. Pr. Law sec .) And if the decision in Renner vs. Reed unavoidably led to the consequence of holding the writ bad in this case, upon the objection taken, which it does not, as we have seen, we would be more inclined to depart from that case and return to what we conceive to be the true spirit of the statute than to be governed by it. We think there is nothing in the other point made. Judgment affirmed.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862653,Mitchell vs. Gibson et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. This was a suit upon a bond given by the plaintiff in an action of forcible entry and detainer under the statute, and the other defendants in error, who were his securities. The bond was given, payable to the defendant in the action of forcible entry and detainer, and who is the present plaintiff, but it is conditioned strictly in accordance with the statute. The declaration makes profert of a true copy of the bond, alleging that the original is on file in the office of the clerk of the Circuit Court to which the writ of forcible entry and detainer was returnable, and not within the power or control of the plaintiff: and after setting out the bond and condition assigns for breach, that upon the execution of the bond, the sheriff proceeded to execute the writ by turning the.present plaintiff out, and putting the defendant, Gibson, in possession of the premises in question, and that such further proceedings were had in the action of forcible entry and detainer, that afterwards, to wit, &c., “said Gibson dismissed his said suit and abandoned and refused further to prosecute the same, whereupon by the consideration and judgment of the said court there,[a. judgment for costs was rendered in favor of said plaintiff herein against the said Gibson, and a writ of restitution awarded by said court, which costs amount to a large sum, to wit, the sum of --- dollars,” all of which would appear from the record thereof remaining, &c., and avers that the said defendant Gibson did not restore to the plaintiff the possession of the premises described, and did not, nor would pay the said plaintiff all such sums of money as were adjudged against him in said action, and so the condition of the bond was broken and the same became forfeited, &c. The plaintiff refusing to amend, after demurrer sustained to the declaration, final judgment went against him, from which he has appealed. The question is, as to the sufficiency of the declaration, to which various causes of demurrer were assigned in the court below, and some of which will be noticed. The statute, Digest, Title, Forcible Entry and Detainer, sec. , provides that the writ of possession shall not be executed in any case, unless the plaintiff or some other person in his behalf shall execute a bond to the sheriff or other person, in a sum at least double the value of the property specified in the writ, &c. The “other person” in the statute does not refer to the defendant in the action, but means that the bond shall be executed to the sheriff or other officer to whom the writ is directed, and who may be charged with its execution, as for instance, the coroner, or in extreme cases, the constable, where the offices both of sheriff and coroner happen to be vacant. Thompson vs. Bremage, at this term. See Digest, Title, Replevin, sec. , from which the section in question was, no doubt, intended to be copied. The defendant in the action of forcible entry and detainer might have had the bond produced by a rule upon the sheriff, and would not be bound to accept it, if essentially informal, variant from the statute, or defective in the condition, and might have obtained an order upon the plaintiff to furnish a sufficient bond, on paiii of having his suit dismissed with judgment of restitution. But the defendant in the action of forcible entry and detainer appears to have acquiesced in the form of the bond, and has signified his acceptance of it by the present suit. It does not lie in the mouth of the plaintiff in the action of forcible entry and detainer to question the sufficiency of the bond or its validity under the statute, nor ought they to be allowed to escape from it, if it can be upheld as. a common law obligation. It was executed to enable the principal to obtain possession of the property in controversy, and was a condition precedent to the execution of the writ: it was executed voluntarily and not under any duress, is not contrary to public policy or good morals, and not forbidden by any statute, or calculated to defeat its object. Nunn vs. Goodlett, Eng. . See authorities collected in Whitset vs. Womack, Ala. . The allegation that the bond sued upon is on file in the clerk’s office, and which is but inducement for the conclusion that is not within the power or control of the plaintiff, does not come up to the allegation in Nunn vs. Goodlett, that Hie bond was of record, and though confessed by the demurrer, does not show any sufficient excuse for not producing the original. The allegation that a paper is on file does not necessarily imply that it is so by authority of law, as to make it a record or a part of the record of any particular suit, unless from the character of the paper, the court would have to conclude that it was a matter of record. But if equivalent, this point was not noticed or decided in Nunn vs. Goodlett. The law has provided depositories for official bonds, and makes a certified copy, evidence in lieu of the original. So bonds for attachment and injunction, being prerequisites to the issuance of the writ, have to be filed with the clerk, so that if not technically and for all purposes a part of the record, of the particular suit or proceeding, they certainly are public records and in legal custody. Wilson vs. The State, Ark. . So delivery bonds are required to be returned with the execution, and become part of- the record as the foundation of ulterior proceedings. In none of those instances would the legal presumption be that the plaintiff had the right to the possession of the deed or instrument declared on; and though he ought to make proferí of an authenticated copy for the aid of the court, and the information of the opposite party, Adams vs. the State, Eng. , he is under no obligation to produce the original, which remains subject to the inspection of all persons intei’ested. ' But the bonds in replevin and forcible entry and detainer are not required to be returned and filed so as to become in any sense a part of the record, unless made so by some proceeding or exception taken during the progress of the cause. They are taken and held by the sheriff for the benefit of the defendant, and aré to be assigned to him, if judgment be rendered for him in the action. This assignment follows of course, and the court will order it as a matter of right on the application of the defendant, in case the sheriff should refuse. So that when the defendant brings suit on such a bond, it is in legal contemplation in his possession, or under his control. It may be lost or destroyed, or for some unusual cause, beyond his control, but this ought to be shown, and to the extent that profert is necessary, in ordinary cases, as an excuse for the omission. There is nothing in the case of Nunn vs. Goodlett which would dispense with a succinct and accurate statement of the judgment or recovery set forth in any assignment of breaches. Without enquiring as to the proper mode of making the averment which the decision in Butler vs. Owen, Eng. , misapprehending Caldwell vs. Bell & Graham, Ark. , has left in some confusion, the rules of pleading required that the plaintiff should set forth some certain amount adjudged to him for his costs, or if adjudged generally aver the amount under a vidclicit which would let in proof of the true amount to which the costs were afterwards taxed. Shelton vs. Clark, Eng. . As the property is immovable and the successful defendant can always be restored by-writ of restitution, his costs, and perhaps also the rents and profits accruing after judgment, if he does not choose to avail him- • self of the writ of restitution, under the construction given to the statute in Fowler vs. Knight, Eng. , constitute the gravamen of the, breach. From so much of that decision as holds that where the defendant succeeds he cannot have his damages assessed, but has his remedy upon the plaintiff’s bond, we are not now prepared to dissent further than to observe that, according to the condition of the plaintiff’s bond, it would seem the defendant can have no remedy upon it for any damages consequent upon eviction under the writ of possession, or the intermediate rents and profits, or even waste committed before judgment, unless recovered against the plaintiff in that action, so that the security afforded by the bond, is a mere delusion and the omission in the statute to provide for the assessment of damages, where the defendant has judgment of restitution, is one caliing for’ prompt remedy by the Legislature.

1862726,Moore vs. Burr,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the court. This was an action upon a protested bill of exchange. The issue upon the plea of non-assumpsit, was submittted to the court sitting as a jury, and as no question of law was raised on the trial, it would seem that the duly ascertained fact in the case isr that the defendant did not undertake or promise as alleged in the declaration. The plaintiff, however, has brought the case here upon exception to the overruling his motion in the court bel.ow for a new trial. The testimony, depositions and exhibits set out in the bill of exceptions, spread over near thirty pages of the record, the whole of which might have been condensed, on a case made for this court, so as to present the single question, argued here for the appellant, into the following statement of facts. Burr, a merchant of Batesville, having funds in the hands of Walton & Sheaffe, of New Orleans, drew a bill on them, which they accepted, and which came to the appellant by endorsement. The bill matured on the 17th May, , which being Sunday,, it was duly presented to the acceptors and protested for nonpayment on the 16th. The only proof of notice to the drawer is-that contained in the deposition of the notary, who states, “I ghve notice of such protest to the drawer by a letter addressed to him, bearing date the same day of the protest, and directed to him at Batesville, Arkansas, which letter I deposited in the post office, in the city of New Orleans, on the 18th day of May, , in time to go by the first mail thereafter.” There was no evidence as to the usual'times for departure of the mail. It does not appear at what hour, or whether any mail left New Orleans on Monday, by which the notice might have gone or at what time of that day the notice was deposited in the post office. Apart from the consideration that this court ought not to presume against the verdict of a jury, or the court sitting as a jury, but rather in favor of it, so far as it might depend on the weight or credibility of testimony, and regarding diligence as a question of law, and giving the appellant the full benefit of the legal questions, by supposing the evidence to be facts stated, the question would be whether the proof comes up to the mark of establishing due diligence. According to the rule adopted by this court in Davis vs. Hanly, Eng. , the holder was not obliged to deposit the notice in the post office on Monday in time to go by the mail of that day, if it went out too early to allow notice to be prepared conveniently within .business hours, but he had until a convenient hour of that day, for putting the notice into the office, and the first regui ar mail thereafter, though it did not go out until the succeeding or some subsequent day, would be the next convenient or practicable mail; and the law would hold this to be sufficient diligence on the part of the holder to charge the drawer. This is in accordance with the opinions of the court, in Lennox vs. Roberts, Wheaton , as qualified by the Bank of Alexandria vs. Swann, Peters , and with that qualification now generally recognized to be the correct rule, that “a demand of payment should be made upon the last day of grace, and notice of the default of the maker put into the post office, early enough to be sent by the mail of the succeeding day,” unless the mail of the succeeding 'day goes out at an unreasonably early or inconvenient hour. But the burthen of proof being on the plaintiff to show diligence, it follows as a necessary consequence of that rule that it is incumbent on him to prove such facts as will bring himself within it, Downs vs. The Planters Bank, S. & M. , else the result would be toleration of a different rule, that the holder or intermediate endorser receiving notice, had all of the succeeding day after protest or receipt of notice within which to deposit notice in the post office, so that it would be sufficient if it went out by the mail of the third day, which as we have seen, is not the rule adopted by this court, nor so far as we are aware, generally recognized, either in England or by the courts of this country. Diligence does not depend alone upon the fact of putting the notice in the post office in time to go by the mail of the day succeeding the protest, because, if no mail leaves on that day for the place to which the notice is directed, it would be sufficient to prove that it was deposited in the office on any subsequent day, in time to’ go by the first regular mail which left after the day of the protest. And under the qualified rule before stated and ad hered to by this court, the test of due diligence on the part of the holder is not merely the putting of the notice in the post office on the day succeeding the protest, unless coupled with the further proof that it was deposited in time to go by the mail of that day, if one left during convenient business hours, and if no mail left during those hours, then the presumption would follow, of course, in favor of diligence, that it was in time to go by the next regular mail after that day. But in the absence of any such proof in the power of the holder to make, the presumption would be against the exercise of due diligence unless departing from the rule, we adopt a different one, i.e., that the notice is sufficient if put into the office in time to go by the first mail which leaves on the second day after the protest. The like presumption to be indulged against the party whose duty it was to make out a case in proof, would have warranted the court below in inferring from the statement of the notary that he deposited the notice in the post office in time to go by the first mail that left after Monday, and not the first mail that left on Monday after the hour of putting the notice into the office; but upon the ground on which our decision rests, all such critical construction of his statement becomes unnecessary. The proof is insufficient, because it fails to show directly or by any fair inference that the notice was deposited in the post office in time to go by the first convenient mail, if any, which went out on Monday.

1862682,"State Bank vs. Walker, ad.","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court! It appears from the record in this case that Pope, the intestate, executed his note to the appellant, which became due on the 1st day of July, . That Pope died on the 20th day of July, , and administration of his estate was granted to the appellee on the 15th day of August following. The claim having been probated, was exhibited to the administrator oil the 29th day of April, , and rejected by him. The plaintiff filed the claim in the Probate Court on the 6th of July, , and on the next day, as shown by the record entry in the Probate Court, the parties appeared, and by consent it was ordered by the court, that the cause be continued until the next term. The cause was, at several subsequent terms, continued at the instance of the Bank, and upon her motion, successive writs of summons were sued out against the administrator, one of which was returned served on the 30th of July, , and at the October Term, , the parties appeared and the defendant entered his plea of the statate of limitations, to which the plaintiff joined issue, all in short by consent upon the record, and the court sitting as a jury, allowed the claim, and classed it in the 5th class, to which the defendant excepted, and on his appeal to the Circuit Court, the judgment was held to be erroneous, and atrial de novo awarded, in which on the same state of fact, the court found for the defendant on the issue between the parties and gave judgment accordingly, to which the appellant excepted. As heretofore held by this court, the appearance of the defendant, and his consenting to a continuance is a substantive act, dispensing with the service of process. Rogers vs. Conway, Ark. . The defendant must therefore be considered as having notice of the application for allowance to the Probate Court, and as being in court for all the purposes of the suit from that time forward. In the case of Etter vs. Finn, Eng. , it was the opinion of the court, that, though as a general rule, where a statute commences running, it continues to run until the bar becomes complete, such general rule had been qualified by this court upon the authority of the decisions in the courts of Maryland, Tennessee, North Carolina, Mississippi, and Alabama, as wouldbe seen by reference to the case of Aikin vs. Bailey, Eng. , where the death of aparty has been held to produce a temporary suspension of the operation of the statute, for then there are no parties competent to be sued. As for instance, if the payer of a note should die after the statute had commenced running, but before the statute bar had matured, the time between the death of such party, and the substitution of a new party, executor or administrator, would not be estimated in computing the time of the statute bar. If, therefore, we are to regard the plea of the statute of limitations interposed, in short, by the administrator’, as being the general statute of three years, the exceptions to the decision of the Circuit Court must be considered as well taken, because upon the facts proven, if the time between the death of the intestate and the grant of administration be excluded, three years had not elapsed from the accrual of the cause of action, until the institution of the suit ]oy the voluntary appearance of the administrator in the Probate Court, and in this view of the case, the judgment of the Circuit Court is erroneous. But the defendant could have the benefit of the general statute of limitations as a plea thus informally interposed, only on the supposition that the claim was barred by that statute before the death of his intestate. Because, although we have considered the case with reference to the decision in Etter vs. Finn, which was that upon the death of the debtor, the statute is suspended until the grant of letters, and then resumes its course, and have concluded that, even if governed by that decision, the defence is not sustained, yet in our opinion that case does not furnish the rule of decision. During the present term, in the case of Walker ad. vs. Byers, after a thorough examination of the subject, and a review of the previous decisions of this court touching the point, we have solemnly held that the two years statute of non-claim, gives the rule as to claims against the estates of deceased persons, and not the general statute of limitations; that is to say, that under our ad-, ministration system, as regulated by statute, when, a party dies, all subsisting claims against him, not then barred, are put on the same footing, and may be presented and allowed against his estate, at any time within two years from the grant of letters, and if not presented within that time are barred, without any saving or exception in favor of disabilities, and without reference to the length of time such claims might have had to run as against living persons under the general statute. When we apply this rule to the facts of this case, it is beyond question that the claim was not barred; because the administrator appeared in the Probate Court on the 7th of July, , and within two years from the grant of letters, to resist the allowance and classification; he having rejected the claim when it was presented to him duly authenticated on the 29th of April following. The judgment of the Circuit Court must therefore be reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions to affirm the judgment of the Probate Court.

1862702,Beirne & Burnside vs. Imboden et al. admr.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. It appears from,, the transcript that at the July term, , of the Probate Court of Randolph county, this cause originally came on to be heard “ in the matter of the presentation to the court by Beirne and Burnside, of a claim for allowance and classification against” the defendants, as administrators of the estate of Thomas O. Man*, deceased: And that, when the claimants offered to read in evidence the promissory note on which the claim for allowance was founded, the defendants objected, and moved the court to enter a judgment of non-suit against the claimants, because the claim in question had not been properly authenticated and presented for allowance, which motion the court granted, and adjudged costs against the claimants. The claimants took a bill of exceptions, and appealed to the Circuit Court for Randolph county, and at the May term, , the latter court, the cause having been heard on this bill of exceptions, and an assignment of the supposed error of the Probate-Court, the judgment was affirmed with costs; and the cause has been brought here by writ of error. It appears from the bill of exceptions that the note offered in evidence was as follows, to-wit: “ $ . New Orleans, December 20th, . Six months after date, we, or either of us, promise to pay to the order of Beirne & Burnside, eight hundred and seventy-two dollars and sixty-four cents, for value received. J. M. SHEPPERD, THOS. O. MARR.” And attached to it was an affidavit in the following words,,to-wit : STATE OF ARKANSAS,) County of Randolph. ) I, Thomas M. Cory, do solemnly swear that nothing has been-paid or delivered towards the satisfaction of the above demand,, except what has been credited thereon, and that the sum of eight hundred and seventy-two dollars and sixty-four cents, principal, and seventy-five dollars and sixty-one cents interest, above demanded is justly due. THOMAS M. CORY. Sworn to and subscribed before me, J. W. James, an acting Justice of the Peace, this 18th day of July, . J. W. JAMES, J. P.

Marr, deceased. Filed September 2d, . B. F. PAYNE, Clerk, By W. S. Walker, Deputy Clerk'. It also appears by the transcript of the proceedings of the Probate Court, that the cause was twice continued in that court by “consent of parties,” before it was finally heard and determined there; and upon the latter ground it is insisted here that the want of authentication (if this court should hold the affidavit insufficient) was matter in abatement; and therefore the motion for non-suit, after these continuances, was out of time. In the case of Ryan et al. vs. Lemon ad. ( Eng. R. ) this court concluded upon this point that this objection and motion might be made at any time prior to final judgment, and at the present term, in the case of Walker ad. vs. Byers, we have held that the objection, for want of authentication, might be taken either by plea, on motion, or by way of objection to the admissibility of evidence offerred to establish the claim. There is therefore, nothing in this objection. Another question, however, is directly raised upon this record, and it is the only remaining one involved in the cause; and that is, as to the sufficiency of the authentication. The promissory note, on which the claim is founded, is payable to Beirne & Burnside. It does not appear to have been endorsed to any one, and the proceedings for its exhibition are in their name, while the affidavit, in due form, as provided by the statute, appears to be made by Thomas M. Cory. Is this such an authentication as is contemplated by the statute ? The authority of the Legislature to enact the law, requiring one who has a claim against the estate of a deceased person to authenticate his claim by his own affidavit, before evidence shall be heard to sustain it, may be safely assumed. There can be no pretence that such a regulation cuts off all remedy, or that it clogs it in any such degree, even upon small demands in favor of distant creditors, as to be obnoxious to the objection that the obligation of the contract is thereby impaired within the meaning of the constitution. Although the cost of an affidavit might be greater than the amount of the claim authenticated thereby, it would be no more onerous upon the claimant to advance the amount than it would be to advance the cost of a writ in an ordinary proceeding, when his claim might be less than the cost of the writ. No constitutional question then will be considered as involved in the point that we are to determine. And there is no question as to whether or not this is such a claim as is required by the statute to be authenticated, as there was in the case of Walker ad. vs. Byers. Nor is any question presented whether, when there are joint claimants, the affidavit of one of them only sufficiently authenticates the claim. The precise question here is, whether the affidavit of Cory, who does not appear as a claimant at all, is sufficient authentication within the provisions of the statute. It is insisted.that by a fair and sensible construction, the affidavit of any one, who can make it truly from his own knowledge of the facts, would be sufficient authentication, whether it be that of the creditor,'or one of them, or his or their agent, or attorney, or other person, or at any rate if it be that of the agent, or attor- ney. It may be remarked in the first place that so much has been expressed by the Legislature on the point, in an unambiguous manner, that but little is left to be interpreted; and that little must necessarily be interpreted in direct reference to the general policy of our administration system; of which the enactments in. question constitute a part. All claims are to be barred unless exhibited properly authenticated,” within the two years specified (Dig. p. , sec. ;) Both exhibition and authentication are the creatures of the statute, and are alike applicable to all claims, and the latter is a prerequisite of the former, whether the exhibition be the act of the parties or by means of a proceeding, either on the law or chancery side of the Circuit or in the Probate Court. Executors or administrators have to authenticate their own. claims against the estates committed to their hands by the “same affidavit required of other claimants,” (sec. ). Actions pending against any person at the time of his death, which survive against his executor or administrator, are considered as exhibited without authentication, (sec. ). When a claim is exhibited by the act of the party out of court, the “ claimant shall append to his demand an affidavit.” (sec. ). When he exhibits by means of a proceeding in court, the affidavit must be produced, and it must appear to have been made prior to the commencement of the proceeding, (sec. ). The general form of this required affidavit is prescribed, (sec. ), and when authentication is made in behalf of a corporation, or by an executor, administrator, or assignee, a special affidavit prescribed, is declared to be sufficient, (sec. ). The officers, before whom affidavits are to be made in this State, are specified, and provisions are made for their authentication, when made beyond the limits of the State, (sec. ). Persons who swear falsely in making the required affidavit are declared guilty of perjury, (sec. ). When a debt is due to a corporation, the cashier or treasurer is to make the affidavit, (sec. ). If the debt be assigned after the debtor’s death, the authentication is to be made by means of both the affidavit of the person, who held the debt at the death of the debtor, as well as that of the assignee superadded, the one in the general, the other in the special form prescribed, (sec. , ), and it is in express terms provided that “ before any executor or administrator shall pay or allow any debt demanded as due from the deceased, the person claiming such debt shall make an affidavit, as aforesaid,” (sec. ). And there are several other provisions touching exhibition and authentication, which, when all considered together, seem clearly enough to show that the Legislature used as synonymous the terms, “ creditor” and “ claimant,” and the terms debt, claim and demand. There is much light thrown upon the question at issue, by these various provisions, affirmative and negative, general and special. Perhaps, however, it is not necessary to look beyond the provisions of sections , , and , when considered together, andin generalreferencejonly to the policy of our administrative system, to solve satisfactorily the point to be determined. If it had been designed that the affidavit of the agent or attorney of the creditor should authenticate the claim under any circumstances, the provisions made for the authentication of a claim on the part of a corporation, would* have been totally unnecessary. So, if it had been designed that the affidavit of any person whomsoever, whether the creditor or his agent, or attorney, who could make the affidavit truly from his own knowledge of the facts, should be' sufficient authentication, neither the provisions as to corporations, nor those as to assignees would have been necessaiy, because, in the case of a corporation creditor, a knowledge of the facts on which the affidavit would be based, necessarily lay in some natural person, who was not in contemplation of law the creditor; and in the case of claims assigned after the death of the debtor, such knowledge would, in general, lay either in the holder of the debt at the time of the death, or of some other person, not the- assignee. Because, as to the assignee, it could not be possible, in contemplation of law, that any thing could have been paid on the debt after the death of the debtor, and before its exhibition ; and any knowledge as to the original consideration, or of its failure, either before or during this interval, would, in general, be better known to some other person than the assignee. So, also against the idea that any person may make the affidavit whose knowledge of the facts would enable him to do it truly, and in such case the affidavit of the creditor may be dispensed with, it is apparent, from this provision in reference to corporations, executors, administrators and assignees, when those made in reference to the latter are contrasted with those in reference to the other three, that an affidavit is more readily dispensed with from a third person, who could make it positively upon his own knowledge, than from the creditor himself, who could only make it on belief from information. When then considering together the provisions of the four sections we have grouped, in their connection with our administration system and in direct reference to its policy, we think it perfectly clear that the Legislature has not only enacted affirmatively as a general rule, that the creditor in person must authen j ticate his claim by his own affidavit, but that rule is re-affirmed by inevitable inferences from the provisions as to corporations, exeeutors, administrators and assignees, which constitute the exceptions to, and limit and qualify this general rule as to who shall authenticate, and the mode of authentication. This we conceive to be the true interpretation of the enactment in question, and it is in accordance both with the letter and the spirit of the statute. And nothing is to be inferred against it from the form of the affidavit prescribed ; which is evidently but a general form, applicable in its precise terms to debts at maturity, upon which there may be credits endorsed, and is, of course, to be often varied in its terms, so that the substance is preserved, to correspond withucases where the debt may 'not have matured —may have no credits — when the claim may sound in damages, (Dig. p. , sec. ), or he uncertain in amount, for want of the settlement of complicated accounts, sought by proceedings in court to be settled; in which latter cases the party could only swear to the best of his knowledge and belief to some specified amount of damage or balance due him. It but remains to be said that we are of opinion that the supposed authentication in this case was insufficient, and finding n,o error in the record the judgment must be«affirmed.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862657,McMorrin ad. &c. vs. Overholt,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. At the July term, , of the Probate Court of Pulaski county, the following proceedings appear to have been had : “ On this day the claim of W. R. Overholt, against the estate of B. J. McHenry, deceased, amounting to the sum of $ , allowed by the administratrix, and filed herein for classification, on the st day of July, . was taken up, and upon examination thereof, it is ordered by the court that said claim be placed in class number four.” At the January term, , of the same court, Overholt filed his petition, praying that McMorrin, who had, in the meantime, become administrator de íonis non, should show cause why he should not pay said claim, so allowed and classed. In response to a rule against him, that went out accordingly, McMorrin appeared and set up by way of resistance to the application of Overholt for an order of payment', first, that the claim had never been legally allowed by the former administrator, as the record purported: and secondly, that at the time of the death of the intestate, Overholt was indebted to him for divers sums of money specified, and for boarding, &c., and introduced testimony on both points, against the objection of Overhojt, The Probate Court, however, made the order of payment for a pro-rata amount in favor of Overholt, and McMorrin filed his bill of exceptions and appealed to the Circuit Court, where the doings of the Probate Court were affirmed, and taking his bill of exceptions there also, he appealed to this court. We have thus stated so much of the mass of matters contained in the transcript (much of which has little or no relation to the order of payment, which alone is questioned by the exceptions taken), as to show distinctly the points of law involved. We think the action of the Circuit Court was clearly right. The allowance and classification of the claim in question, whether right or wrong, had become so fixed by the action of the Probate .Court, that all inquiry as to either was closed after , the expiration of the term at which it was had, otherwise than by a direct proceeding for reversal (Dooley et al. vs. Watkins, Ark. R. . Cossitt vs. Biscoe, Eng. R. . Borden et al. vs. State, use &c., Eng. R. ). The application for an order of payment was substantially an application for process of execution, to which the alleged matter of set-off was no answer. Payment of the claim allowed and classed was not pretended. There is no error in the record. Judgment affirmed.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862690,Walker as ad. vs. Byers,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. This cause was brought here from the chancery side of the Independence Circuit Court, on the separate appeal of Walker. The original bill was filed on the 13th day of March, , by Ichabod M. Manning, against Walker, as administrator of James Pope deceased, and against William Byers : alleging that a certain partnership, which he particularly set out, had existed between himself, Byers and Pope, in his lifetime, from the 12th of February, , when it was formed, until the 24th of March, , when it was dissolved by mutual consent, and when an account, which he to some extent set out, was stated between the partners, and the assets of the concern turned over to Pope and Byers to reduce to money, and pay towards the partnership liabilities, and account for the balance, if any, and praying an account and a decree for whatever sum should be found due to him, against Byers and Walker, as administrator of Pope, the latter having departed this life about the middle of July, , soon after which time Walker administered upon his estate. Byers answered, admitting many of the material facts, and ex j hibiting very fully and particularly the alleged stated account, at the time of the dissolution, all the liabilities of the firm, and its assets of every description, and the manner in which they had been disposed of, and showing a considerable loss upon the whole transaction, alleged that he was the sufferer, and prayed relief against both Manning and Walker, as administrator. Walker, as administrator, answered also, denying all personal knowledge of any of the matters stated in the bill, refusing to admit any thing, and requiring strict proof, prayed to be dismissed with his reasonable costs. Issues having been formed and depositions taken, the cause first came on to be heard at the June term, , when, an account was decreed, and the matters referred to the master. At the March term, , the master reported, and at the same term Byers filed his cross bill, to which Walker interposed by answer, the failure of Byers to authenticate his supposed claim, as provided by the statute; the special statute of non-claim, and the general statute of limitation, and denying the allegation, and requiring strict proof, prayed again to be discharged with his reasonable costs. Manning also answered the cross bill, and issues having been formed, the entire cause was heard at the September term, , and the court not being sufficiently advised what decree to render, took time to consider until the 12th of January following, when at a special adjourned session, a final decree was rendered in favor of Byers, against Manning, and against Walker, as administrator, from which the latter appealed to this court. From the foregoing statement of the case, it will be observed that the original bill of Manning was filed about six years after the dissolution of the partnership, and about one year and a half after the, grant of letters of administration to Walker, on the estate of Pope. This original bill was not sworn to. Pope died about four years and four months after the dissolution of the partnership, and Walker 'administered upon his estate about six months afterwards. The answer of Byers to the original bill of Manning, was filed about five days before the expiration of two years from the granting of letters of administration to Walker. This answer was sworn to in the usual manner. The cross bill of Byers was not sworn to, and it was filed above four years after the grant of letters of administration. The decree appealed from is that rendered by the court below, against Walker, as administrator, and we shall first enquire' whether or not that decree was authorized by the cross bill. We shall do so, because in the solution of that question we shall at once get at the real point of law involved in the case. To the cross bill, it will be remembered Walker interposed, by his answer, the three fold defence, that the alleged claim of Byers was not authenticated against him as administrator, in the manner provided by the statute, and was barred both by the general statute of limitations, and by the special statute of non-claim. The consideration of this defence necessarily brings up several important questions, growing out of the statutory regulations touching the settlement and disposition of the estates of deceased persons, and the rights of those having claims touching an estate, either as creditor or otherwise. Some of these questions have not heretofore been fully considered, and upon some isolated points of the general doctrines involved, two or three of the decisions of this court have tended to confuse, rather than to elucidate the points of law involved in the case before us. We shall, therefore, in the course of our observations upon these questions, incidentally notice these decisions, and give to them such explanation and qualification as may be necessary. When one dies and leaves an estate, what claims against it does the statute contemp] ate shall be authenticated by affidavit, in the manner pointed out by its provisions ? And what is the true statute rule as to limitations? Does the general statute of limitations give the rule? or does the special statute of non-claim, or both combined ? Or the one or the other, at the election of the representative of the estate? These are the questions raised by the decree appealed from, if it is to be considered as based upon the cross bill; and in that light, as we have already said, we shall first consider whether it can be sustained. In order to arrive at a correct conclusion on any of these points, it would be very unsafe to rely upon any particular provision only of the statute, that might seem to relate directly to the particular point to be determined, much less upon any more minute ground of the mere phraseology of such particular provision ; because it seems perfectly clear when our numerous statutory provisions, touching the estates of deceased persons (all in response to our constitutional provision, on the same subject), are considered together,that the Legislature did not design merely to amend the old laws touching the subject, but to create and set bn foot a new and complete system, which would necessarily jnake radical changes in the law as applicable to living persons. In proceeding to this extent, our Legislature has done but little more than to arrange and fix in a permanent system, applicable to all estates of deceased persons, whether solvent or insolvent, principles of equity, and of public policy, that in other States had been often applied to the settlement of estates only that were insolvent, or settled by a resort to equity courts, and elsewhere in the common law had been applied in' the settlement of claims in rem in general. Beyond this, however, and in combination with these principles, our Legislature has incorporated into this system a safe guard against fraudulent claims, and against collusion, between fraudulent claimants, and the representative of estates in requiring an affidavit from every claimant, which contemplates not only the protection of the just creditor but the distributee. And indeed, the last remark, as to the distributee, is applicable to the whole machinery of our administration system, which, in hedging out the evils of delay so inseparably connected with the settlement and distribution of estates, under the old law, as well as in all its other main objects, looks not alone to the interest of creditors, but has regard also to the interests of the heirs, or distributees, who are often minors, dependant upon the residue of the estate for support and education. In this system two capital objects seem plainly in view from the various provisions for their attainment; first, that the estate of every deceased person after death, shall immediately pass to the custody of the law, to be administered for the benefit of creditors, and after the satisfaction of all claims against it, that shall be presented within two years after the grant of letters testamentary, or of administration, the residue shall in the next place be passed to the heir, or distributee, quit of all claims against it, which the law will allow of, as against an executor, or administrator. The Probate Court is intrusted with this custody of estates, and that tribunal proceeds in rem to adjust the right of all persons interested in an estate; and disposes of it in accordance with the provisions of the statute,'having for these purposes the most summary and plenary powers within the scope of its jurisdiction, conferred by the constitution and the statutes, administering both law and equity within this scope, according to the exigency of the right to be adjudicated upon. In this process in rem, the executor, or administrator is very nearly identical with the assignee in bankruptcy. In his name, all rights, both against and in favor of the esl ate, are for the purposes of settlement and distribution, to be asserted in this tribunal and elsewhere. In such a system, with a tribunal thus constituted, as its effective instrument, we think it clear that the claims and demands which the statute contemplates shall be exhibited to the executor, or administrator in the manner provided by the statute, before the end of two years from the granting of letters, on pain of being forever barred, are all claims capable of being asserted in any court of justice, either of law or equity, existing either at the time of the death of the deceased, or coming into existence at any time after the death, and before the expiration of the two years — including, of course, all claims, or demands, running to certain maturity, although not yet payable, to be adjusted presently, upon equitable principles of discount according to the rate of interest when matured, or to be provided for at the day of maturity without discount, and excluding such claims only as might be inchoate and contingent, like that in the case of Burton vs. Lockhart, ( Eng. R. ), and like dormant warranties, broken by eviction after the expiration of the two years. In excluding such possible claims, indicated in the latter class, the statute does not destroy them, only as against any administrator, or executor, and in preferring to them all claims that exist at the death, or come into existence at any time before the expiration of the two years, and therefore leaves them to be asserted against the heir, or distributee, as such, as a superior equity to his, in the assets that may have descended to, or been distributed to him after the estate of a deceased person has been .administered for all the purposes contemplated by law. Whereas every species of claim or demand, either legal or equitable, which comes within the scope of the administration, as we have defined it, will be forever barred, as well against the heir or distributee, as the executor or administrator, if not exhibited in the manner provided by the statute, by the end of the two years. From this exposition of our administration system, and we can reasonably come to no other conclusion, than that this is the true one contemplated by the Legislature; it results that where one dies and leaves an estate, every claim or demand against it, for which it is liable, when in the course of administration, in whatever manner asserted, must be authenticated by the affidavit of the claimant, as provided by the statute, because in no other way can a claim be exhibited, in accordance with the statute, to prevent its being forever barred. To this general rule, however, the statute itself points out one exception — that of a suit pending against any person at the time of his death, which, by law survives against his executor or administrator, and although this express exception might seem to exclude all other by a common rule of interpretation, there are doubtless other exceptions, as for instance all proceedings on the part of the widow, for dower: which are grounded on a right in the property itself, out of which she is to get her estate of dower; proceedings for specific performance of a contract which do not seek to diminish the assets, that the law takes into custody — scire facias, to revive a judgment against an executor or administrator, because, such revival does not operate to exhibit the judgment revived, affidavit being nevertheless required, when it might be presented for allowance and classification. Nor need this enumeration of exceptions exclude the idea of other possible cases, that might not interfere with the policy of the statute. This provision of the statute, requiring the. authentication of all claims against the estate of a deceased person, as a pre-requisite of their exhibition in some one of the modes pointed out by the statute — 'and unless exhibited they can never be lawfully satisfied out of the estate taken into the custody of the law to be administered — could always be evaded at the election of the executor or administrator, if a failure to plead the want of the authentication was a waiver of it, because of the provision of the 170th section of the administration act, which provides that “No executor or administrator, or the security of any executor or administrator, shall be made liable for more than the amount of assets of the testator or intestate, on account of having failed to plead or make defence, or on account of any omission to plead, or mistake in pleading, or false pleading of any such executor or administrator;” and therefore, it could not have been designed by the Legislature, that the want of authentication should be set up in no other manner than by way of a plea. Such an idea would be directly at war with so much of the design of the Legislature, as related to collusion between a fraudulent creditor and the representative of an estate, because, whenever the representative might desire to facilitate a fraudulent creditor, he would either turn him over to the Circuit GoUrt in the first instance, or reject his claim, to give him an opportunity to go to the Probate Court, and in either case fail to plead the want of authentication without responsibility to himself or his securities, and thus defeat so much of the policy of the law. It must, therefore, have been the intention of the Legislature to have sustained the policy of the law by some means beyond the mere interposition of the objection by means of a plea or motion, and cumulative of this means. If the entire 170th section of the administration act, which we have above copied, be held to apply strictly to matters of defence, by means of the pleadings, which, we think was clearly intended, and that the provision as to authentication, was designed to work such a change in the law, as to make all evidence inadmissible, to sustain a claim against the estate of deceased persons, until it had been first authenticated, as provided by the statute ; then, in case the objection had not been properly interposed by a plea or motion, it would be the duty of the executor or administrator, for the performance of which he and his securities would be responsible, to insist on the objection, by way of an objection to the admissibility of any evidence offered to sustain the claim, until it should be first made to appear, on the part of the claimant, that his claim had been duly authenticated before the commencement of the suit in which the evidence was offered. This would place him and his securities upon the same footing as to responsibility, as if under the provisions of sections , , , , &c., of the administration law, (Dig. , & ), he had by his owp act out of court, allowed a claim without authentication. Accordingly we adopt this construction of the statute, and the consequence is that even in a case where the contract is in writing, and as against a living person, when the foundation of a suit, could be read in evidence without proof of its execution, unless denied by sworn plea, as provided by the statute, it could not yet be read in evidence, (even if its execution were proven, as at common law), in a suit in the Circuit or Probate Court, against an executor or administrator, until the authentication had been made to appear of a date before the commencement of the suit, in which it might be offered in evidence. The next question we are to consider is as to the true statute rule operating upon claims against the estates of deceased persons. Does the general statute of limitations give the rule, or the statute of non-claim, or both in combination? As all ■claims, not exhibited within two years from the granting of the letters, are to be forever barred, it follows that however long a claim may have to run under the general statute, it cannot sustain it even one day beyond the end of the two years, and therefore, it is that to this extent at least, the general statute of limitations is displaced by the special statute of non-claim, because of the inconsistency of the two rules, unless the latter could come in like a proviso and cut the former down. And if, in the onward course of the general statute of limitation, it would run out on a given claim the same day that the two years would expire, which would be a case in principle like where the general statute was cut down by way of such a proviso as that supposed, one or the other would be useless, because they would both perform the same office in sustaining the claim in full life, if it be true, that both are applicable. But it is not true in such a case that they both perform the same office, because the claim is sustained in full life, not because an action was commenced upon it, within a certain time after an action accrued, but because it was exhibited before the end of two years after the granting of letters. If it had not been exhibited within this two years, it would have been barred, however short the time since an action had accrued, or although no action at all had accrued, upon a debt not yet due, but running to certain maturity. It would seem then clear enough that, in such a case as this also, the rule of the general statute of limitation was displaced by the rule of the special statute of non-claim, because the former could be of no use at all to either party, there being no place left for its operation, either in itself or in combination with the special statute of non-claim. It has been supposed, however, that where the general statute runs out before the expiration of the two years, it might operate as well as the special statute of non-claim, because there would be then some place left for its operation that would not be inconsistent with the operation of the latter, and therefore it may be relied upon at the election of the executor or administrator. This idea is founded upon a misconception of the true nature, and the true rule of the statute of non-claim, and in consequence assumes as true, what is not true, in supposing any place is left, even in this case, for the operation of the rule of the g eneral statute. The statute of non-claim is itself but a statute of limitation, and is nothing else. The most plainly marked distinction, that has ever been drawn between them by the adjudged cases, was that the executor or administrator was bound to plead the statute of non-claim, but could plead the general statute of limitation or not at his election. And this was based upon the ground that statutes of non-claim were for the benefit of estates, and of creditors and heirs, interested in them, and that the executor or administrator was a trustee"" for them. But even this distinction may be challenged as sound law, the learning upon which it is based being as well applicable to the general statute of limitation as to the special statute of non-claim, and is parcel .of the exploded idea, that an executor or administrator may revive a debt against his testator or intestate, by a part payment, pr an express new promise at least, which grew up under a theory, that regarded the executor as the owner of the estate, and responsible not only to the extent of assets, but to a greater extent, if he did not show in defence that he had fully administered, ,and therefore cannot be tolerated in a system where, for most purposes, he is regarded only as trustee, or assignee, and cannot bind the estate by any contract of his own, and where nothing short of a contract by the party to be boupd, can revive a cause of action barred by the statute of limitation. But while the nature of the two statutes is identical, the rule given by each is essentially different. The one bars causes of action, if the suit be not commenced within a given time after accrual; the other, having a wider scope, bars all claims and demands, without regard to the time of accrual of the cause of action, if not exhibited within a fixed period of time. The statute of non-claim is like the statute of limitations that existed in early times in England; before the first general or prospective statute, in being temporary, and in running off from a fixed point of time; as from the first landing of 'King Richard, the 1st, and not unlike our earlier pre-emption laws. In both instances the experience under the operation of the temporary enactment proving the good policy of prospective and permanent enactment- As a mere statute of limitations then, giving a rule of limitation which rums, not from the accrual of the cause of action, but from the granting of the letters, if the general statute still operated there would be two limitations operating at the same time upon the same demand, one of which was founded on policy, which had been itself entirely displaced by the substitution of a new system, designed by direct means to effect at once the very object that the policy overthrown sought to achieve, by means of stimulating, merely, speedy settlement between debtor and cre^ ditor. This system, assuming to make all such settlements at once upon the death of any deceased person, and forthwith taking the custody of all available assets, calls for the exhibition of all subsisting claims, upon pain that all such shall be forever barred, if not exhibited by the expiration of the two years from the granting of the letters, and staying all process in the courts, except such as shall be needful for the exhibition of demands. In effect regarding the whole period, from the time of the death to the expiration of the two yeai’s from the granting of letters, as a single point of time, for purposes of exhibition of claims subsisting at the time of the death, or which may come into existence at any time before the expiration of the two years. Under such circumstances, to suppose there was any place left for the operation of the general statute of limitations, would be to suppose that a rule based upon a particular reason could properly have operation in a case without the reason, or could exist where the reasons on which it rested had no longer existence.And if this was not so, all that policy of our administration system,which looks to the speedy settlement of estates, that distributees and legatees may, as soon as practicable, be placed in the enjoyment of their rights in the residue, would, in general, be entirely overthrown. We therefore think-this court was correct in coming to the conclusion, in the case of Erwin, use vs. Turner, surviving admr. ( Eng. R. ), that the general statute of limitations was designed to operate upon the rights of parties while living, and was not designed to apply after death to claims against the estates of deceased persons, the statute of non-claim, as to such estates, giving the rule of limitation, and was wrong in holding the contrary, in the case of Etter vs. Finn, as admr., 7th English R. . Although the principle, for which the case of Aiken vs. Baily ( Eng. R. ), was cited as authority in that case, is undoubtedly sound, and is applicable not only to the general statute of limitation, but also to the statute of non-claim, in a proper case, as where the first administrator might die, or resign within the two years, and some time might elapse before a second administrator should be appointed, the time during which there was actually no administrator, would not be computed as a part of the two years. We think that this court was also wrong in holding, in the cases of Burton, admr. vs. Lockhert, executor, Eng R. , and in Allen vs. Byers, admr. ( Eng. R. ), that the statute of non-claim runs from the accrual of the cause of action upon the claims respectively. In the first case the claim sprung into existence from a dormant and contingent state, some time after the expiration of the two years from the grant of letters, and was therefore bdrred forever, as against an executor or administrator, and could only have been asserted, as against the heir or distributee, to be satisfied out of any residue of estate descended or distributed. The second case was where a security had paid a debt after the expiration of the two years, and was consequently a claim of the same description. If, however, he had paid the debt and exhibited his claim before the expiration of the two years, it would have been entitled to share against the estate as other claims exhibited in due time. The authorities, upon which the latter decision was based, were from States whose administration systems differ from ours in taking the assets of an estate into the custody of the law, only in cases where the.estate is insolvent, and where the statute of non-claim is not construed as displacing the general statute of limitations as to claims not arrived at maturity. In the light of these views then, it is clear that the decree in this case cannot be sustained upon the cross bill of Byers, because there is no pretence either that the cross bill was sworn to, or that it was filed, until long after the expiration of two years from the grant of letters of administration to Walker. This first view of the case at bar having made it necessary that we should examine the doctrines discussed in order to determine the two points settled, we will remark before proceeding to the next view, as they are questions of some importance, that we have examined them with care, and have not determined them until after considering their probable consequences. And in these we see no probable evils at all to be weighed against the manifest good to be achieved by stimulating the speedy settlement of estates, in accordance with the unmistakable spirit of our administration system, palpably manifest. In the next place, Byers insists, that as his answer to the original bill of Manning against himself and Walker, as administrator, was duly sworn to; was filed before the end of the two years from the granting of the letters, contained all the material matters subsequently set up in the cross bill, and was sustained by' the proofs, that therefore the decree in his favor against his co-defendant, Walker, can well rest upon these pleadings and proof,, irrespective of the cross bill, under the rule, which under certain-circumstances, allows of decrees over between co-defendants, or of cross decrees between them, founded upon the justice and: equity of the whole case. Such a practice is allowable when such cross decrees can rest upon the matters stated in the bill, and admitted by the defendant, sought to be changed by his' co-defendant, either by suffering the bill to be taken as confessed, or by direct admissions in his answer."" But no case is cited that goes the length of allowing a decree in favor of a defendant against his co-defendant, on matters stated in the answer of the defendant, in whose favor the decree is rendered, which the defendant decreed against, had no opportunity to respond to by pleading and evidence, as he would have had if thosfe matters had been stated in the original bill. And this is precisely the state of the case before us, and although Byers was entitled to a decree against the plaintiff, Manning, for any balance found in his favor, upon the settlement of the accounts which he had demanded by his bill, because by this demand of a settlement of accounts, he thereby gave a pledge that he would submit to a decree for any balance found against him. (Hood & Wife vs. Lee, Monroe's R. at p. ). There was no-such pledge, either express or implied, between Walker, as administrator, and Byers, and Walker had no opportunity to respond to any other than the matters stated in the bill, while the-decree against him is founded upon the matters stated in the answer of Byers, to which he had no opportunity to responds The general rule is distinctly stated to be (Daniel's Ch. Pr. 3d vol. p. ), that “ one defendant cannot have a decree against a co-defendant without a cross bill, with proper prayer and process, or answer, as in an original suit,” and a defendant can, in general, pray for nothing in his answer but to be dismissed the court. If he has any relief to pray for, he must do so by a bill of his own, or by answer in the nature of a cross bill, under the provisions of the statute, Calhoun vs. Erwin, Ala. R. . Cummins’ heirs vs. Gill’s heirs, 6th Ala. R. ; Morehead vs. Prater and Smiley, Bibbs R. ; Shelby & Roberts vs. Smith’s heirs, A. K. Marshall’s R. ; Talbot vs. McGee, Monroe R. ), and if he seeks such relief against a co-defendant, by this statutory means, he must, after answering the original bill, proceed to charge his co-defendant as he would by a regular cross bill, and take steps to get his answer, because otherwise, although it might be in the nature of a cross bill, as against the complainant, it would not be as against his co-defendant, (Talbot vs. McGee, Monroe, , Shelby & Robertson vs. Smith’s heirs, A. K. Marsh. R. .) But in this case, if Byers had shown himself to be within any exception to the general rule, thus laid down, so as to be entitled to a decree against his co-defendant, Walker, upon the pleadings and evidence, his decree against Walker could not be sustained, because it would have neither pleadings or evidence to rest upon. The bill of Manning was not sworn to, and although Walker might be considered as having waived this objection as to him, by reason of his never having in any way taken this specific objection to the proceedings by him, he cannot be supposed to have waived it as-to Byers, either as to the pleadings or the evidence, because, in resisting the only apparent effort of Byers to seek a decree against him as administrator, he expressly interposes this specific objection, which in all fairness should avail him, as well when Byers falls back upon the bill of Manning to sustain his decree to any extent, as when he relies upon his own cross bill. When then he is allowed the benefit of the objection to this extent, it cuts out the bill of Manning as- to Byers, and with it falls Byers’ answer, which is a dependancy, and even if the pleadings were not thus overthrown, all the evidence in the entire case was, as in favor of Byers and against Walker, incompetent as to Walker, in the face of his specific objection, for want of authentication standing in the record, and insisted upon at the hearing. The decree then against Walker, as administrator, cannot be sustained, either upon the cross bill, or upon the pleadings and evidence in the original suit of Manning. It is therefore unnecessary for us to examine Walker’s third ground of defence, which is that the claim for an account against him as administrator, was not a subsisting claim or demand at the death of his intestate, for the alleged reason, that it was then barred by the lapse of time, within the doctrines applied during the present term of this court in the case of Adams, admr. vs. Creed Taylor. We are of opinion, therefore, that so much of the decree of the court below, as is against the appellant Walker, as administrator, ought to be reversed and held for nought, that the bill and cross bill, as to him, ought to be dismissed,, and that he should recover his cost. Let this be done and this cause remanded to the court from whence it came with instructions so to reform the decree of that court, that all of it that now appeal’s either against the appellant severally, or against him jointly with Manning, may be set aside and held for nought, and the residue of the decree be so formed that it may stand and be executed as a several decree against Manning.

1862656,State use Perryman vs. Stephens et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court. The action in this case was brought upon the official bond of a sheriff, against himself and his securities. After setting out the bond with its conditions, the plaintiff avers that Nancy Perry-man, for whose use the suit is brought, commenced her action in replevin for slaves, against William Drew in the Sebastian Circuit Court, and sued out her writ of replevin, which, whilst in full force, was placed in the hands of the qualified deputy of said Stephens, who was then sheriff of Sebastian county, by which he was commanded that if the said Nancy Perryman should give security as required by law, that he cause said slaves to be replevied and delivered to her; that said sheriff did, whilst said writ was in full force, by his deputy, take said slaves by virtue thereof into his possession. And the plaintiff then alleges, as a breach of the official duty of said sheriff that he refused to take bond and security as required by law, from said Nancy Perryman; but fraudulently intending to injure and cheat her out of the negroes, delivered them to said Drew. The second count is in all respects like the first, with this difference, that it is alleged for a breach, that said sheriff, by his deputy, took the slaves into possession, by virtue of said writ, but would not, and did not take bond from the said Nancy Perryman as required by law, and wholly failed and refused to do so. To this declaration a demurrer was filed, the ground of which was, that the breach assigned in each is insufficient in this, that it was not sufficient to aver that the sheriff refused to take a bond, fyc., or that he would not take such bond, or did not take it, but that in order to charge the sheriff for a breach of official duty, it was necessary to aver that the said Nancy Perryman, or some one for her, executed and tendered such bond, as required by law, to the sheriff before he executed his writ, or took the property into possession under it. The demurrer was sustained by the Circuit Court, and the plaintiff having declined to amend, final judgment was rendered in favor of the defendants, from which the plaintiff appealed. There can be no doubt but that the sheriff was not only not bound to take the property into possession, without first having the security required by the statute, but it was clearly his duty to desist from any attempt to execute the writ until such bond was tendered to him. The command in his writ is conditional: that “if the plaintiff shall give you security,” &c., “you cause the goods and chattels to be replevied and delivered to the plaintiff,” &c. The 10th sec. Dig. ch. , provides that such writ shall not be executed in any case, unless the plaintiff, or some other person in his behalf, shall execute bond, &c. And the 12th sec. provides “that upon the receipt of such writ and bond before required, the sheriff shall forthwith proceed to execute such writ,” &c. No one can read these sections without being satisfied that the sheriff exceeded his power and authority in taking the slaves into his possession, without having received the bond intended for the protection and security of the defendant, and that having done soj he was under no obligation to retain the property so taken; indeed, it was his duty at once to restore it to the defendant. The statute does not require of the sheriff to prepare a bond, nor to demand one, but before he is authorized or required to execute the writ, it is the duty of the plaintiff to make, by herself, or some one for her, a good and sufficient bond, conditioned as required by the statute with sufficient surety, and to tender it to the officer. Then should he refuse or neglect to perform his duty he may be held to account by the party injured; and should he, as in this instance, improvidently take the property into his possession without first having received such bond, (to place the case in the most favorable attitude for the plaintiff,) it was the plaintiff’s duty to prepare and tender such bond before the sheriff could be held accountable for not delivering the property to her. The language used in the breach does not necessarily imply that a bond was tendered. A “refusal to take a bond,” or in the second count, “that the sheriff did not and would not take a bond,” are not equivalent to a tender and offer of a bond, prepared as required by law. The grounds of the refusal or failure to take bond are not stated. The plaintiff may have offered to prepare a bond, and the sheriff have declined to hold up the property until it was done, or for other cause, and under the rule'that the pleader must be supposed to have presented the facts in the most favorable aspect for his client, we must presume that had a bond been tendered and offered to the sheriff it would have been so stated. We think the grounds for the demurrer well taken. Judgment affirmed.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862695,Viser vs. Bertrand,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins. This was an action of assumpsit with a count for professional services, the common money counts, and an account stated, brought by Bertrand against Mrs. Yiser, the plaintiff in error. The bill of exceptions disclosed a claim for $, charged as an attorney’s fee, and $ money advanced for her, and at her request. The evidence on the trial conduced to show the following state of facts. Bertrand had been the attorney of Mrs. Yiser in prosecuting a suit in the Pulaski Circuit Court, against her husband for divorce, and for his services in conducting that suit, the fee of $ was charged. It appears that Mrs. Yiser had several negroes, which she claimed as her separate estate, but in which Yiser also claimed- an interest by virtue of his marital rights Mrs. Yiser, the complainant, was living in LittleRock, and Yiser, the husband, was in New Orleans. A negotiation ensued between the parties to that suit, through the medium of their respective attorneys, the result of which was, in the language of Yiser’s attorney, the only material witness to this point, that “Mrs. Yiser’s attorney agreed that she would pay me $ for Yiser, if he would relinquish his claim to the negroes and make no further opposition to the divorce, which as Yiser’s attorney, I accepted.” The attorney of Viser wrote to him at New Orleans, and obtained his deed of relinquishment of the negroes. The deed was executed to Bertrand, and delivered to him, with the understanding that, after the divorce, he was to convey to Mrs. Yiser. Bertrand on behalf of Mrs. Yiser, gave his obligation for the payment of the $. Subsequently, in July, , Mrs. Yiser obtained a decree in the divorce suit, Yiser making no opposition. The payment of the $, was delayed for some time after the decree, the excuse being that Mrs. Viser had not succeeded in raising the money by the sale of one of the negroes, as was intended, and which she made some efforts to do. According to my understanding of the record there was evidence conducing to show that Mrs. Yiser, after the divorce, requested Bertrand to advance the money for her, until she could raise it by a sale or mortgage of one of the negroes, or from which the jury might have inferred the fact of such request, which however, I do not regard as material. Finally, Bertrand, who, not long after the divorce, had paid $ aboutthe first of February, , closed the matter by giving his note for the remaining $ to Yiser’s attorney, who accepted it with the understanding that he would pay it whenever called on; the witness, however, up to the time of the trial, had not called on Bertrand for the money. There was abundant evidence showing that after the divorce Mrs. Yiser, the defendant below, acknowledged her indebtedness to the plaintiff for his fee, which was agreed to be settled at $ and also for the $ advanced or assumed to be paid by him for her to Yiser, and that she, on several occasions promised to pay him those sums. On the trial in the court below, various instructions were asked for, the repetition of which in detail as given, modified or refused, would be as little calculated to elucidate the decision here as they were the issues before the jury. The points made on behalf of the defendant below were, as gathered from the instructions asked, that as the retainer of the plaintiff and the contract or agreement about the payment of the $, had their inception whilst the defendant was a feme covert, such contract was absolutely void and not binding on her; and being so, no subsequent promise by her, after she became discovert, without some new or further consideration was shown to uphold it, would amount to a ratification, or make such new promise binding upon her in law Secondly, that the plaintiff could not recover for money paid, as to so much of the claim for which he had given his note, and which did not appear to have been paid. The court below seeming to regard these propositions as law, instructed the jury on behalf of the plaintiff, that if they believed from the evidence that the defendant made a new contract, after the divorce was granted to her, upon a sufficient consideration, to pay the $ and the fee, they might nevertheless find for the plaintiff under the count upon an account stated, but upon the return of the jury reporting a disagreement the court appears to have charged that, although the original contract was void in law, yet if she made a new promise to pay since she was divorced, the consideration received by her during coverture, is sufficient to sustain such new promise, which became binding so as to authorize a recovery against her in that action. It is certainly a rule of the common law that the contract of a married woman is void. Her legal existence becomes merged in that of the husband, who, as he assumes her debts, acquires as it were, a dominion of her estate as well as her person. She could make no contract, the enforcement of which might deprive the husband of her society, or which could be obligatory upon her, because of the legal presumption that it was made under duress. The wife may impose a liability upon the husbandby acting as his agent, by his express or implied authority, but then the contract is his. The husband being liable for her support and maintainance. the law will oblige him to furnish it, and in case of his refusal, where necessaries are furnished to her, the law imposes the obligation and implies a promise on his part to pay for them. It would seem that her contracts are void by reason of incapacity to contract, and not voidable like those of an infant, to whom the law affords a protection, of which he may avail himself or waive at his pleasure. But it has long been the established doctrine of courts of equity, that in regard to her separate estate, the wife may have rights independent of, and adverse to those of her husband, which will be protected, and her liabilities in respect of such estate, enforced in that forum. When we consider the increasing tendency of legislation in this, as in other States, to emancipate the wife from the dominion of the husband, by securing to married women their separate property, and authority to acquire and hold it in their own names, discharged from liabilities incurred by the husband, it behooves us to enquire whether it be the policy or design of such legislation to exempt the separate property of the wife from liability, though it might have to be'enforced in a court of equity» upon her contracts in respect of such property. Wherever there is free agency and sufficient mental capacity, the right to contract, and the power of alienation ought to be inseparable from the ownership of property. It may indeed be limited within the period beyond which, the restraint would become obnoxious as a perpetuity, so that where a separate estate is settled upon a woman in contemplation of marriage, the terms of the settlement and the powers conferred by it might have to be pursued in order to enable the woman to charge her estate; yet it cannot be said to be the policy of the law in this country, that property should be tied up from alienation, or absolved from the just debts of the real owner; and the statute enabling married women to acquire and hold property directly, instead of through the intervention of a trustee, is one of the many evidences of the disposition to do away with the distinction between law and equity, or rather to require courts oí law, in all cases where they are capable of affording adequate relief, to administer law in the spirit of equity. Supposing in this case the money to have been fairly advanced or assumed to be paid, for the purpose of securing to the woman her separate property, or to quiet by way of compromise any doubtful claim of the husband to the usufruct', I apprehend it is not questioned; but that the claim of the plaintiff below was such as could have been enforced in a court of equity, and during her coverture as against the property. The parties were living apart, and the treaty was concerning her separate property. So far from the husband being liable, he was the adverse party in interest, and the wife by her agent or trustee, was contracting with him. The attorney thus acting as her agent, would have a lien in equity upon the property for the moneys advanced at her request, to secure her in the ownership or enjoyment of it. Even the court granting the divorce, if satisfied of the fairness of the transaction, might have made a summary order, requiring the money so advanced to be refunded, and charging the payment of it upon the property decreed to the wife. Because to the .extent that a feme covert is capable of contracting, in a court of equity, she stands on the same footing with other persons, and is regarded as a feme sole, under no disability whatever. In the case of infants, who do labor under a disability, where they avail themselves of the privilege, any court having the power, would compel them to surrender an advantage or make restitution of property, which would cease to be theirs, and be unjustly retained upon the repudiation of the contract by which it was acquired. So, a reasonable compensation for his services, to the attorney of a married woman, is chargeable upon her separate estate. If the suit is for divorce, the complaint on the part of the wife, seldom made out of levity, but more often resorted to as a desperate remedy for intolerable wrongs, though not to be encouraged, is so far favored, that the court to which she appeals will endeavor to place her upon something like an equality with the contesting husband. If she have no separate estate the allowance to her for maintainance pending the suit, or for alimony by the decree, are funds out of which she might be required to compensate her attorney. To deny to her the power of binding her estate for the retainer of competent professsional aid, so far from being an advantage, would be to disarm her in a contest already unequal^ and require her to come into court defenceless save as an object of sympathy. I am clearly of opinion, that if the jury believed the facts which I suppose the evidence conduced to prove, (leaving out of view another feature in the cause to be presently noticed,) the plaintiff below was entitled to recover upon the express promise of the defendant after she became discovert, without any new or further consideration for the promise being made to appear: and I rest my opinion distinctly upon the ground that the promise was binding, not by force of any mere moral obligation resting upon her, but because the contract or agreement made during coverture, whereby she received an advantage, and the plaintiff below suffered a disadvantage, was of such a nature as to be valid and binding upon her estate as a feme covert and a sufficient consideration to uphold her promise as a feme sole. I do not understand the case of Lee vs. Muggridge, Taun. , and the cases which followed it, to have been doubted or overruled, except to the extent of the loose expressions contained in that case, to the effect that any moral obligation is a sufficient consideration to uphold an express promise. The law is now well settled the other way, and without tracing the course of the decisions, a correct exposition of it is contained in the more recent cases of Eastwood vs. Kenyon, Ad. & Ellis , in England, and Greer vs. Archer, Barbour Sup. Ct. Rep. , among many decided in this country. Strictly speaking, á moral, distinguished from a legal obligation, and where there never was anything more than a moral obligation, is never a sufficient consideration to uphold an express promise. Many instances may be imagined where a person of refined feelings and cultivated mind would hold himself, or consider another bound by strong obligations of gratitude, where voluntary compensation might well be made, but where no promise for future compensation could raise the duty to the slandard of a legal obligation. Such duties belong to that class of imperfect obligations, binding in conscience, but whiclffihejlaw'fioes nofrecognize and will not enforce, because it cannot appreciate the consideration, or estimate the damages for a breach of duty. Indeed, no greater change in the fabric of the common law could well be conceived, than for the courts to put moral obligations upon a footing of equality with valuable considerations to uphold contracts. Besides the vague and indefinite nature of such obligations, the liability to unjust preferences of them over creditors whom the law has recognized as more meritorious, will suffice without any further conjecture, to illustrate the startling consequences that would result from such a change. The rule deduced from a review of the cases contained in the note, so often cited and approved, to Wennall vs. Abney, Bos. & Pul. , excludes the idea of a mere moral obligation as a sufficient consideration to support a promise, by confining its operation to those cases where there was a precedent good consideration to support an express promise, or from which the law would imply a promise, which might have been, or could yet be enforced, but for the operation of some'positiverule of law, as for instance, a debt once valid and subsisting, but discharged in bankruptcy, or barred by limitation, or the contract, of an infant which he may confirm at majority. It may somtimes be difficult to distinguish, between what are legal and what are moral obligations, but when ascertained, the distinction has no peculiar application to the contracts of married women, or their moral obligation for benefits conferred. It is applicable alike to all persons who have full capacity to contract. If the agreement of a feme covert to contract is valid, so as to be obligatory in equity, her promise after she becomes dis-covert need not depend upon the moral obligation; nor is the promise of one, not under a disability, aided by any moral obligation where there never was a precedent good consideration. . It is true the original contract of the defendant below, while a feme covert, could not have been enforced against her in an action at law; but if I am right in concluding that it was one for her benefit, which equity would sanction and enforce in her favor and against her estate, it would seem to be a technical and unfounded distinction to hold that there was no consideration to uphold her subsequent promise, because the original contract could not have been enforced at law. I take it to be the spirit of the rule given in the note to the case in Bos. Sf Pul., that wherever the promisee had a right, upon a good consideration, of which he might have availed himself, at law or in equity, against the promisor, and whether in the prosecution or defence of a suit, such right, though it has become unavailing, is a sufficient consideration to uphold a promise to continue or renew the former liability. The case of Littlefield vs. Shee, Barn. & Adol. , where the plaintiff, a butcher, had supplied the defendant, when a married woman, with meat for her own use, while her husband was abroad, and after his death she promised payment, does ilot militate against the position that the defendant may be liable upon her promise in this case, because there, supposing the declaration to have been free from any objection, the court must have held that if anybody was liable to the plaintiff it was the husband, it being in law his debt and not that of the wife, for whose subsequent promise there could have been no consideration beyond the supposed moral' obligation. So, in the case of Watkins vs. Halstead, Saund. Sup. Ct. Rep. , where goods were furnished to a married woman living apart from her husband, and having a separate property held for her by a trustee, and after being divorced from her husband, she promised to pay for the goods, the court say, “It is not pretended that independently of the express promise of the appellant, after she obtained her decree of divorce, this action could be sustained. If when the debt was contracted, when the goods were delivered any person was liable it was the husband. We see nothing in the case to exempt him from liability. The appellant was then a feme covert and clearly not liable. Her promise to pay was made after she was divorced, and if that promise is not supported by adequate consideration, the action must fail.” Assuming therefore, at the outset, that the original promise was not binding on the wife, and never could have been enforced against her, the court go into an examination of the cases and unavoidably conclude that the moral obligation resting upon her was not sufficient to support her subsequent promise. The other point of law raised by the instructions, is settled by the decision of this court in Neale vs. Newland, Ark. . See also Logan vs. Williamson, Ark. . R. E. Bank vs. Rawdon et al., Ark. , and Jordan vs. Adams. Eng. , that a negotiable note given and accepted in payment of a debt of a third person, becomes an extinguishment of it, and proof of this is sufficient evidence to support an action against the debtor for money paid. And upon so much of the case, as it come up on a motion for new trial, I would see no cause to disturb the verdict. But the defendant below, in her motion for new trial, besides renewing the legal exceptions I have been considering, and also urging certain matters of surprise and additional evidence, which are laid wholly out of view as insufficient, moved for anew trial upon the ground, then for the first time presented to the court, that the original consideration for her liability to the plaintiff was illegal and immoral, in this, that the money was advanced to induce Viser, the husband, to withdraw his opposition to her suit for divorce, which if it be true, would be a clear case of collusion, in violation of the spirit of the statute concerning divorces, and contrary to public policy. And after some hesitation, because the defendant, moving for a new trial, seems to stand in the attitude of one, who should come into equity with clean hands, I thinlc the court below should have granted a new trial upon this ground — not for any merit in the defendant, much less a demerit in the plaintiff who may have been acting for what he conceived to be the best interest of his client; not that I can assume the fact to be as claimed, because this as a question of fact was*-' not put to the jury or passed on by them; but because there was evidence conducing to show that the money was paid to induce Viser to make no further opposition to the divorce, as well as to relinquish his claim to the negroes. And there being such evidence, it was not only the right but th.e duty of the court to have interposed of its own motion, and put it to the jury to say whether this taint entered into and formed any part of the consideration, for which the three hundred dollars were paid, and to have charged them that if they so found, the plaintiff as to so much of his demand, could not recover. Because, otherwise, if both parties to an immoral contract, were content not to raise such objection, the courts might be compelled to adjudicate their alleged rights under contracts of that description, which the law would neither enforce nor rescind. It requires no enlarged inquiry into the policy of the statute concerning divorces, to lead to the conclusion, that if money is advanced or agreed to be paid in consideration that a party to a suit for a divorce will withdraw opposition, it amounts to collusion. The statute requires, in suits for divorce, at least a decent show of opposition, and where that is wanting, the courts should look to it with increased vigilance, that the complainant’s allegations are fully sustained by evidence. If the money was advanced for the purpose in whole or in part of compounding the suit, it could not be recovered back from the party to whom it was paid, and the illegal taint would enter into and vitiate any new promise to refund made by the party, on whose behalf it was advanced. For this ground alone, and not upon any other contained in the motion, I think a new trial should have been granted. Mr. Justice Scott. None of the reasons for the motion for a new trial are tenable, as I think, except that which sets up, that in the ground of liability presented by the plaintiff below there was such gross illegality as to be justly offensive to good morals and sound public policy, in this, that a part of that, for which he proceeded, was for money advanced to induce Yiser, the husband, not only to relinquish his claim to the negroes in dispute, but to withhold his opposition to the suit of the wife for a divorce. The former might well be upheld, because of the law’s high favor of compromises] but its abhorrence of collusion in a suit for divorce, is so great, that relief should be at once given on such ground, even at the application of a particeps .criminis. It does not give relief, however, in such case to the party, but to the public through the party, for the promotion of decency and public morals. And it will be afforded as well where there may be just demands united with one so tainted, as where the latter may be the sole foundation of the suit; because it is the public interest alone that the law thus seeks to subserve; and it was the party’s own folly to mix a rotten demand with a sound one. Nor should this ground of interposition by the court be any the less regarded, because it was not mooted during the trial in chief. So far from this, it is the bounden duty of the courts to guard the public morals of the country to the full extent of their powers, and for this purpose to interpose of their own motion for their vindication on all proper occasions. Nor does any matter touching public decency and sound morals, and the very pith of the Jeaven of social life, so much deserve the vigilance of the courts as this very matter of divorce. The marital tie, although a civil .contract in the eye of the law, differs from all other civil contracts in one essential particular. The parties can never annul it by means either direct or indirect. TIence the indexible rule of law, that the confessions of either party are wholly incompetent as evidence. Nor does our statute, which directs that “like pi'ocess and proceedings shall be had in” divorce cases (Dig. ch. p. , sec. ,) “as are had in other cases on the equity side of the court,” or in any other of its directions, or provisions, in any way alter or modify this vital rule of evidence touching the dissolution of the marital tie. Parties by their mutual consent, if of proper age and capacity to receive the sanction of the law, may make the marriage tie, but they can never break it according to the rul es of law and the sound morals upon which itrests, by any express, confessions, much less by those implied by a default of answer to a bill for divorce. A contrary rule, it would seem, could only be certified to the courts by express legislation, pnd even then, so great would be the inevitable abuses in its administration, that it might not be totally unworthy of consideration whether it could have operation among men in harmony with the paramount laws of God. But for this ground of the motion for a new trial, it might well enough have been refused, as it was, because leaving out of view this matter of illegality, in which the public was thus concerned, and which the evidence seems to show to exist in fact, the verdict and judgment were well enough sustained. The compromise settled the property as the separate property of the wife, and certainly quoad this, she was a feme sole in a court of equity, and liable not only for her contracts concerning it, but also for others that touched her personal benefit, if not contrary to law; and it was not unlawful for her to sue for a divorce and employ counsel to sustain her suit. I concur with my brother judges in awarding a new trial. Mr. Justice Walker. This was an action of assumpsit brought by Bertrand against-Mrs. Viser. The defendant pleaded the general issue, and the-case was tried by a jury, who found a yerdict for the plaintiffiThe defendant filed her motion for a new trial, setting out various causes for the same, amongst which it may only be necessary to enumerate those which affirm that the court erred in the-' instructions given, and in refusing to give instructions asked by the defendant and that the verdict was contrary to the evidence, to law, and to the instructions of the court. The motion for a' new trial was overruled and the defendant excepted, setting out the evidence, and has brought the case here by writ of error. The plaintiff’s action is founded upon two items of charge, the nature of which we will proceed to consider. The first is for professional services rendered by the plaintiff in obtaining a divorce for her. These services were contracted for and rendered whilst the defendant was a feme covert, and therefore the contract as to her was void. The plaintiff admits this, but relies upon an express promise to pay after the divorce, upon the ground that, although no legal obligation rested upon her to pay, that her moral obligation was a sufficient consideration for such, express promise. If this contract had been voidable instead of void (as if made with an infant) the question would have been more free from doubt. The point of difficulty is whether, if no legal obligation, ever existed, a moral obligation can be said to exist, such as will be a sufficient consideration to uphold an express promise to pay. Upon examination of the authorities I think it may be said that there must be such legal obligation or a legal and sufficient consideration, such as might have been enforced through the medium of an implied promise, had it not been suspended by the incapacity of the feme covert to contract. Kent, in his Commentaries, part , vol. , p. , says, “A sufficient legal obligation to do a thing is a sufficient consideration for a promise to do it; but it has been an unsettled point, whether a mere moral obligation be of itself a sufficient consideration for a promise, except in those cases in which a prior legal obligation or consideration had once existed. The weight of authority is that it is not sufficient.” And it is laid down by Chitty in his work on Contracts, page , “That an express promise can only revive a precedent good consideration which might have been enforced at law through the medium of an implied promise, had it not been suspended by some positive rule of law, but can give no original cause of action, if the obligation on which it is founded never could have been enforced at law, though not barred by any legal maxim or statute provision.” The same rule is laid down in Bosanquet & Puller . Smith vs. Vare, John. R. . In the case now under consideration, although no legal obligation existed under which the defendant could have been compelled to pay for the professional services, still such services were a legal consideration which but for the rule of law that makes void the contract of a feme covert, a recovery might have been had upon an implied assumpsit, and consequently furnished a sufficient consideration to uphold an express promise made after the divorce to pay for them. Nor was it necessary in order to make the express promise binding upon the defendant, to prove affirmatively that she knew at the time the express promise was made, that she was not bound in law by her former contract. This, in the absence of evidence to the contrary must be presumed. As regards the other item of charge, the $, the facts are these. The complainant sued her husband for a divorce, and also set up claim to several slaves, as her separate property. Defendant employed counsel and was preparing to defend, contesting the complainant’s title to the slaves; but upon a conference between the complainant and the defendant, through their respective counsel, it was proposed that complainant would pay defendant $, if he would relinquish his claim to the negroes, and make no further opposition to the divorce, which terms were agreed to, and at the request of complainant, the plaintiff in this suit and his associate counsel entered into an obligation to the attorney for the husband, binding themselves to pay him the sum of $. This contract was entered into whilst the defendant in the present action was a feme covert. The relinquishment was procured from the husband by his attorney and delivered to the plaintiff, Bertrand, who still (so far as appears from the evidence) retains the same. No defence was made to the suit for a divorce, and after it was obtained, the defendant repeatedly promised to pay the sum so secured by plaintiff and his associate counsel, Lincoln. But there is no proof that defendant requested plaintiff to pay said sum after she was divorced. The payment of the $, and the note for $ seems to have been an arrangement between the plaintiff and the attorney for the husband without special directions or request from defendant, indeed she at one time, expressed to Webb, a witness, fears that her attorneys had not acted fairly with her, and had in fact not paid the sum aforesaid. The testimony of the other witnesses, it is true, acquits the plaintiff of all unfairness, but so far as the latter arrangement of payment is concerned, this goes to show that .representions had been made to her about the payment of the money, with regard to the truth of which she was not satisfied. In view of the whole of the evidence, there can be no doubt of a full recognition of the contract made whilst defendant was a feme covert, and of her promise to pay it after the divorce; but there is no evidence of any new contract made after that time, nor does it appear from a careful review of the whole of the evidence, that Bertrand, the plaintiff, took in the obligation of himself and Lincoln, and paid the f , and gave his note for the balance at the instance of the defendant or with her consent. Waiving then the consideration of the question, as to whether .the promise to pay the $, could be given in evidence under the counts in the declaration, the main question is, that conceding the money to have been paid either before or since the divorce was obtained, was this a precedent good consideration which might have been enforced at law, through the medium of an implied promise, had it not been suspended by that rule of law which denies the validity of the wife’s contracts made during coverture. The item of charge for professional services was alone encumbered with this positive rule of law. The subject matter of the contract was not against the law, or the policy of the law. But with regard to this latter item, the $, a part at least of the consideration and inducement to the contract was, that the husband should offer no defence to the suit fora divorce. This was clearly against the policy of the statute in regard to divorces, under the provisions of which, the particular grounds of complaint must be set forth in the bill and sworn to. And the complainant is also required to swear that the complaint is not made through levity, or by collusion, fear or restraint, between complainant and defendant, for the mere purpose of being separated from each other, but in sincerity and in truth, for the causes in the bill set forth. The contract of marriage, unlike ordinary contracts of business, is one which the public, as well as the individuals contracting, is interested in preserving unbroken, unless for such causes as are specially set forth in the statute, and these causes must in fact exist, and must be shown to exist by evidence. No admissions of the defendant, whether by answer or by failure to answer, will supersede the necessity of proof of the truth of the allegations in the bill. And every contract not to defend or withhold evidence which, if produced, would tend to disprove the allegations in the bill, is clearly in violation of the spirit of the statute, and should not be enforced. This question was distinctly presented in the case of Sayles vs. Sayles, Foster’s N. H. Rep. , in which the validity of a contract not to defend against a suit for divorce came up: and there no question arose as to the capacity of the parties to contract, because the husband executed the note, and the suit for divorce was by him, not the wife, as in this case, so that the whole question turned upon the validity of the contract, in reference to the subject matter about which it was made. There the husband filed his bill for a divorce; pending the suit, conversations were held between the counsel of the respective parties which resulted in an agreement by which the complainant executed a note for $, payable to the son of the wife, and delivered to a third person, with the understanding that if the complainant succeeded in obtaining a divorce, and if opposition to obtaining the divorce was withdrawn by the wife, then upon the application to the holder of the note, it was to be delivered up to the wife or her agent. It appears that no defence was made, and that the divorce was obtained and the note delivered up, and suit brought upon it. It was in proof that the consideration and inducement for making the note, was the withdrawal of opposition to the divorce and some contribution towards the support of the wife by the son to whom the note was executed. The defence set up by the husband against the payment of this note was, that the note was illegal and void, as being against public policy. Upon this state of facts, the court said, “The evidence in this case pretty fully establishes a case of collusion between the parties, to obtain a divorce at the hands of the court, when both parties knew or had good reason to believe that no sufficient legal excuse for it existed. No such agreement, even if executed, can form a valid consideration for either a verbal or written promise. The great and principal object of the agreement made between the parties was, to bring about a dissolution of the marriage contract, and to put an end to the various duties and relations resulting from it. A contract having any such purpose, object and tendency, cannot be sustained in law, but must be regarded as against sound public policy, and consequently illegal and void.” In this case there was no want of capacity to contract, and the contract was reduced to writing and delivered up after the divorce was obtained, and yet it was held upon grounds of public policy to be void. This rule is firmly established. The object of the law is to suppress vice, and to promote the general welfare of society, and no individual shall be assisted by the law in enforcing a demand originating in a breaeh or violation on his part of its principles. Chitty on Con. . Craig vs. State of Missouri, Peters Rep. . Humph. Tenn. Rep. . Maule & Selw. . And in the enforcement of this rule neither party has any just cause of complaint. It is true that the objection comes with a bad grace from the defendant, who has reaped the benefit of this agreement by obtaining the divorce; but it is not for her sake that the objection is allowed. It is founded upon principles of public policy, which forbids that courts should lend their aid to one who founds his cause of action upon an illegal act. Such being my view of th'e law governing the contract upon which the action in this case is founded, I will proceed to consider such of the instructions of the Circuit Court as bear upon this point, the determination of which should, I apprehend, suffice to settle the whole case. The court, in my opinion, correctly instructed the jury that the contract of a feme covert was void, and as related to the $, also correctly instructed, that asubsequent express promise made after she became a feme sole, to pay such contract, would not bind her; but then, I think, the court improperly instructed the jury, that if defendant made a new contract upon sufficient consideration to pay the $ and the fee, they might find for the plaintiff; because in the absence of any instructions as to what was a sufficient consideration, the jury might have supposed the consideration upon which the contract was originally made was sufficient to uphold the new promise, and it was objectionable also, because there was no evidence whatever of any new contract, and therefore the instructions tended to mislead the jury. The court also erred, in my opinion, in giving the instruction asked for by the plaintiff, the substance of which was, that a promise to pay after the divorce, and before suit brought, would, if proven, entitle the plaintiff to recover under the account stated; because, in order to entitle the plaintiff to recover the $, it was not only necessary to prove an express promise within the time as set forth in the instructions, but also that said promise was upon a present or prior legal consideration, and so far from such being the case, to have made the instructions full, and such as would truly have applied to the state of the evidence, the court should have instructed the jury that a contract made in considetion (in whole or in part,) that the defendant, in a suit in chancery for a divorce, would make no defence to the suit, was against public policy and void, and that if such appeared to them to be the case in this suit, they should find for the defendant, so far as-the plaintiff’s right of action was founded upon such contract. The last instruction given appears tome still more objectionable than either of these. It was that a valuable consideration received upon the original contract, even though the contract might be void, was sufficient to uphold a new promise to pay, made after the divorce. If void alone because of the incapacity of the defendant to contract, then the instruction might have been sustained, but when void also, because the consideration was illegal, as in this case, it was the very reverse of the law as applicable to the state of facts before the jury, I conceive it unnecessary to consider the other exceptions, as from the view which I have taken of the case, the plaintiff might well have recovered under the count for professional services, but could not, under any form of pleading, recover the sum of $, assumed-by him to the attorney for the defendant. I am of opinion that the judgment ought to be reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions to grant the defendant a new trial.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862728,Floyd et al. vs. Ricks,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Hempsteaj?, Special Judge, delivered the opinion of the Court. The most material inquiry in this case is, whether a person who settles on public land and plants a crop can maintain trespass guare clausum fregib against one, who subsequently purchasing the land from the United States, enters for the purpose of gathering and converting such crop to his own use. And although the question is not free from difficulty, yet on principle and authority, we think it must be answered in the negative. In Boyer vs. Williams, Miss. , it was held that a purchaser from the United States was entitled to all crops growing upon the land at the time of purchase. And in Rasor vs. Qualls, Blackf. , it was decided that where a person having a preemption right to a tract of land, permitted the time to expire without making the purchase, a stranger who afterwards purphased the land from the United States, was entitled to the growing crop. And on a like principle it has been decided by the Supreme Court of Illinois in Carson vs. Clark, Scam. , and the Supreme Court of Mississippi, in Merrell vs. Legrand, How. , and by this court in McFarland vs. Mathis, Eng. , that a promise, made by a purchaser of public land after entry, to pay an occupant for improvements made prior fo the entry, is withpqt consideration and void. Every valid contract must be founded on a sufficient consideration and these cases rest on the ground that the occupant has no right of property in the crop or the improvements as against the alienee of the government, and therefore cannot recover in any action. The case of Turley vs. Tucker, Miss. , is an express au.thority to the point that an occupant of the public land has not such an interest in timber cut by him as to enable him to maintain an action of trover against one who takes the timber away and converts it to his own use. If there is no reservation or stipulation to the contrary, a conveyance of land carries with it the growing crops, or as expressed by Spencer J., in Forte vs. Calvin, Johns. , “the ownership of the land draws after it that of the crops, and it cannot admit of a doubt that a sale of the land simply, by the owner both of the land and crop, carries the property of the crop to the purchaser.” Leigh. . Watts. . And in Gibbons vs. Dillingham, Eng. , this court held the same doctrine, saying that “ the authorities are full a,nd clear upon the point that where a party executes an absolute deed in fee of the soil and without an express reservation of the growing- crop, his interest in snch crop also passes by such conveyance.” A sale by the United States falls within this general rule. The ^ land, with the improvements and crop pass to the purchaser, (Carson vs. Clark, Scam. . Boyer vs. Williams, Miss. ), and we think it can make no difference whether the crop is severed or not. in either event it belongs to the owner of the soil, and such is the doctrine of adjudged cases, which we think is maintainable on the principles of reason. Congress is invested by the constitution with the power of disposing of and making needful rules and regulations, respecting the public domain. In the exercise of this power land offices have been established, officers appointed, the mode and manner of sales of the public domain regulated, and the manner by which the United States may be divested of the legal title prescribed. Now every man is presumed to be acquainted with the law, and hence the settle? on public land is bound to know that when the land, upon which he may reside, comes into market agreeably to the laws and regulations of the United States, a stranger has the right to purchase it and thus become the owner in fee simple, unencumbered by any claim on the part of the settler. And he is further bound to know that the absolute ownership of the soil necessarily draws along with it the right to the crop, and emblements produced from it, whether severed or not, and all improvements on the land. The settler having nothing beyond a mere naked possession, with no interest in the soil, if he plants what he cannot enjoy, or puts improvements on the land and loses them, it is in both cases his own folly, and certainly he ought not to be heard to complain of hardship, which he voluntarily brought on himself, and against which he might have guarded by becoming the purchaser and thus merge his occupancy in a superior title. He is bound to know that the land may be purchased by a stranger at any moment, and it may not inaptly be compared to the case of a tenant who sows a crop w'hich cannot mature before the expiration of his lease, and who loses it for the reason that it is his own folly to sow when he knows that his term must expire before harvest. Kent, . But even if it were true that it is onlyr.the unsevered crop that would pass, it would not affect this case, because it appears from the certificate of the register of the Champagnoile land district offered, and which should have been received in evidence, that that the land upon which the corn crop was planted by Ricks, iVvas entered by James M. Floyd, one of the defendants, on the 10th day of August, , and this court taking judicial notice of the seasons and oí the general course of agriculture, know that -the crop could not have matured at that date so as to be served, and consequently the severance must have been after that period. ■And this too may be fairly inferred from the proof. It follows then in any event that on that day Floyd, becoming the owner of the land in fee simple, by purchase from the United States, was entitled to the crop, and Ricks had no right or authority to enter or interfere with the land or crop. The certificate of the Register of the Land Office was competent evidence. By force of statutory provisions it is sufficient title to maintain ejectment, and of course is sufficient to establish title either in the prosecution or defence of any action. Digest . This question was settled in McCLairen vs. Wicker, Eng. , in favor of-the admissibility of the certificate, and that case' is well sustained by authority. Morton vs. Reeder, Miss. . Jackson vs. Wilcox, Scam. . S. C. Peters, . Bullock vs Wilson, Port. . The statute not requiring any authentication, it is an instru-f ment of evidence which proves itself, (Cox vs. Jones, Stew. ), and the court erred in rejecting it; because the general issue was-pleaded, which put in issue not only the fact of the trespass, but' also the title or right of the plaintiff. It follows that any title, whether freehold or possessory in the defendants, might be given in evidence under “not guilty,” if such title showed that the right of possession, which is. necessary to support trespass, was not in the plaintiff but the defendant. Chitty Pl. . Also, “the defendant may,” says Judge Tucker, “under the general issue give evidence that the right of freehold is in a third person, for this proves he had not trespassed on the plaintiff.” Tucker's Com. . In trespass to real property, whatever will show that the defendant did not commit a trespass on the close in question at-all, or that such close was not the plaintiffs, may be given in evidence under not guilty. Bac. Abr., Trespass, (I.) And it is further said in that book, that the general issue will be applicable if the defendant did break and enter the close, but it was not-in possession of the plaintiff, or not lawfully in his possession, as against the better title of the defendant; for as the declaration alleges the trespass to have been committed on the close of theplaintiff, not guilty involves a denial that the defendant broke' and entered the close of the plaintiff, and is therefore a fit plea if the defendant means to contend that the plaintiff had no possession of the close sufficient to entitle him to call it his own. Bac. Abr. Trespass, (K.) . Stephens' Pl. , . It will be perceived that the certificate was admissible under this plea, because it proved that the freehold was not in the plaintiff and that he had no right to recover in the action, or by any form of pleading. The defendants offered in evidence an instrument of writing, executed by James M. Floyd, in the presence of two subscribing witnesses, purporting to convey to Andrew J. Floyd,the “undivided-half” of the tract of land mentioned in the certifícate and offered to prove its execution and delivery by one of the subscribing witnesses, on a day previous to the alleged trespasses, but the court refused to permit such proof to be made, and excluded the instrument. It is a proposition not to be disputed, that a deed delivered passes the title, as between parties, although it is neither acknowledged nor recorded. Fitzhugh vs. Croghan, J. J. Marsh, , . Turner vs. Step, Wash. . Marshall vs. Fish, Mass. . In Jackson vs. Post, Cow. , it was said by Sutherland, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, that “as between the parties to k conveyance, the recording of it was not necessary to give it legal force and efficacy. It divested the grantor of all his interest in the land, and transferred it to the grantee.” Such a deed cannot prevail against creditors and purchasers without notice. But notice of an unrecorded deed is equivalent to a record of it, and will necessarily destroy the effect of a subsequent registered deed, because one object of the registry acts is to give notice to subsequent purchasers, and if they have such notice without registry, that is all that can be required. Jackson vs. Burgott, John. . Our statute concerning conveyances, provides for the acknowledgment or proof, and recording of deeds, {Digest ), but there is nothing to indicate that an unrecorded deed shall be void,but on the contrary, a clear intention is manifested that it should be entirely effectual to pass the estate, as between the parties and their representatives. The position of the counsel of the appellants, that the only benefit to be derived from having a deed recorded is to dispense with the necessity of proof of execution, and to give precedence over subsequent purchasers and creditor’s, is deemed to be a sound interpretation of the registry acts. This instrument was without date but a deed takes effect from delivery ( Kent. ), and the offer was to prove delivery at a day anterior to the alleged trespasses. But on examination of this instrument, we find that it lacks one important requisite of a deed. It does not appear to be sealed, and although this may be a clerical misprision, still we must take it as we find it in the transcript. The vei y term “deed” implies a sealed instrument. Sealing at common law was an impression on wax, or wafer, or some other tenacious substance capable of being impressed; ( Inst. . Kent, ), but here that is not necessary, our statute declaring that every instrument of writing expi-essed on the face thereof to be sealed, and to which the person executing the same shall affix a scroll by way of seal, shall be deemed and adjudged to be sealed. Di■gest . The statute is only cumulative, and the common law mode would still be good. But this instrument being destitute of either, could not, in our opinion, operate to pass the legal estate. But the court should have allowed the proof, and if sufficient, have admitted the instrument, because there can be no doubt that it would be competent evidence under the general issue, to at least show that the grantee had lawful license and authority to enter on the freehold, derived from the owner, and could not therefore be guilty of trespass any more than the legal owner of the freehold himself. It is not conceived important to discuss the instructions given or refused, because we think it appears distinctly that the close mentioned in the declaration, was not the close of the plaintiff, that he neither had the right of possession nor property, and therefore any instructions predicated upon the idea of his right to recover would be in their nature improper. Aside from that, the first and third instructions given for him are objectionable, because they assume the alleged trespasses to have been proved, and whether they were or not, was a fact to be found by the jury, and which the court had no right to assume as established. Instructions should be hypothetical, and embody in plain and succinct language, the true principles of law, applicable to the facts as developed on trial; but not assume facts to be proved, because that is an invasion of the province of the jury. Eight instructions were asked by the defendants, two of which were given and the rest refused. These instructions were based mainly if not entirely on the rejected testimony, and should not have beep asked; but the defendants ought to have stood on their exceptions to the rejected testimony. A party has no right to instructions looking to or based on such testimony; because the instructions are just as abstract as if no testimony had been offered and rejected. If the testimony, which the court improperly excluded, had been before the jury, the fourth, fifth and seventh instructions asked would have fairly presented the law of the case, and the others would have been unnecessary, and might for that reason have been refused. To multiply instructions and put ideas in .every conceivable phase is a highly objectionable practice; because it increases the labor of the court, and has a tendency to confound the jury, by making the impression on their minds that instead of one or two, they have many and difficult issues to decide. These instructions would necessarily put an end to the case and accord with the law; for a person having a right to enter on land, is not liable in an action of trespass for entering even with force, Wilde vs. Cantillion, I John. Cas. . Hyatt vs. Wood, John. . John. . McDougal vs. Litcher, John. . No person can recover upon a claim of right to property against .another whose rights to the subject matter are superior to those .of the person so claiming damages for a violation of his supposed rights. If the entry is violent and with a multitude of people, it may be an offence for which the» party so entering must answer criminally, but it would be an absui’dity to say that he must also be responsible in damages, as for an injury to a person who has no right. Per Spercer, J., in Hyatt vs. Wood, John. . In Tribble vs. Frame, J. J. Marsh. , it is said that, at the common law a person holding the title to land and having the right of entry, might use actual force, if necessary, for overcoming any forcible resistance; because his right of entry being perfect, no other person could lawfully resist him in the exercise of his perfect right. Now the right of entry in Floyd was perfect from the 10th of August, , and Ricks could not rightfully oppose it; and the entry on the land as actually made by the Floyds, seems to have been peaceable and orderly, and intended to secure and preserve the crop; most of which, however, was taken away by Ricks, who had no right to it. The court should have granted the motion for a new trial on the ground of the improper exclusion of the evidence before alluded to. This is a fit opportunity of adverting to a practice which seems to have become prevalent in inferior courts, as it regards new trials. A motion for a new trial, in many instances, appears to be regarded as a matter of form, and as a mode of saving the points accruing at the trial, and of putting a case in a proper attitude to be reviewed by this court. The party usually expects no benefit from it in the inferior court, and as it is made without hope, it is denied without due investigation. In view of the zeal of suitors, the want of time for deliberation, especially as to complicated questions, and the usual circumstances attending a trial at nisi prius, it is no imputation against the learning and ability of the respective presiding judges in those courts, to say that errors are almost unavoidable. But upon more mature deliberation they may and ought to be corrected in the tribunal where they were committed, without forcing the unsuccessful party into this court for redress. And the means of doing justice are more extended in the inferior than in this court, because, as it is the duty of the judge there, to observe and note the testimony and points during the progress of the trial, he is presumed to do so, and is through that medium cognizable of the whole case from beginning to end; the demeanor of the witnesses, and other circumstances calculated to have an influence on the verdict. A motion for a new trial places the law and facts before him, unembarrassed by any question of power, and he is more likely to be able to correct injustice than an appellate court, because the latter acts only on questions of law, and cannot act on matters of fact, or disturb a verdict on the mere weight of evidence.

1862679,"Bankhead, ex. vs. Hubbard, et al.","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1852-07,Ark.,"Hempstead, Special Judge, delivered the opinion of the Court. The constitution of this State vests in the Probate Courts such jurisdiction in matters relative to the estates of deceased persons, executors, administrators, and guardians, as may be prescribed by law. Const, sec. , Art. . The administration law authorizes the clerks of Probate Courts to grant letters testamentary, and of administration, subject however, to the confirmation or rejection of the court {Digest ), and requires bond from the person to whom letters testamentary or of administration are granted with two or more securities, residents of the county, to the State of Arkansas, in such sum as the court or clerk shall deem sufficient, not less than double the amount of the estimated value of the estate. If the bond is taken by the clerk in vacation, it is subject to the approval or rejection of the court in term time. Digest, , . And as to securities, it is ^enjoined as a duty to take persons who are solvent and sufficient, and who are not bound in too many other bonds, and testimony may be taken to ascertain these facts. And an additional bond may be required in certain cases, and on failure to give it, the letters may be revoked. Digest . These provisions speak for themselves, and are too plain to Require construction or argument. They indicate the general policy of' the act to be to require security in all cases. This security is for the benefit of creditors, heirs, devisees and legatees, and there are but few instances in which it should be dispensed with. Perhaps, in the case of a sole heir or devisee, being appointed executor or administrator, and no debts against atf estate, bond and security need not be given, because waste or mismanagement of the estate would be guarded against by motives of self interest, and in any event could injure no one but himself, and there may be other cases within a similar reason. But the case should be clear, because a doubt in the scale ought to operate in favor of requiring security, that being a general requisition, which the Legislature had the power and thought proper to make. The clerk stands in a different position from the court, and has, in our opinion, no discretion on the subject, and must therefore take bond and security in all cases. His act must pass under the review of the court, and must be confirmed or rejected. The court has discretion, but the clerk none, and his act is merely ministerial/’ We are not to be understood as deciding that letters granted without security are absolutely void; because we do not deem the bond a condition precedent to the validity of the letters. We think the statute is directory, and that the court may, in some instances, dispense with security. But in granting, rejecting, or revoking letters, or taking, or dispensing with security, or requiring new security, the Probate Court possesses under the law a large discretion; which will not and should not be controlled by this court, unless there has been such an outrageous abuse of that as to produce manifest injustice. The case must be a strong one to call for our interposition. In this case we regard the action of the Probate Court as entirely proper, and within the scope of its legal authority. But if otherwise, we would not interpose for another reason, which is, that oral testimony might be taken on these investigations; and where, as in the case here, the bill of exceptions fail to show either expressly or by necessary implication, that it contains all the testimony adduced on the investigation or trial, the presumption must be in favor of the judgment.

1862636,Abraham Ex'r. vs. Gray & wife,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1853-07,Ark.,"Hon. Isaac Strain, Special Judge, delivered the opinion of the Court. This is an action of debt brought upon a writing obligatory for one thousand dollars. To this action the defendant below filed several special pleas in bar. To all of which the plaintiff demurred, and the court below sustained the demurrer; the defendant rested, and judgment was given for the plaintiff below. The first plea sets up, “that the said writing obligatory was executed and delivered in consideration that said Thomas H. should obtain, and upon the supposition that he did then and there obtain a valid title to, and become the absolute owner of a certain negro slave named Manuel; and the said defendant avers that said Thomas H. did not, nor did any person claiming by, through or under him, obtain or acquire a valid title to, or become the absolute owner of said negro, and so said defendant says, that the consideration of and upon which said writing obligatory was given has failed; and this he is ready to verify, &c. Whether the “said Thomas H. received a valid title and become the absolute owner of said slave Manual,” is a question of law depending upon the facts of the case. These facts ought to have been set out in the plea. It should have shown how the title to said slave Emanuel was invalid, and the facts which precluded the said. Thomas H. from becoming the “absolute owner.” Pleas alleging an “invalid” or defective title, and that therefore the consideration failed, must set forth the particular facts showing how the title is invalid, and wherein it is defective. Dickson vs. Burk, Eng. . The plea is evidently defective and the demurrer was properly sustained thereto by the court below. The second plea is the same as-the first with the additional allegation: “That said Edwards on the day of the date of said writing obligatory obtained possession of said negro and held him until the day of March, , when said negro killed said Edwards, and was afterwards, to wit: on the day of May, , for that offence, pursuant to the sentence of this court, capitally punished and executed. And said defendant avers that said Edwards never did acquire a valid title to or become the absolute owner of said negro, and that said Edwards, in his lifetime, to to wit: on the 20th day of Nov. , paid to the plaintiff the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars upon said writing obligatory, which sum was much more than sufficient to satisfy and pay for the hire and services of said negro after said Edwards so obtained possession of him and for all benefit he derived from said purchase.” The matters and things contained in this allegation, instead of going to show that Edwards had no valid title, admit and show that he did have a valid title to said negro. In October, , when said writing obligatory was executed and delivered in consideration of said negro Manual, the said negro was delivered to said Edwards, the vendee, at the same time, ánd all the right and title of Gray and wife, the vendors, to said negro Manuel, then vested in said Edwards; and the plea does not pretend to allege that any other person, at that time, had any right or title to said negro. The said negro having subsequently killed the vendee, and by the State convicted of murder therefor, and sentenced to death and executed, affords no defence to this action. It does not divest the vendee of title, or render the title invalid, or affect it any Way. The vendee took the negro subject to all subsequent casualties. The plea is bad and the court below correctly sustained the demurrer thereto. The third and last plea is in substance the same as the first, with the exception that it alleges, “that the plaintiffs falsely and fraudulently represented to said Edwards, that he” (Edwards) “had acquired a valid title thereto, and become the absolute owner of said slave Manuel,” &c., without stating what the false and fraudulent representations were, and why he did not acquire a valid title and become the absolute owner. It is therefore for the same reasons fatally defective, and the demurrer was properly sustained thereto. The allegations in these pleas, “that Edwards did not obtain a valid title to, or become the' absolute owner of said slave Manual,” in the absence of all facts upon which such deductions may be predicated, is pleading a deduction of law, which is in contravention to the rules of pleading.

1862680,Rector vs. Danley,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr .Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. According to a settled doctrine often heretofore applied in this court, the decision made when this cause was here before, is the law of the case, ( Eng. R. ,) and consequently nothing determined can be now reviewed. The evidence excluded, both as to the supposed void judgment and the process of execution thereof, and that going to show that the appellee was present at the sale of the negro in question, was properly excluded in conformity with the decision heretofore made in this cause, (ib. ,) whatever doubt the court might now entertain as to either of these propositions. And even if we could go behind that decision, and were now to hold that the supposed estoppel could have been as well set up in the court below on the law as upon the chancery side thereof, the appellant could not be considered as having been injured by the exclusion of the latter evidence, because it falls short of showing such a state of facts as would amount to the supposed estoppel. Had the excluded evidence been admitted, all 'the evidence in the entire record tending to the point in question, so far from going to establish clearly, when considered together, such facts and circumstances as would have authorized the jury to presume that the purchaser was led into the purchase by reason of the presence of the real owner, aware of his rights, and by his silence or his other acts, or conduct; it conduces to show, with perhaps equal clearness, that he would not have been deterred from the purchase by any thing that the appellee could have said on the occasion. We think the instructions given were obnoxious, only to verbal criticism, if any, which could not possibly have affected injuriously the interest of the appellant. Certainly the supposed excessive generosity of the first instruction as to the possession of the son, by means of the possession of the father, is fully enough qualified by the words, “so long as they live together,” which follow, when considered in reference to evidence before the jury. And the fourth instruction, although broad enough in its terms to include all purchases and sales of personal property, whether made by private or judicial sale, although exceptional in some cases that might be conceived, could not possibly have mislead the jury in this case, where the contest is about a purchase and sale by judicial process in a cause, where the principle caveat erwptor had been already adjudicated as applicable. (ib. p. .) We think therefore, that there was no error either in the exclusion of the evidence excepted to, nor any error, even unsubstantial, that could have possibly affected injuriously the appellant’s cause either in the instructions given or in those refused. And finding the verdict and judgment sustained by the evidence the judgment must be affirmed. CASES ARGUED AND DETERMINED IN THE SUPREME COURT OF ARKANSAS, AT THE JANUARY TERM, A.

1862649,Higgins vs. Johnson et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the court. This is a bill brought by Higgins against Henry Johnson, Robert A. Johnson, Margaret Erwin, widow, and Henry C. Erwin, and others, heirs at law of James Erwin, deceased. On general demurrer the bill was adjudged insufficient for want of equity. Without going into the details of the bill with its voluminous exhibits, the substantial allegations made by the complainant are as follows: That in he purchased of James Erwin a certain tract of land, in Fayette county, Kentucky, for which he paid Erwin twelve thousand dollars : that Erwin executed his deed in fee, with covenants of seizin and general warranty for the same to the complainant, who entered into possession, made improvements, and continued in possession until , when he was evicted of one half of it by paramount title, and until about that time, he never suspected any defect in Erwin’s title, who, when he sold to the complainant, was reputed to be wealthy. That in truth the land belonged to the first wife of James Erwin, Anne B., to whom it had been conveyed by her father; so that James Erwin had only a life estate, as tenant by the courtesy. That Anne B. died leaving four heirs, Henry C., Lucretia, Eugene, and Edwin, who are living and are made defendants to the bill; that the second wife of James Erwin is Margaret, daughter of Henry and sister of Robert A. Johnson, also defendants. That in James Erwin was the owner of a large quantity oí lands situate in Phillips and other counties in Arkansas, and being then hopelessly insolvent, for the purpose of covering up these lands from the claims of his creditors, and securing the benefit of them to himself and family, he conveyed them to Henry Johnson, who, soon afterwards, conveyed them to Henry C. Erwin, who.executed a general power of attorney to James Erwin, under which the latter, during his lifetime, continued to control and dispose of them as if they were his own. That all these successive conveyances were fraudulent and colorable, made without any consideration paid or expected to be paid, with intent to hinder and defeat the claims of the creditors of James Erwin, and upon the secrét trust, that they should be held for the benefit of his family, and that Henry C. Erwin is no w liable to be charged in equity, as trustee of the legal title to the lands for the benefit of the creditors of James Erwin. That in , James Erwin, then reputed to be without property of any description, died wholly insolvent and intestate, and no administration has been had of his estate. That he left several minor children, of his second marriage, also made defendants, and that none of the children and heirs at law of James Erwin have succeeded to any property or estate by inheritance from their father. That in , after the death of James Erwin, Henry C. and Lucretia, two of his children by his first marriage, relying on the title derived from their mother, instituted suit in the Fayette Circuit Court against the complainant, and obtained judgment with an order for a writ of possession against him for an undivided two-fourths of the tract of land in question, originally conveyed to him, with warranty by James Erwin; that the supposed title, so pretended to be conveyed, has failed, and the complainant is in daily expectation of being evicted by Eugene and Edwin, the two remaining heirs of Anne B. Erwin. The bill prays for discovery, and that the alleged fraudulent conveyances from James Erwin to Henry, and from Henry to Bobert A. Johnson, and from him to Henry C. Erwin, may be set aside and cancelled, and the lands embraced in them subjected to, and sold for the payment of the debts of James Erwin, particularly that of the complainant, for the amount of which, with interest, a decree is prayed against the defendants, to be discharged out of the proceeds of the lands referred to, and for general relief. Upon the case made by the bill, the grounds of equitable jurisdiction are, that for the want of any administration upon the estate of James Erwin, there is no legal representative against whom the complainant’s right to compensation in damages for the breach of warranty could be established by an action at law; and even if there was such representative, the remedy would not be complete or adequate; because admitting tbe title of the heirs of Anne B. Erwin, to be superior to that conveyed by James Erwin, so that the complainant might have been entitled in equity, before the final payment or consummation of the purchase,' to a recision, and return of the money, yet it is questionable whether, having been only partially evicted, his remedy at law would not be confined to that position only. The effect of the covenant of warranty, as now understood in this country, is that for the breach of it, the grantee is entitled to be compensated in damages, equivalent to a return of the purchase money, with interest, put of the general estate of the grantor, made subject by law for ■the payment of his debts; and in the event of his death, to be established like other claims against his estate in charge of his administrator, and no part of which can regularly go to the heir until after all the debts of the ancestor have been paid. And though the weight of authority is, that while a judgment of recovery under a better title is equivalent to an eviction, without the issuance of execution, or an actual turning out of possession, the grantor could not maintain an action for a breach of the warranty, upon the bare fear or possibility of being sued or evicted by a superior title, so that, being evicted of part, he occupies the position oí a purchaser, who has only gotten a part of the land he bargained for, and so would be entitled to go into equity for a recision; and he may well unite in that suit his claim to compensation in damages for the part of which he has been evicted. Besides, on the Supposition that the property of James Erwin has improperly gone into the hands of his heirs, without being first subjected to a due course of administration for the payment of his debts, and such is the attitude in which Henry C. Erwin, the principal defendant, stands on this record, in the suit in equity to establish the claim and subject to its payment, the property in the hands of the heir, he cannot be regarded as a stranger, though professing to hold by purchase and not by descent; because in such case the heir is only liable to be sued, because he has the assets, which, for any cause, cannot be reached by a suit against the administrator, and it may be safely said, that as a general rule, in view of our system of administration, where the creditor is compelled to resort to the heir for payment of the debt of the ancestor, his remedy is in chancery rather than at law. It will not be questioned that where chancery once obtains jurisdiction for some substantial purpose (apart from any doubt as to mere discovery,) it will retain it for all purposes, so as to do complete justice between all the parties; and certainly it.would be difficultto suppose a case, where the exercise of such a jurisdicl tion would be more beneficial than the class of cases like the present. There is nothing in Meux vs. Anthony et al., Eng. , that ought to conflict with the opinion here. In that case, the facts were, that Royster had mortgaged certain personal property to Anthony and Perciful, to secure debts he owed them, and pending suits brought by them to foreclose, and while the property was out of Royster’s possession, it having been placed by the order of the court in the custody of a receiver to prevent its being wasted or removed by him pending the suits, and while Royster himself was in prison, under a writ of ne exeat, issued in one of those suits, he executed a bill of sale of the property in controversy to Meux, expressed to be in payment of a debt due to him, by Royster, and Meux thereupon filed his bill to arrest the foreclosure suits of Anthony, on the ground that Royster never was indebted to him, and that the mortgage was executed without consideration and with intent to defraud Royster’s creditors; The court there do not seem to have considered the alleged purchase by Meux as either fair or valid; because as the lawful purchaser, no good reason is perceived why he might not have gone into equity to impeach and set aside any prior fraudulent sale or contract respecting the same property, which was a cloud upon his title to it; but the opinion of the court, on the question here involved, is predicated upon the idea that Meux was a creditor of Royster, having a claim against him of a purely legal character, which he was seeking to enforce, and obtain satisfaction of it out of the property in dispute. Wherever the remedy is purely legal and adequate in a court of law, the rule is believed to be without exception, (See Brinkerhoff vs. Brown, Johns. Chy. .) that the creditor must not only establish his claim by obtaining judgment at law, but he must pursue it to execution, and perhaps to a return of nulla bona, before he can invoke the aid of a court of equity to assail any prior conveyance to a stranger on the ground of fraud, or enable him to reach any equitable estate or credits of the debtor intangible at law. The cumulative remedy by statute regulating creditor’s bills is to the same effect. In the subsequent case of Williams vs. Bizzell et al., Eng. , where this principle was applied, the complainant, Williams, instead of exhausting his remedy at law, failed to show that he was even a creditor by having paid the debts for which he was only liable as security. Another cause of complaint stated in the bill remains to be noticed. The complainant alleges that, in April , he purchased of James Erwin two tracts of land in Phillips county, of which he supposed Erwin to be the owner, but when he demanded a deed, to his surprise, it was made to him by Henry C. Erwin. That he had paid his acceptance in favor of Henry O. Erwin for the purchase money, the draft having come to the hands of the defendant Margaret, who presented it for payment. That those two tracts were parcel of the lands included in the fraudulent conveyances, alleged to have been made by James Erwin through Henry and Robt. A Johnson, to Henry O. Erwin. Both causes of complaint are covered by the same prayer for relief. The fact of this money having come to the hands of Margaret Erwin, might be a circumstance in evidence, tending to show the real nature of the transactions alleged to be fraudulent; but if'the complainant purchased these two tracts in good faith, for aught that appears on this bill, he acquired agood title, which is notin danger of failing. As to this part of the bill, the decision of the chancellor was right; but for the error in deciding that there is no equity in the bill, the decree must, for the reasons before stated, be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862652,Williams vs. Green,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an action of covenant, brought by Williams against Green, upon an article of agreement entered into between them on the 6th of October, , for the sale of a tract of land and improvements: the substance of the agreement, so far as necessary to be here stated, being, that Williams traded and bargained to Green a certain tract of land, containing forty-five acres more or less, the price to be thirty dollars per acre for the land, with the addition of the value of the improvements upon it, such valuation to be made by two persons named in the article, and for which payment was to be made in goods of Green, then in store, consisting of groceries, hardware; &c., at the original cost, with the addition of freight on certain of the articles, and the balance of the payment for the land to be made in good mules at cash valuation. The. agreement concludes as follows : “In wdtness of the above trade we hereby set our hands and seals, and on forfeiture of complying with it on the part of either Green or Williams, we hereby bind ourselves, our heirs, &c., in the sum of five hundred dollars, to be well and truly paid. In testimony whereof, &c. The declaration, after setting out the execution of the agreement, proceeds to aver that Waters and Grayson, the persons named therein, valued the improvements referred to, at a certain sum of money, of which the defendant had notice, and that, on the 20th day of the same month, Williams and wife made and acknowledged their deed of conveyance in fee, of the land and improvements to Green, expressed to be for the gross consideration of $,, with covenant of general warranty and relinquishment of dower, and tendered the same to Green, who refused to-accept it, or to comply in any respect with the agreement on his part. Therefore, according to what seems to be the intention of the pleader, though somewhat inartificially expressed, the plaintiff cl aims to recover the specified sum of five hundred dollars agreed to be paid by either party, on forfeiture of complying with the trade. The case went off in the court below upon demurrer sustained to the declaration. One of the causes assigned for insufficiency, and again insisted upon here is, that the declaration avers a tender of the deed by the plaintiff to the plaintiff. Supposing this allegation to be in any way material, the whole tenor and the immediate context of the declaration show it to have been a mere clerical misprision, the amendment of which, if any amendment was needed, could occasion no surprise to the defendant; and the objection is only noticed because it has been urged by counsel. But under the clause of general demurrer, and treating the action as being brought to recover the sum of five hundred dollars as stipulated damages, the question arises upon the construction of the instrument sued on, whether it was the intention of the parties to liquidate the damages consequent upon the failure of either party to comply with the agreement, or whether the clause quoted was designed as a mere penalty. If there is any branch of the law, sometimes inveighed against for uncertainty, deserving of such a reproach, it is the subject we have here to consider. And though admonished by the caution evinced by other courts of the danger of attempting to lay down any general rule for cases of this description, it seems to be necessary, in order to explain the grounds of our decision, to notice, albeit in a cursory and unsatisfactory manner, the principles which may affect the question to be decided. Anciently, at the common law, the penalty named in a bond was a security for the performance of the condition annexed to it. Upon forfeiture of the condition the obligee was entitled to recover the penalty, which was at the same time the utmost limit and beyond which the obligor’s liability could not be extended. To obviate the hardship and injustice often growing out of this stubborn rule, arose one of the early jurisdictions of courts of equity, to relieve against penalties and forfeitures, by decreeing that the judgment for the penal sum should stand as a security for the payment by the obligor of such damages as the obligee had actually sustained, of which an account would be taken. The practical effect of .the English statute, re-enacted or tacitly adopted in this country, requiring the plaintiff suing upon a penal bond to suggest the breaches complained of, and entering a formal judgment for the penalty, to have execution only for the amount of damages assessed, the penalty being in the meantime considered as a security for any further breaches that might occur, was to enable courts of law to administer the same relief before afforded in chancery. There was no substantial difference between this form of the remedy and an action of covenant upon the condition and for some breach of it, disregarding the penalty; and it became reasonably apparent, that if the courts, for the protection of the obligor, looked to the actual damages sustained by the obligee, they should equally disregard the penalty in favor of the obligee, where his damages for a breach of the condition expressing the real contract of the parties, happened to exceed the penalty. While the law was undergoing this change in England, some curious illustrations may be found in the reported cases, of a halting between the old and the new opinion. Sometimes the obligor was allowed to relieve himself from all further liability for damages, by paying into court the amount of the penalty; though an unsubstantial compliance with the contract, as unreal as it would be to compel the obligee in all cases to accept such damages as might be awarded to him, without the right in any case to have a specific performance. Wherever we admit that the enquiry now at law, as in equity, is, what damages the obligee has really sustained by a breach of the condition, it would seem to follow that, as the obligor cannot, in any case, become liable for the penalty disregarding the condition, so he can claim no protection from it. And it would seem to be equally plain, that upon bonds with a condition, an action of covenant may be maintained for damages for a breach of the condition, whenever it contains an express or implied undertaking to do or not to do the particular act. The plaintiff in such case will recover damages commensurate with the injury he has sustained. True, when the obligee brings debt for the penalty, assigning breaches for the condition, he may not, owing to the technical form of the remedy, be enabled to recover damages to an amount exceeding the penalty; and upon official bonds, and so far as the rights of securities are to be affected, recoveries against them might not be enforced to an amount exceeding the penalty which is for their protection. But while courts of equity afford relief against penalties, they will not relieve against liquidated damages. As penalties became unavailing, because the obligee, not entitled to or not seeking a specific performance, was required to accept a compensation in damages for such injury as he could show he had sustained, a new reform of contract was resorted to, whereby the parties anticipated and agreed in advance, for a certain amount of damages which would be accepted as a full compensation for such injury as might be sustained by a breach of the contract. Many cases may be supposed where it would be altogether proper and expedient to allow the damages to be thus stipulated. Prudent men understanding their own affairs, might not be willing to run the risk of a failure of evidence to prove their situation and inducements for entering into the contract, or trace the various sources from whence injury or inconvenience was expected to result. The obligor and obligee, though for opposite reasons, might be equally unwilling to submit the question of uncertain damages to any arbitration or the precarious assessment of a jury. No court has been bold enough to deny to parties capable of contracting the right to make such contracts as they choose to enter into, in any mode authorized by law, provided they be not illegal, immoral, or against public policy. But contracts for stipulated damages are narrowly watched, because of the facility they may afford of being used as a cover for penalties in disguise. One of the inflexible rules of law on this subject is, that whenever the sum agreed to be paid, though expressed as stipulated damages, is in lieu of the non-payment of a lesser sum, certain or capable of being ascertained from the terms of the contract, it is construed to be a penalty. Besides violating the usury laws, such a contract could not be enforced, as stipulated damages, because it would become a mere subterfuge and evasion of the equitable doctrine of relieving against bonds with a penalty, conditioned for the payment of money. Germain to this is the rule, equally inflexible, that the mortgagor will not be allowed by any shift or device; to cut himself off from the equity of redemption. Though the creditor, where a high standard of commercial integrity prevails, may be ruined by his debtor’s want of punctuality, the law has fixed a certain rate of interest as a compensation for the use of money. This principle distinctly stated in Orr vs. Churchil, Hen. Black., pervades all the cases. On the other hand, where the damages are in their nature uncertain and difficult of ascertainment, the amount to be paid may be stipulated by the terms of the contract; as for breach of agreement to marry a particular person. Lowe vs. Peers, Burr. . So of agreement not to cany on a rival trade or business, within certain limits, where the breach may consist in acts of frequent recurrence, and the damages are in some degree Conjectural. Crisdee vs. Bolton, Car. & Payne, , where Best, C. J. refused to subscribe to the doctrine attributed to Ld. Tentenden, in Randall vs. Everett, ib. , and advocated strongly the right of parties to stipulate for their damages. See also Green vs. Price, Mes. & Welsby , S. C. ib. . Pierce vs. Fuller, Mass. . Nobles vs. Bates, Cowen, . Smith vs. Smith, Wend. . Dakin vs. Williams, ib. . S. C. ib. . So for demurrage or delay while work shall remain unfinished, which is agreed to be done by a certain time. Fletcher vs. Dycke, T. R. , followed in this country by Curtis vs. Brewer, Pick. . And a landlord may stipulate for a particular course of husbandry, according to his supposed interest or caprice, and that if the tenant use the land differently he shall pay an increased rate of rent. Rolfe vs. Peterson, Brown's P. C. . So if he fail to reside on the estate. Ponsonby vs. Adams, ib. . At the same time, the aversion of the law to the enforcement of penalties, has induced the courts to lean in favor of the construction that the sum reserved should be held to be a penalty in cases where, upon the whole contract, there was a doubt whether the parties intended it tobe paid as stipulated damages. We have seen that the insertion of a penalty has become of little or no practical utility, and in this State where specialty debts have no preference over other debts due by simple contract, it could hardly be maintained that a penalty ailords any security whatever: so that the reason fails, for the criterion sometimes laid down, that where the sum agreed to be paid is to secure the performance of some collateral act, it will be construed as a penalty. Yet while the form of bonds with a penalty continues to be kept up in public legislation, and men in their private dealings adhere to ancient forms, the mutual observance by the parties of such formality materially influences the construction to be given to the contract. There arc many cases, where on the question of intention the construction turned, to a greater or less degree, upon the adherence to the form of a penal bond with a condition, or the use of the word penalty, or penal sum. Smith vs. Dickinson, Bos. & Pul. . Davis vs. Renton, B. & C. . Tayloe vs. Sandeford, Wheaton . Perkins vs. Lyman, Mass. . Merrill vs. Merrill, ib. . Stearnes vs. Barrett, Pick. . Brown vs. Bellows, ib. . Robeson vs. Whitesides, Serg. & Rawle . Abrams vs. Counts, Ham. . So Buller, J., said in Fletcher vs. Dyche, that where there is a penalty in a bond, it would be strange for the sum mentioned .in the condition to be called a penalty. While the case of Sloman vs. Walter, Brown Chy. Cases, asserts the undoubted jurisdiction of courts of equity, to relieve against penalties, it might be questioned if that, occurring at this day, would not be considered a proper case for liquidated damages, and would have to be upheld as a penalty upon the ground stated by Ld. Eldon, in Astley vs. Weldon, (infra,) that there, by the form of the instrument, the sum appeared to be a penalty. But the indications given by the form of the contract, or the expressions used, of an intention to stipulate the damages, or to reserve a penalty merely, are not conclusive, and may be controlled by a contrary intention manifestly appearing from the tenor of the instrument, and the object the parties must have had in view. It would seem to be clear that the acceptance of stipulated damages, which have been agreed upon as an adequate compensation for the breach of a covenant to do or not to do any particular act, is an extinguishment of all claim to additional damages, or for further breaches, and is an implied license to the defendant to do or not to do the act, because, if the obligee had any right in such case, to have a specific performance, he has waived it by electing to proceed for the damages. In some of the cases it appears to be taken for granted, that in order to constitute liquidated damages, the covenantor must have the option of complying with the contract, or paying the alternative compensation agreed upon. White vs Dingly, Mass. . Glosson vs. Beadle, John. . Hasbrook vs. Tappan, id. . Gray vs. Crosby, ib. . Pearson vs. Williams, Wend. . S. C. ib. . The covenantee has the right to insist upon entire performance, or the stipulated damages in lieu of it; but where there is a part performance, or acceptance of a benefit under the contract, the agreement for stipulated damages is broken up. As a compensation, it would have to be apportioned according to the extent of the performance. The cases to this effect depend upon the analogous principle, that the vendee in possession cannot i:esist the payment of the purchase money, or if allowed to set up a partial failure of consideration, a proportionate share of it, because he did not get all he contracted for. Sprite vs. Taylor, Metcalf . Ayres vs. Pease, Wend. . Skinner vs. White, Johnson, . Dyer vs. Dorsey, Gill & John. . Watts vs. Shepherd, [] Ala. . Gower vs. Saltmarsh, Missouri . And in Bright vs. Rowland, Howard Miss. , the decision against stipulated damages was influenced by the supposition that, in the event of partial performance of an entire contract, the defendant would remain subject to pay the entire amount stipulated, and which would then become in the nature of a penalty. The expression of Heath, J., in Astley vs. Weldon, Bos. & Pnl. , that “where articles contain covenants for the perform anee of several things, and then one large sum is stated at the end, to be paid upon breach of performance, that must be considered as a penalty,” though often quoted, furnishes a rule of very limited application to such contracts. It is demonstrated by the subsequent cases in England that it is no objection to an agreement for stipulated damages, where there are several acts to be done or abstained from, because they appear to vary in importance. Unless the right of parties so to contract is denied, the only effect of such a rule would be to require parties to be more specific in making the stipulation apply to the breach of each separate undertaking. In Kemble vs. Farren, Bingham , the agreement provided for mutual acts to be done, of different degrees of importance, some of them being the payment of small sums of money by way of salary, with a clause, “that if either of the parties should neglect or refuse to fulfill the said agreement, or any part thereof, or any stipulation therein contained, such party should pay to the other, the sum of L., to which sum it was thereby agreed that the damages sustained by such omission, neglect or refusal should amount: and which sum was thereby declared by the said parties to be liquidated and ascertained damages, and not as a penalty, or penal sum, or in the nature of one.” The draughtsman of this instrument certainly had endeavored to take the distinction adverted to by Ld. Tenterden in Davis vs. Renton, between a penalty and liquidated damages, and though it was likened to Astley vs. Weldon, C. J. Tindall, put the case upon the ground, equally applicable to Astley vs. Weldon, that by it a large sum of money might become payable in consequence of the non-payment of a smaller sum. So that, however clear the intention of the parties might be, as expressed, it was not allowable for them to contract in that way. The decision in Boys vs. Ancel, Bing. N. C. , really turned upon the same distinction, because either party might have become liable to pay the sum of L., as stipulated damages, in default of paying a trifling amount, being his part of the expense of having the papers prepared. To the same effect is Horner vs. Flintoff, Mees. & Welsby . In Atkyns vs. Kennear, Exch. , the defendant was bound by the covenant to do and abstain from various things, and of varying importance, for any infringement of which he was to pay the plaintiff ?. as liquidated damages. The breach alleged was, that the defendant, contrary to the agreement, had resided within a prescribed distance. Parke B. thought that the covenant against mere residence within the prohibited limits, would be good, and it was immaterial whether the plaintiff had sustained any damage fi-om the breach of it or not, because the non-performance imports damage; and, he with the rest of the court, wholly disregarded the circumstance that, in that case, some of the covenants seemed to be of minor importance, provided the damages resulting from any breach of them would be uncertain, and the parties had chosen to attach consequence to a breach of them, even to the extent of ,?.; because, as said by Aederson B., “We cannot say they are wrong inasmuch as the damages are uncertain.” While this case, on the whole, concedes the authority of Kemble vs. Farren, by referring it to the principle that damages cannot be stipulated for the non-payment of a lesser sum; and upon the question of intention, that where the amount stipulated for the breach of several covenants is a penalty as to any one, it is to be construed as a penalty for all, it is a distinct, and strong affirmation of the untrammelled right of parties to stipulate for damages in all cases where it is lawful to do so. There are some cases, and it would be strange if there were none in a department of the law undergoing so many'transitions, which it would be difficult to reconcile or approve as precedents, upon any settled principle. Thus, of the case of Perrit vs. Wallis, Dallas , it is to be inferred that the plaintiff claimed and prove actual damages to an amount exceeding the penalty and disregarding it. In Hoag vs. McGinnis, Wend. , and Spear vs. Smith, Denio , stipulated damages, in the event of failure to abide an award, were held to be penalties, partly because it seemed an innovation upon the usual course of such submission, which the parties were presumed to have intended to follow and partly because the sole object of the submission was to ascertain how much was due from either party to the other, and so liquidate the damages in that mode, and which might prove to be a less sum than the damages stipulated. In Baird vs. Tollion, Humph. , the defendants received of the plaintiff four five per cent. State bonds, to be returned within twelve months, orpay him $,. On a suspicion of usury, which was not pleaded, the court appear to have treated the alternative sum as a penalty, though in the absence of any proof showing that the transaction was a cover for usury, it would be questionable if it ought to have been presumed, because, whether the receipt of the four thousand dollars, in State bonds, was a loan or sale of them, on time, the transaction might be a fair one, as an exchange of securities, where the plaintiff lost the interest, and the defendant ’took upon himself the risk of appreciation of the State bonds.According to the authority of that case there were lurking penalties in Gregory vs. Bewley, Ark. , Hoys vs. Tuttle, Eng. , and Bizzell vs. Blevins, ib. , where the substance of the contract was to pay a certain amount of Arkansas Bank notes, • by a given time, and in default of doing so; to pay a like sum in. money, and they were held to be undertakings in the alternative-to deliver property or pay money. The debatable ground is, whether parties will be allowed to1 stipulate for damages, where from the nature of the act to be done or omitted, the damages are uncertain, though not in their nature wholly uncertain or even difficult of ascertainment or approximation; such as executory contracts for the sale or lease of realty, or to deliver chattels. The difficulty arises out of those cases where the courts have undertaken to judge of the contract, whether the sum stipulated be reasonable or unreasonable for the parties to have agreed to, and presume their intention to have been accordingly. Dennis vs. Cummins, John. cases , Curry vs. Larer, Barr. , Spencer vs. Tilden, Cowen , adopted in Watts vs. Shepherd, and Perkins vs. Lyman, are of that character. In Spencer vs. Tilden, although the contract was not usurious, the extraneous facts had been brought before the-court, under a plea of usury, and no doubt influenced the decision. In Perkins vs. Lyman it is intimated that in the construction of contracts, in order to determine between a penalty and liquidated damages, the court may be aided by circumstances extraneous to the writing. We apprehend there ought to be no difference between this and any other species of contract, where the writing furnishes the rule of interpretation, subject to the explanation of latent ambiguities, or the meaning of the words with reference to any local usage. If a defendant could show a clear case of stipulated damages to be a penalty, he could only do so on the principle that a party may go into equity to have a conditional sale established as a mortgage. When the execution of the contract is denied, or it is impeached for want of consideration, or for usury, for overreaching or fraud in any of its protean shapes, all the attendant circumstances and inducements-are opened for proof, and then, any apparent inequality or gross unfairness on the face of the contract, would aid the proof of extrinsic facts in order to raise the presumption of fraud. The argument for the exercise of such a discretion by the courts is, that the price agreed to be paid for the property, and which also has a market value, furnishes a ready standard according to which the purchaser can be compensated for the loss of his bargain. It would be true that, where the damages stipulated to be paid to the vendor exceeds the price agreed upon for the property, it would be void as a compensation, and could only stand as a penalty for the non-payment of a lesser sum. That was the case in Moore vs. Platt, Missouri . But the case of Glosson vs. Beadle, John. , seems to go an extreme length 'the other way. There the defendant sold the plaintiff a tract of land for $, and agreed to make him a good title to it within a year, or in lieu thereof to pay him $. There the contract had been executed on the part of the plaintiff, by the payment of the purchase money, and the decision that he was entitled to recover the $ as liquidated damages, could perhaps be upheld on the supposition that the vendor meant to stipulate a certain amount of damages, in case the title failed, to cover improvements made by the vendee during the year, instead of a return of the purchase money with interest, the ordinary measure of a breach of warranty, and in that view it was a proper subject for stipulated damages. The argument stated could only affect the stipulation for damages to be paid to the vendor who had agreed to sell the property for its admitted value. But in Reilly vs. Jones, Bing. . Tingley vs. Cutler, Conn. , and Grammon vs. Howe, Maine , upon agreements to lease or sell, the actions were brought by the party undertaking to lease or sell, and stipulated, damages recovered for failure to pay the purchase money, and without any enquiry whether the sum stipulated bore a reasonable proportion to the value of the property, although in stipulating the damages, the parties had provided a mode for the cancellation of the agreement, and the plaintiff would not only recover the damages, but keep his property. That the purchaser may recover stipulated damages for the non-compliance of the party undertaking to sell or lease, is well established. Knapp vs. Maltby, Wend. . Chamberlain vs. Bagley, N. Hamp. . Brewer vs. Edgerly, ib. . Mead vs. Wheeler, ib. . Hasbrook vs. Tappan, before cited. Jenkins vs. Yates, J. J. Marsh. . Hamilton vs. Overton, Black. . And there is no good reason why the like rule should not apply to agreements for the sale or delivery of chattels of any particular description by a day certain! If for example, the contractor to build a ship may subject himself to the payment of stipulated damages, by way of demurrage, for failing to have it completed by the time specified, he ought to have the power to stipulate in like manner with those who may undertake to furnish the materials, that are to enter into its construction. Our impression is, that wherever the act to be done or abstained from, is other than the payment of money, the circumstance that the actual damages may be more or less easily susceptible of ascertainment, ought not to influence the construction of an •agreement to be one way .or the other, a stipulation for damages or merely by way of penalty, Where the damages are at all uncertain or unliquidated, the parties ought to be allowed to anticipate and stipulate them if they choose to do so. Whenever courts attempt to take a distinction among contracts of this class, where no uniform or intelligible rule can be laid down to govern the distinction, they not only assume a most vexatious jurisdiction to reform the contracts of weak or sanguine men, but it tends to impair the confidence which all men ought to have in the obligation of contracts. The strong desire of mankind to be permitted to act as free agents rebelled against the course of decision which disarmed a penalty of its terror, and as it ceased to afford a security for the performance of a contract, they resorted to agreements for stipulated damages, which under the idea of a compensation, grew up •to be recognized as legitimate. The truth is, the real object of every stipulation for consequential damages, is to secure the performance of the contract itself, and but for the confusion of terms, it would be proper to say, that covenants to pay a certain amount of damages for the breach of any undertaking have, to the extent that they are allowable, taken the place of penalties; the only broad distinction being, and which prevails in chancery as .at law, between penalties or forfeitures for the non-payment of money, and those which are incurred by the failure to perform any other collateral act. Upon the case presented by the record here for adjudication, our conclusion, but with some hesitation, is, that according to any fair construction of the instrument sued upon, and in view of the rules of interpretation furnished by the decisions to which we have adverted, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum of five hundred dollars as stipulated damages. The word “forfeiture,” in the connection where it is used, obviously means a failure to comply with the agreement. It is true the parties have not used the term, stipulated or liquidated damages, expressive of a clear intention to negative the idea of a penalty; but on the other hand, the instrument hasnottheform of apenalbond, where the sum specified would exceed, being usually double the amount or value of the subject to which the contract related; and on the whole, we think these parties intended that the sum of five hundred dollars was to be paid by either party to the other, as an agreed compensation for such damages as would result from a refusal to comply with the trade. The price of the land was not to be paid in money, but in merchandize, some of it at the original cost, and in mules at a cash valuation. The plaintiif could not be expected to show by evidence what profits he might have made by the resale of the goods and the mules, or what other losses he may have sustained by so entire a disappointment in his contemplated arrangements. The series of acts to be done by either party, made up but one entire whole, which was the consumnjation of the trade. If at liberty to do so, we could not undertake to say that the sum here specified is unreasonable or disproportionate to the value of the property which, by the terms of the contract, was to be exchanged. The judgment will be reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions that the demurrer be overruled, and the cause further proceeded in according to law, and not inconsistent with this opinion.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862717,"Haldeman vs. Jennings & Co., use &c.","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an action of covenant brought by Jennings & Co., against Haldeman, to recover the sum of five hundred dollars, as stipulated damages for breach of a contract entered into between them. The defendant making default, the court on motion of the plaintiff, upon inspection of the instrument, and without any other testimony being adduced, proceeded to give judgment for the sum specified as liquidated damages, against the objection of the defendant, who claimed that a jury should be called to enquire and assess the actua. damages the plaintiffs had sustained by the breach, which stood admitted. By the terms of the agreement, entered into on the 28th of October, , Haldeman undertook to manufacture and deliver to Jennings & Co., in New Orleans, on or before the 1st day of July , five thousand staves, and after a minute specification of their size, quality, &c.,the agreement proceeds as follows; “And the said Jennings & Co., in consideration, &c., covenant to and with the said Peter Haldeman, that they will from time to time make such advances in goods and money to him as may appear to them proper and reasonable, as the work may progress, and for all such advances, the said Jennings & Co. shall deduct the amount or amounts thereof, out of the price tobe paid to said Haldeman, after the delivery of said staves as hereinafter mentioned. The said Jennings & Co., after the shipment and delivery at New Orleans of the before mentioned quantity of five thousand staves, shall allow to the said Haldeman, as their value, eighty dollars per thousand, first deducting the amount of said advances, and the balance over and above such advances shall be paid to said Haldeman by said Jennings & Co. “And the said Haldeman and Jennings & Co., covenant to and with each other, that each one will in good faith perform his part of the foregoing stipulations, and that a failure to perform all or any part of them, shall subject the failing party to pay the other the sum of $ as stipulated damages, without abatement or diminution.” We may suppose, that the language used by these parties, manifests a very clear intention to make it a case of ascertained and stipulated damages, and that they mutually intended it to be so. If the stipulation had been confined to the breach of the agreement on the part of Haldeman, we could have no doubt that the damages which might be sustained by Jennings & Co., in such event, would be of that uncertain character, which would make it effectual and binding on him. The court would have to presume that while there were sufficient inducements for Haldeman to enter into the agreement, Jennings & Co. on the other hand may have had engagements outstanding dependant upon this, making it important to them that there should be a faithful and punctual compliance on the part of Haldeman. The stipulation would cover those remote and consequential damages which the plaintiffs might have sustained by the failure of the defendant, and as they might exceed the sum stipulated, he would have no right to complain in the face of his own' agreement, if they happened to be less. But the apparent fairness of the agreement in making the stipulation mutual, has destroyed its efficacy as a contract for stipulated damages, and the law presumes against the intention of the parties however clearly expressed. The stipulation might well have been mutual if the act to be done by Jennings & Co. consisted in something other than the payment of money, and perhaps even in such case, if the sum stipulated for afailure on their part bore some fair and reasonable proportion to the gross consideration they were to have paid for the staves. We find that Jennings & Co. undertook to make advances as the work of getting out the staves progressed. Our impression is that in every case of stipulated damages, the party, who may become entitled to them, has the right to insist upon a punctual and literal compliance with the contract, or in lieu of it to have the damages agreed upon: but in every such case the voluntary acceptance of a partial performance, would be a waiver of the right, stricti juris, to recover the entire damages as for an entire breach. The contract here contemplated that there should be partial ad - vanees, to be a deduction from the price of the staves on delivery, and although the advances were to be made according to the discretion of Jennings & Co., as they might think proper and reasonable, it could hardly be intended that they had an arbitrary discretion to refuse to make any advances. If therefore, on the reasonable request of Haldeman, Jennings & Co. had refused to make any small advance, the contract would have been at an end, and they would become at once liable to pay him the entire sum of $ without any obligation on his part to proceed any further in the way of performance. But waiving that consideration, however important it may be-in determining the real intention of the parties to be different from what they have expressed, it appears that the gross price to be paid for the staves on delivery amounted to $, their admitted value, and all that Haldeman expected to get for them. Laying aside all circumlocution, the effect then, of the stipulation was: that if Jennings & Co. failed to pay Haldeman the-sum of four hundred dollars, they should at once become liable to pay five hundred dollars. Now, the recovery of the four hundred dollars at the end of a law suit, though with the allowance of interest for its detention, might be a very inadequate compensation to Haldeman as compared with the prompt payment by Jennings & Co. of the contract price: but according to our understanding of the authorities, adverted to in the case of Williams vs. Green, decided at this term and where this subject is much-considered, the rule is inflexible, that where a sum of money is stipulated to be paid in the event of failure to pay a smaller sum. it must be treated as a penalty. It results from the shape of the stipulation in this case, that being mutual and indivisible in its terms, it cannot be construed as a penalty in favor of one party, and, at the same time, be stipulated damages as against the other. The judgment of the court below must therefore b.e reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to take an enquiry of the damages which the plaintiff may have sustained by the breach of contract on the part of Haldeman. The difference, if any, in their favor, between the; price they were to have paid Ilaldeman, and what they could have realized for the staves in the New Orleans market, at the time they ought to have been delivered according to contract, would be a legitimate subject of enquiry. Without any proof, the plaintiff will only be entitled to recover nominal damages-",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862732,Levy vs. Drew,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins, delivered the opinion of the Court. The appellant sued the appellee as endorser of a promissory note past due. The endorsement was made on the 1st of February, . All the parties, maker, payee, and endorsee, resided at Little Rock, but at the date of the endorsement the maker was temporarily absent in Kentucky, from whence he returned home some time between the 10th aud 25th of the same month. Conceding every fact in favor of the endorsee, which the evidence conduced to prove, it would appear that on the 26th of February he presented the note to the maker and demanded payment of it, which was refused, of which, on the same day he notified the endorser in person, and that he looked to him for payment. The two in company then called upon the maker, who made a partial payment on the note to the endorsee, who now seeks to recover of the endorser the residue remaining unpaid. Various points are argued upon the instructions given and refused in the court below, only one of which is material to be considered, as upon that, the judgment in favor of the endorser will have to be affirmed. According to the existing law of this State, the endorsee or assignee of this note had choice of two courses to pursue. If he designed to charge the endorser, as of commercial paper, according to the law merchant, he was bound to make presentment and demand of payment from the maker, and give notice of non-payment to the endorser, according to the rules of the law merchant. Or neglecting that course, he might, after prosecuting with due diligence a fruitless suit against the maker, have had recourse against his assignor, according to the law concerning assignments, as heretofore understood and practiced in this State. In Jones vs. Robinson, Eng. , it was recognized and settled in this court, that according to the law merchant the endorsement of a note past due, was equivalent to the drawing of a new bill by the endorser upon the maker in favor of the endorsee, payable on demand. That, in order to charge the endorser in such .case, payment must be demanded of the maker within a reasonable time after the endorsement, and due notice of his refusal .given to the endorser. And that what would be a reasonable time, though depending to some extent on the situation of the parties, and the circumstances of each case, is always a question of law for the court, according as the facts might be proven or admitted. Our opinion is that if the rights and liabilities of parties to negotiable paper are sought to be ascertained and fixed according to the law merchant, new to some extent, and not generally practiced in this State, its rules, so far as applicable to our system of law, ought, for the best interests of all whom they may concern, to be adopted, as they are understood according to the most approved authorities and steadily adhered tol In this case the endorsement having the effect of a bill payable on demand, no days of grace were allowed. As the parties all resided in the same town where the endorsements were made, the endorsee was bound to make presentment and demand payment of the maker, in person, or at his usual place of business, or at his residence, on the day of the endorsement, or on the day following, and to give notice of non-payment to the endorser on the day of the presentment, or on the next succeeding day. The temporary absence of the maker did not excuse presentment at his place of business or abode. As the undertaking of the endorser was conditional that he would pay if the maker did not, upon presentment in due season, and upon his being duly notified of the maker’s default, it devolved on the endorsee to prove that he had used the diligence required of him, or such facts, if they existed, as would by law dispense with it. Without undertaking to lay down any rule of universal application, as to what constitutes reasonable diligence, it suffices here to say that the delay of the holder for days, without any attempt to make presentment, or give notice of non-payment, where the parties resided in the same place, amounted to such negligence as would discharge the endorser.

1862665,"Couch, Ex parte","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr .Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. At the October term, , of the county court of Pulaski county, certain proceedings, to which Couch was a party, touching a public road, were finally decided adversely to him. He took a bill of exceptions, filed an affidavit, and prayed an appeal to the Circuit Court, which the County Court granted. On the 6th of December following, a certified transcript of the proceedings was filed in the Circuit Court, and on the 20th of January, #; on motion of the attorney general, Couch being present and resisting, the Circuit Court dismissed the supposed cause, to which Couch, by his attorney, excepted, and sued out a writ of error to this court. There was really no cause in the Circuit Court to dismiss. The prayer for an appeal,, and the action of the County Court upon it had no legal effect to transfer the cause to the Circuit Court: nor did the filing of the transcript there, on the part of Couch, have any such effect. Not that the Circuit Court had no appellate jurisdiction of such a cause, but because no steps had been taken to invoke that jurisdiction. Such steps can be taken in the Circuit Court only in the absence of statutory regulations, touching such cases, of which we have none, beyond the act of the 21st December, , (Dig. p. , sec. ), investing the Circuit Court with intermediate appellate power, but making no regulations for its exercise. Until the Legislature shall think proper to make such regulations, the Circuit Courts, at the instance of parties, must use their common law and other means known to the law, to give effect to these intermediate appellate powers thus invested in them as (Carnall vs. Crawford county, Eng. R. at p. ), to matters properly cognizable in the County Courts, and not provided for by the act of the 4th January, , (Pamph. Act p. ). The case of Carnall vs. Crawford county, was within the provisions of this latter act and was brought into the Circuit Court in accordance with its regulations, and it was held that in such ca.ses the Legislature contemplated a qualified trial de novo in the Circuit Court, as provided for appeals from the Probate Court. Cases like this at bar, however, being unprovided for by statute, remain, as at common law, and are subject to be quashed or affirmed only in the Circuit Court, as the case may be. The process in the Circuit Court performing the functions of a writ of error, (ib. at p. ). Neither the constitution nor any statute of this State invests the county court with exclusive j urisdiction in matters of public roads, closed to superior review; on the contrary these courts are doubly open to the primary review of the Circuit Courts clothed, as they are, with constitutional power of superintending and statutory power of intermediate appeal. Doubtless, therefore, when the party in this case shall properly present his case in the Circuit Court, he will be entitled to have it heard and have the doings in the County Court either quashed or affirmed. Finding no error in the action of the Circuit Court, its doings in this case must be affirmed. Watkins, C J., not sitting»",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862731,Lovette and Wife vs. Longmire,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court. This was a bill in chancery, filed by Lovette and wife, to enjoin the sale of certain slaves taken in execution to satisfy a judgment obtained by Longmire against Lovette. The slaves are claimed by the wife as her separate property, under the provisions of the Statute, Digest, chapter , which, in certain cases exempts slaves and other property owned by the wife at the time of her marriage, or which comes to her during coverture, from sale, for the payment of the husband’s debts. It appears from the facts disclosed that on the 13th of May, , Longmire obtained judgment in the Union Circuit Court, against Lovette, in debt for $ , besides interest and costs. On the first day of December, , the slaves taken in execution came to the possession of Lovette and wife by inheritance, from Elizabeth Jamieson, the mother of Mrs. Lovette. On the 7th of November, , under the provisions of the 7th section of the act approved December 8th, , above referred to, a schedule of the property so inherited, including the slaves levied upon, was filed in the Recorder’s office, of the county of Union, it being the county in which Lovette and wife lived and held the property. On the 22d of March, , the slaves were taken in execution,, to enjoin the sale ‘of which this suit was brought. There is no doubt but that the slaves were inherited by the wife, and- held by her under the provisions of the act of , under a substantial compliance with the provisions of that statute. u But the question is, whether the statute exempts them from, liability for the payment of this debt, which was contracted before the estate vested in Mrs. Lovette, and before the schedule-was filed in the Recorder’s office. The first section of the act permits the wife to hold property,, real or personal, by bequest, devise, gift or distribution in her own right and for her own use, except such as may come from the husband after coverture. The second section continues the title of slaves in the wife which she held at the time of her marriage, notwithstanding her coverture, and allows her to hold and possess the same as her separate property, exempt from any liability for the debts or contracts of the husband. The third section confers a like right to property thus acquired before the passage of the act from the payment of debts contracted after its passage. The 9th section provides that “before any married woman can avail herself of the privileges and benefits of this act she and her husband shall make out a schedule of the property derived through her, under oath, which shall be verified by the oath of some other reputable person, which schedule shall be filed in the Recorder’s office, of the county within which the property is, as well as in which they live.” And then the 8th and last section provides that “the operation of this act shall not interfere with the collection of debts already contracted by any married man, or which shall hereafter be contracted before the filing of the schedule referred to in the preceding section.” These are the material provisions of the statute, and although the second section provides in general terms, that the wife shall hold such property exempt from any liability for the payment of the debts or contracts of the husband, still the 8th and last section in express terms, declares that this act shall not interfere with the collection of debts already contracted by a married man, or which shall afterwards be contracted before the schedule provided for in the 7th section shall have been filed, which filing is a pre-requisite to the enjoyment of the benefits of the act. In the case under consideration tbe debt was not only contracted before the passage of the act, and consequently the filing of the schedule under it, but also before the inheritance descended to the wife, and therefore comes directly within the provisions of the 8th section, unless we could, as contended for by the appellants, construe this section so as to make it apply to contracts entered into upon the faith and credit of this property whilst in the joint possession of the husband and wife, and before the schedule had been filed, as required by the provisions of the 7th section. But the 6th and 8th sections were evidently intended as limitations upon the general terms of the second section, particularly the 8th, which is clear and explicit in its terms, and is designed to limit the operation of the preceding sections. There is nothing ambiguous or doubtful in the language used, and when such is the case there is no room for construction different from the plain language used. It follows, therefore, from the conclusions at which we have arrived, that the slaves, although no doubt exempt from the payment of debts contracted by the husband after the schedule of the slaves had been filed in the Recorder’s office, were nevertheless liable to the payment of this, it being a debt contracted before the passage of the act of , under which the wife claims protection for the property. Independant of this fatal objection to the relief prayed for by the complainants, their bill was upon its face demurrable. Admit the slaves to have been theseparate property of complainant, (the wife), that they were family slaves, valued on account of long and faithful servitude, above all reasonable compensation in damages, and that one of them was inhumanly separated from her infant child, still the sale of them by the sheriff would not deprive Mrs. Lovette of a full and adequate redress at law against the purchaser for possession of the slaves. It is not alleged that by reason of the sale they would be placed beyond the reach of process at law, and as the question of the sufficiency of the bill to entitle the complainant to equitable relief, was specially re^ served in the defendant’s answer; upon that ground, as well as the first, that the slaves were subject to the payment of Long-mire’s debt, the court below should have decreed against the complainants. As a matter of practice, the decree of the Circuit Court should have been simply to dissolve the injunction and dismiss the complainant’s bill, leaving the sheriff to execute his common law process of sale. Beyond this, from the state of the pleadings, the Cir j cuit Court had no power to decree relief. The decree of the Union Circuit Court, so far as regards the dissolution of the injunction and the dismissal of the complainant’s bill was certainly correct. But so far as regards the specific relief decreed, it was clearly erroneous and must, for that error, be set aside and reversed with costs; and a decree rendered in this court in accordance with the opinion herein delivered.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862678,The State vs. Denton,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court. The defendant was indicted in the Yan Burén Circuit Court for an assault and battery, alleged to have been committed on the person of one William York. At the foot of the indictment there ■is the following endorsement: “ This indictment is preferred upon the testimony of the party injured, who was summoned on presentation and by order of the grand jury. JOHN H. BYERS, Pro. Atto.” The question is, was this endorsement sufficient under the 87th sec. Dig. ch. . That section provides that “ No indictment for any trespass on the person or property of another, not amounting to felony, shall be preferred, unless the name of the prosequtor be endorsed thereon, except where the same is preferred on the information or knowledge of one or more of the grand jury, or on the information of some public officer in the necessary discharge of his duty, or on the' testimony of some witness other than the party injured, in which case a statement of the fact shall be made at the end of the indictment and signed by the attorney for the State.” The endorsement in this case falls short of a compliance with the statute. The fact that the witness was summoned to testify, was not sufficient to supersede the necessity of his endorsement as prosecutor. If the party assaulted was permitted thus to evade the statute, he would rarely incur the responsibility of paying the costs of the prosecution, in the event of an acquittal, by endorsing himself as prosecutor, when by procuring himself to be summoned, he could by his testimony put on foot a prosecution intended to gratify his private resentment without incurring such responsibility. It may sometimes be the case that the party injured is the only witness by whom the offence can be proven, and that, because of his refusal to become prosecutor, the offender may go unpunished; but we apprehend that cases of this kind will be rare. The language of the endorsement is somewhat peculiar; it is that “the indictment is found on .the testimony of the party injured, who was summoned upon presentation, and by order of the grand jury.” This language strongly implies that the grand jury were informed, or had knowledge of the fact, and upon such information summoned the witness. If such was the fact and their information was sufficient to satisfy them, that an indictment shouldabe preferred, the endorsement would have been sufficient, if it had simply stated the fact that it was found upon the information of one or more of the grand jurors. But in the case before us, it is expressly stated that the indictment is found upon the testimony of the party injured, and the residue of the endorsement is intended to show how and under what circumstances he was brought before the grand jury. The endorsement was clearly insufficient, and the motion to quash properly sustained. Judgment affirmed.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862681,Cockrell vs. Warner,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Hempstead, Special Judge, delivered the opinion of the Court. . On the 29th of April, , Franklin S. ""Warner filed his bill of complaint against John Cockrell, alleging in substance, that on the 27th of December , the latter purchased from him a large stock of cattle and hogs, and for which he executed to him the following instrument of writing : “ On or before the first day of January, , I promise to pay to F. S. Warner, or bearer, thirty-eight bales of cotton, weighing five hundred pounds each, and an average of my crop made on Long Prairie, with ten per cent interest after maturity, for value received. December 27th, . John Cockrell;” that although Cockrell raised, gathered and bailed, on his plantation in Long Prairie, cotton exceeding thirty-eight bales of the above mentioned weight, which had been demanded after the contract matured : yet that he absolutely refused to deliver the cotton or comply with the agreement, and in violation of it shipped nearly all, if not all his cotton to New Orleans, and placed it beyond the reach of Warner, that Cockrell lived in Louisiana, where the bulk of his estate was situated, and which was under paramount liens and incumbrances, that would render any attempt to enforce the agreement in that State fruitless, even if judgment should be obtained; that he then had personal property in Lafayette county, Arkansas, consisting of negroes, cattle and hogs, sufficient to satisfy the demand, but owned no real estate; that he designed removing all his property from Arkansas into Louisiana, as soon as he could do so,conveniently, and before Warner could possibly recover damages for the infraction of the agreement, by means of the ordinary forms of law; that Cockrell, acknowledging the justice of the demand, refused to adjust or pay the same, and intended, before judgment could be obtained, fraudulently to place his property beyond the reach of legal process, and thus defeat the demand, and that from the best information Warner could obtain as to the value of cotton on the 1st of January, , his demand against Cockrell then amounted to , dollars. The bill prayed that Cockrell might be compelled to perform the agreement specifically, by delivering the thirty-eight- bales of cotton according to the agreement, or make satisfaction for its-non-performance; that an injunction be issued to prevent the removal of his property, and for general relief. The bill was verified by the affidavit of the complainant; an injunction bond given, and a writ of injunction issued according to the prayer of the bill. Cockrell answered, admitting the purchase of cattle and hogs, but denied recollecting that he gave Warner his obligation for thirty-eight bales of cotton, as alleged in the bill, and stated that he gave an obligation for about dollars and no more; that he gave , dollars for the cattle and dollars for the hogs; he admitted that he had more than bales of cotton on his plantation, but denied that Warner demanded the cotton, or any thing else, in discharge of the obligation, and averred that after its maturity, Warner gave him his own time to pay it in; he admitted that he had shipped the cotton, as alleged in the bill, as he insisted he had a right to do; he admitted he resided in Louisiana, that some of his property there was under mortgage; but that he had a large amount of property wholly unencumbered, sufficient to pay at least , dollars, which, at the filing of the bill was subject to execution; he admitted his design of removing-his property from Arkansas to Louisiana, where he resided, but not before January, ; denied any intention of avoiding the payment of the sum really due, or of defrauding Warner out of the debt, and denied generally the fraudulent designs and purposes imputed to him in the bill. The answer was verified by the affidavit of Cockrell, and he made it a cross bill against Warner, propounding interrogatories to be answered, and charging that Warner represented that he had at least head of cattle, and they would probably exceed , and that he had exceeding hogs, and confiding in this representation he, Cockrell, made the purchase, but that upon collecting them he found that Warner bad only about head of cattle, and head of hogs; he averred that he had no recollection of giving any such obligation as that alleged in the bill, and made other statements and charges, not material to be noticed; he prayed that Warner might be compelled to fully and directly answer the charges and declarations in his answer, as well as the special interrogatories propounded, ■and that an account be had and taken between them, and that Cockrell should be allowed credit for the deficiency in the cattle and hogs, and for general relief. Warner answered the cross bill, denying its charges and allegations, and the imputed misrepresentation, and in response to the interrogatories, set out the circumstances of the contract, and its breach; that Cockrell really obtained a greater number of cattle and hogs than Warner represented he had, that Cockrell had frequently expressed himself perfectly satisfied with his bargain, and that he well knew that the obligation he had executed was for thirty-eight bales of cotton, and not for money at all; that he was not entitled to any deduction or abatement; that Warner had demanded the cotton ■and required compliance with the agreement, on the part of Cockrell, and had not extended the time of payment, as alleged. This answer was verified by the affidavit of Warner. On the :8th of November, , Warner filed his supplemental bill, setting out all the previous pleadings and proceedings, and stating as new matter, that since the last term of the court he had received information confirmatory of the charge in the original bill, as to the removal of the property of Cockrell from Arkansas, and ■that Warner would lose his demand unless the same should be prevented. A fresh injunction was granted, and several slaves belonging to Cockrell seized by the sheriff, but restored to him ■on bond and security, to abide the decree of the court, and pay any sum that might be decreed against him in the case. A subpoena in chancery was issued on the supplemental bill, and executed on Cockrell personally, the 22d of November, ; but he failed to answer. The cause was finally heard on bills, answers, cross bill, answer, replications, and evidence taken, and the court decreed in favor of Warner, to the amount of , dollars and cents, with ten per cent, interest thereon, from the 3d of May, , until paid, with costs, from which decree Cockrell appealed to this court. The pleadings in the case, are carelessly prepared, and spun out to an unnecessary length, which may, in part, account for the negligent manner with which the proceedings have been conducted. Enough appears however to enable the court to decide the case on the merits, conclusively between the parties, which is de-* sirable in all instances where it is practicable, without doing ipjustice. Probably most, if not all the property thus purchased, was, running at large, and so not actually delivered. But by the contract Warner parted with his title and ownership, and Cockrell; acquired them, and from that time exercised control over the property, and appropriated it to his own use at pleasure. The general property, by the sale, vested in Cockrell, and that drew to it the possession. From the proof it is not entirely clear as to the number Cockrell actually secured, but the preponderance of evidence is, that Warner had between and head of cattle, and head of hogs, not estimating a few pork hogs reserved, and as Cockrell frequently expressed himself satisfied with his bargain, it is a fair inference that he secured the whole, or so near it, as to render the difference trifling and unimportant. The number secured by Cockrell however, would be no evidence of the number-purchased by him, because he might not have been vigilant ip securing or taking them, or used but little if any care in the bun siness, or performed it in an improper manner. This could not be the criterion. But were it otherwise, the result would be the same, because it is in proof that Cockrell was acquainted with the number and quality of the cattle and hogs, and it cannot be seriously questioned, but that he took upon himself the entire risk of obtaining the fruits of his purchase. If he was negligent or inattentive to them, suffered them to go wild for want of proper care, or could pot, or did not collect them all, the loss was his own and he could claim nothing by way of recoupment at the hands of Warner. The stock was at large — in the range, and it is manifest from the circumstances, that it was what is frequently called a “chancing bargain,” without warranty, and which, in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation, could not entitle the vendor to additional compensation for excess, nor the vendee to any abatement for deficiency. In point of fact however, we are not inclined to believe it was a losing bargain on the part of Cockrell. Although that seems to have been the prominent idea of the pleader, this was not a proper case for a specific performance, notwithstanding a bill for that purpose may be maintained in many cases of personal chattels, where there could be no adequate compensation in damages at law. Story’s Eq. . Atk. . Aderly vs. Dixon, Sim. & Stu. . Wood vs. Rowcliffe, Hare. . If, however, a man contracts for the purchase of a hundred bales of cotton, or boxes of sugar, or bags oí coffee, of a particular description or quality, or commodities of a like kind, if the contract is not specifically performed, he may generally, with a sum equal to the market price, purchase other commodities of the same kind, description, and quality, and thus attain his object and indemnify himself against loss. Story's Eq. . This case falls within that principle, and the authorities against-treating it as a question of specific performance are conclusive.. The obligation signed by Cockrell was not of that class payable in money, but dischargeable in property. It was a strict property note, payable in cotton generally, at a specified time, and no demand on the part of Warner was necessary to fix the liability of Cockrell. By its terms the latter assumed upon himself the duty of discharging it in cotton, and a failure to comply entitled the former to recover the value of the commodity on the 1st January, , when it matured. On the proof the court fixed the market value at ten cents, and might, with propriety have given as high as eleven cents per pound, on the principle that, where a party has it in his power to discharge himself from liability by the delivery of property, and fails without a sufficient excuse, the damages should be measured by the highest market value of the property at the time when it should have been delivered, Strange, . Cowen, . Sedgwick on Damages, . On this ground then, Cockrell has no right to complain. The decree is certainly warranted by the pleadings and evidence, and without specially noticing the items of recoupment claimed by Cockrell, it is sufficient 1o observe that he has suffered no injury, of which he can complain, since if every one of them had been allowed, the decree might still be for the amount for which it was rendered. "" The principal question, however, made by the appellant in this court is, that the case should have been dismissed .at the hearing on his motion, for want of jurisdiction, on .the ground that there was an adequate remedy at law, and because .a court of chancery could not decree damages for a breach of contract. The objection as to jurisdiction was not made or reserved by the pleadings, and certainly comes with an ill grace from one who, for years, has been engaged in unsuccessful resistance of .an honest and just demand. If there was a clear, adequate and unembarrassed remedy at law, he should in all fairness, have brought forward and relied on that defence, either by plea, demurrer or answer, and to surprise his adversary with it at the hearing would appear like, if it does not in fact constitute an abuse of justice. It is opposed to that fair dealing, which courts of equity demand at the hands of its suitors. After taking all the chances of a protracted litigation, contesting a cause on the merits, and being at last defeated, to allow him to bring forward that preliminary objection at the hearing bears too close an analogy to taking advantage of one’s own wrong to be encouraged, Ludlow vs. Simond, Caines Cas. Er. & ; Underhill vs. Van Cortlandt, Johns. Ch. R. . Still if the law gives a suitor thus circumstanced that advantage, he must have it without stint, because its.rules are inflexible, and its benefits, like the rains of heaven, shared by the just and the unjust alike. Now it is a general rule, that where adefendantby his answer, has put himself on the merits, and not reserved any objection to the jurisdiction of the court, on the ground that there is an adequate remedy at law, he cannot insist on it at the hearing, unless the court is wholly incompetent to grant the relief sought by the bill; as where there would be no cognizance over the subject matter. Hawley vs. Cramer, Cow. . Delafield vs. State of Illinois, Hill, . Grandin vs. Le Roy, Paige, . Livingston vs. Livingston, Johns. Ch. R. . Holmes vs. Dole, Clark’s Cha. R. . Cable vs. Martin, How. Miss. R. . Hunts vs. Clay, Lit. Sel. Cas. . And in Meux vs. Anthony, Eng. , in this court, a similar principle was decided, in which it w'as held too that a defendant in chancery, by a reservation of his objection to the jurisdiction, in his answer, might have the same benefit thereof, as if he had adopted the more concise mode of defence, by pleading or demurring; and that must be considered as settled law here, Daniell’s Ch. R. . The question then narrows itself down to this inquiry, was the court wholly incompetent to grant relief in the case; or, in other words, did the pleadings and proof develope no subject matter over which the court had jurisdiction. As a general proposition it is certainly true that a court of equity is not competent to afford redress by way of compensation, or damages, for a mere breach of contract, where the remedy at law is plain, adequate, and complete, and where no peculiar equity intervenes; and the authorities cited by the counsel of the appellant are decisive on that point. Such was the case of Dugan vs. Cureton, Ark. . In that case, however, it was intimated that if a recovery at law could not be obtained, or made available in consequence of insolvency, the court would have jurisdiction to retain a case and do justice between parties. And this too, accords with the case of Clark vs. Flint, Pick. ; where it was held that a remedy, by an action for damages against an insolvent person, is not such a plain, adequate and complete remedy at law as to deprive a court of equity of jurisdiction. In Kentucky, it has been frequently held that non-residence is sufficient to warrant a court of equity in proceeding against the property of the absentee, although it is probable that the decisions there may be influenced to some extent by a statute which exists on the subject. Golden vs. Maupin, J. J. Marsh. . Hieronymus vs. Hicks, J. J. Marsh. . Moore vs. Simpson, Lit. . Hunts vs. Clay, Lit. Sel. Cas. . These cases are cited, not to .adopt their doctrines, but to indicate to what extent respectable courts in sister states have felt themselves authorized to go in affording equitable relief. In our view it is not necessary to decide whether insolvency or non-residence, separately or together, are sufficient ground to uphold the jurisdiction of a court of equity, because, in this case we think the jurisdiction can be maintained for other and clearer reasons. •The bills charged Cockrell with a fraudulent design to defeat the collection of the demand by the removal of his property beyond our jurisdiction before the creditor could have any available and adequate remedy at law. Recurring to the answer of Cockrell, it will be perceived that it is not at all calculated to inspire confidence in his statements. He denied recollecting giving an obligation for cotton. That he did give it was amply established, not only by his own acknowledgments, but by due proof of the execution of the instrument itself. He did not absolutely deny giving the obligation, but took shelter behind his recollection, and to say the least of it, his memory must have been exceedingly treacherous. He denied the present intention to remove his property beyond the jurisdiction of the court, yet admitted that he intended to do so at a future time. Although he had received full consideration from Warner, yet, with his $,- of unencumbered property in Louisiana, subject to execution, he never offered to pay any thing, either in money or property, but was manifestly endeavoring to avoid it. The answer was evasive and unsatisfactory, and not calculated to weaken the imputations of fraud, as made in the bill and supplemental bill. The latter he entirely failed to answer, although personally notified in due form of law. Mere non-payment of a debt can never be evidence of a design to defraud, but there were circumstances attending this refusal, which gave a different hue to the transaction. Putting all the circumstances together, we think it may be safely assumed that a fraudulent design existed on his part to prevent the recovery of a just debt. The jurisdiction of a court of equity, incases of actual or constructive fraud, is too well established to be questioned on the one hand, or vindicated on the other; and as this case partakes of that character, we hold that the court had jurisdiction over the subject matter, and was competent to grant relief. And hence, the party having answered and put himself on the merits, without reserving any objection to the jurisdiction, cannot be permitted to derive any advantage from it in this forum, and under these circumstances. But were it otherwise, the jurisdiction is, in our opinion, maintainable upon another ground, to which we will now advert. The answer of Cockrell was made a cross bill against Warner, and interrogatories propounded, (Digest ), and an accounting and general relief prayed for, based on an alleged misrepresentation on the part of Warner, as to the number of cattle and hogs sold; and also on a claim to abatement for deficiency, and on a mistake in the agreement. These grounds too, were connected with the necessity of obtaining a discovery from Warner, and surely it cannot be pretended that they do not lay a sufficient foundation for equity jurisdiction. Since the case of Wheat vs. Dotson, ( Eng. ), partial failure of consideration is cognizable at law in our courts, but because there is a remedy at law it does not destroy or impair the concurrent jurisdiction of a court of equity over the same subject, but such jurisdiction still continues on its old foundations. Story's Eq. . Hempstead vs. Watkins, Eng. . Sailly vs. Elmore, Paige Ch. R. . The cross bill founded on matters clearly cognizable inequity, supplied any defect in jurisdiction, if any existed, and placed the court in- possession of the whole cause, and imposed the duty of granting relief to the party entitled to it. The original bill, and cross bill are but one cause ( Daniel's Ch. Pl. . Ark. . Johns. Ch. R. ), and it certainly cannot be at all material from what particular source jurisdiction arose, provided it existed in the case. In Logan vs. McMillin, Dana, , where a defendant denied fraud, alleging that through mistake he had not received sufficient credit, it was held that although the remedy was complete at law, yet as the subject matter of the bill and cross bill were connected, the court might take jurisdiction. The case of Wickliffe vs. Clay, Dana. , decides asimilar principle. The cross bill gives a perfect reciprocity of proof to each party derivable from the answers of each, and its object is to enable the court to make a decree on the whole merits, Story's Eq. Pl. . Johns. Ch. R. . In Missouri vs. Iowa, How. S. C. Rep. , to adjust boundaries, one State filed a bill, and the other a cross bill, and it was said by the court that each State occupied the position of a defendant, and that the whole case being before them,, such decree could be made as the case required, Draper vs. Gorden, Sand. Ch. R. . In Hall vs. Edrington, B. Mon. , it was held that although the claim of a plaintiff, in an action of' detinue for the hire of a slave, was a legal demand,"" yet if the-plaintiff be brought into chancery by the defendant in respect to the recovery of the slave and hire, the plaintiff may, by way of cross bill, have a decree for such hire, which he otherwise could not do, because his remedy at law would be perfect and complete, and his demand a legal one. These authorities will suffice to demonstrate that the original and cross bill are but one cause; that both parties are as complainants, praying relief against each other, and haying in view the object of bringing the whole controversy before the court, to the end that it may be finally settled on the merits, by such decree as the justice and equity of the case may require. In attaining this end it must frequently happen that mere legal demands on the one side or the other, over which separately a- court of equity would have no jurisdiction, have to be passed ""on and relief afforded. But this, so far from being objectionable,.is commendable, because it has a tendency to prevent a multiplicity of suits, in itself sufficient to give a court of equity jurisdiction, although the subject matter, otherwise, may be of a legal nature and of legal cognizance. In Cathcart vs. Robinson, Peters. , Chief Justice Marshall said: “it is well settled that, if the jurisdiction attaches, the court will go on to do complete justice, although in its progress it may decree on a matter which was cognizable at law.” If a bill should be filed to recover damages for a breach of contract, unaccompanied by any equitable circa instances, and where the remedy at law was perfect and complete, and the defendant, instead of demurring for want of equity, should answer on the merits and set up as cross matter, that the contract was obtained fraudulently and without consideration, and pray for its recision and for general relief; it could hardly be contended that the court on the one hand, would not have jurisdiction to decree a recision if the defence was established, or decree relief to the complainant, on the other, if the defence was unsuccessful, although in the absence of the cross bill, which placed the whole controversy before the court, no decree could be rendered on the bill standing by itself, for want of jurisdiction. The reasons for it have been, in part, intimated. The cross bill developes new ‘facts touching the same controversy within the acknowledged powers of a court of equity, and which, if true, would entitle the defendant to relief, either partial or entire. The whole case is at issue, and jurisdiction, which did not before, now appears on the record. If there is jurisdiction for one purpose, there is jurisdiction for all purposes. If a decree may be rendered for the defendant, one may be rendered against him. The court having rightful possession of the cause, will proceed to do full justice between the parties, for it is well said that the jurisdiction, having once rightfully attached, it shall be made effectual for the purposes of complete relief. Story's Eq. , (K.) Where the court has gained jurisdiction of the cause for one purpose it may retain it generally. Johns. . Cowen . In asking for equity, Cockrell was bound to do equity, which surely could not consist in withholding what was really due, drawing Warner from an equity into a legal forum, to pass through, another long and expensive litigation and probably at last be compelled to go back into equity again to make his recovery effectual. This would be to encourage a multiplicity of suits, which is against the policy of the law and to be avoided at all times and in all courts. There was nothing in the case to render a trial by jury indispensable, and if there had been, it would have been competent to direct an issue out of chancery for that purpose. Either the chancellor or master, however, were quite as competent to ascertain the value of cotton, at a specified time, as a jury would be; for certainly it was an inquiry neither complicated nor difficult, whether performed by one or the other. That Cockrell was not able to prove the cross matter set up bj| him, could not possibly defeat the jurisdiction of the court, nor affect it any more than it would be affected in a case on a bill within the acknowledged powers of a court of equity, which the complainant should fail to establish. In that contingency, he would obtain no decree, but the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter would be entirely unimpeachable. It is not inappropriate to remark that, while it is necessary to keep up the prominent boundary lines between courts of law and equity, the jurisdiction of the latter is not diminishing but enlarging, so as to keep pace with the extension of commerce, and the increasing wants of mankind. The narrow and unreasonable prejudices once entertained against that jurisdiction, have measurably, if not entirely, yielded to the intelligence and liberality of the age, and it is a truth, universally admitted, that far more injustice is done in common law courts than in courts of chancery, owing to the inability of the former to grasp the whole controversy without violating technical rules, as ancient as they are inflexible. Every one must feel that there is no danger to be apprehended from courts of chancery. It is apparent that to entertain an objection to the jurisdiction and drive Warner to assert his remedy at law against a man, who is a non-resident, and has doubtless now removed his property beyond our jurisdiction, and when that remedy could not, in the nature of things, be as complete and comprehensive as in chancery, would be to visit upon him the entire loss of his debt. We find nothing in his conduct to warrant the infliction of such .a penalty, and nothing in that of Cockrell to entitle him to such a reward. Taking into consideration the position and circumstances of the whole case, we are satisfied the objection to the jurisdiction ought not to prevail, and thinking that no injustice has been done to Cockrell by the decree, we direct it to be in all things affirmed with costs.

1862670,Conway vs. Ellison; Ellison vs. Conway,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1852-01,Ark.,"Hon. S. H. Hempstead, Special Judge, delivered the opinion of the Court. This bill was filed by Conway, to enjoin proceedings on a judgment at law, obtained by Ellison against him in the State of Tennessee, on the 24th January, , upon personal service of process. After stating that he had been appointed guardian of George M. Gray, who was a brother-law of the defendant, had sent him to Nashville, to perfect and complete his education, and paid all the expenses and charges attending the same, which were allowed him in the settlement of his accounts, had ceased to be guardian on the 13th of January, , on the ward’s reaching the age of twenty-one, and had turned over to the ward his property, the complainant alleged, in substance, that he never had any transactions with, nor did he ever owe Ellison anything individually; that in the defendant wrote one or two letters to the complainant, claiming compensation for the board of George M. Gray, to the amount of about forty dollars, to which the complainant replied by letter, that he expected to receive a large sum of money for the use of his ward, and if the account was sent duly probated, he would pay it out of his own funds: that in Ellison visited Hempstead county, where complainant resided, and saw him on many occasions, but that no claim was prefered or mentioned by Ellison, and complainant supposed that it had been adjusted by Gray, and gave himself no concern about it; that in October, , the complainant visited Nashville, Tennessee, and was there served with a writ requiring him to answer said Ellison to a plea of debt, and in which writ the complainant was described to be “Guardian of George M. Gray;” that he consulted an eminent lawyer in Nashville, and truly represented to him all the material facts of the case, who assured the complainant that the action could not be maintained nor a recovery had, without proof that he was still guardian of Gray, and the attorney pledged himself to attend to and defend the action; and see that the necessary proof was adduced to defeat it, in the event there should be no failure of evidence on the part of the plaintiff; that knowing that the claim was unfounded and never could be proven, and relying on his attorney to defeat the suit at the trial, he gave no further attention to it, and heard nothing more from it until , when an action was brought on the judgment, which appeared to have been rendered for $ debt, and $ damages and costs; that his attorney, “either by fraud and collusion with said Ellison, or from some unaccountable conduct,” failed to appear and defend the suit as he had promised to do, and judgment was rendered against the complainant by default, without the intervention of a jury, or the production of any evidence whatever to establish the demand. The defendant answered, denying the material allegations’™ the bill, and claimed the benefit of the judgment, and also set up in the answer that the defence, if available, should have been made at law, and that a court of equity had no jurisdiction to grant the relief prayed for in the bill. . The judgment of a court of another State can only be impeached for want of jurisdiction over the subject matter or person, or on the ground of fraud, and hence it is not competent for the court, where the remedy is sought, to inquire into mere irregularities, such as whether judgment was pronounced with or without a jury; or evidence was or was not adduced, or matters of a like nature; because it must be manifest, that to tolerate such objections, would be in effect to exercise a revisory power over the judgment in a collateral proceeding, and thus destroy its validity; The judgment itself closes the door to such defects, and hence if the imputed irregularities and errors in the bill had been proved, still they could have no effect whatever in the decision of this cause, Peters . Peters , . McLean . There is but one allegation which approaches towards laying a foundation for relief, and that is a general one, insinuating fraud and collusion between the attorney and Ellison, to obtain the judgment. It is not a direct charge of fraud, since it was made alternatively, and coupled with an allegation of “unaccountable conduct” in the attorney, the meaning of which is not defined, nor are we informed of what precise acts it consisted, or by what standard to be measured. As fraud is never to be presumed, it follows that, where it is relied as a ground of relief, the facts and circumstances constituting the fraud, must be stated in the bill with distinctness and precision, so that an issue will be formed which may apprize both parties of proof proper to be taken. Kennedy vs. Kennedy, Ala. . Penderton vs. Galloway, Ham. . Pleadings in equity and at law are designed to apprize parties and the court of the material facts on which the asserted right depends, and to invoke attention to the points to which testimony should be directed, Crockett vs. Lee, Wheat. . Necessity imposes it as a duty, and justice requires that the decree in all cases should conform to the allegations and proofs, and indeed, the relaxation of these rules to any great extent would be productive of confusion, uncertainty and injustice. This doctrine was in effect recognized in Blakeney vs. Ferguson, Eng. , and is not only entirely conformable to reason, but amply supported by the best authorities. James vs. McKennon, John. , . Cresset vs. Milton, Ves.jr. . Wend. . Whatever is essential to the rights of the complainant and within his knowledge ought to be alleged with such degree of certainty, as to give the defendant full information of the case he is called on to answer; or on his failure to appear and defend, that the court may decree on the face of the bill in favor of the Complainant, Daniell’s Ch. Pr. , . Story Eq. Pl. . The same precision of statement is neither required or attainable in equity as in pleadings at law, but the meaning of the rule is, that the substantial grounds of relief must be stated with such general certainty and precision, as to apprize the defendant of the tz’ue zzature of the case, and the points to which testiznony should be applied; and justice demands that in all cases, the rule should be observed. It is plain that the allegation in the bill lacks the requisite certainty in the matter of the fraud, but even if it was sufficient, no proof whatever was taken or ofiered, either express or circumstantial, to sustain it; nor was it even proved that counsel had been l’etained at all. There can be no imputation more sezious or grievous against an attorney than that by fraud or collusion with his adversaiy, he suffered azi unjust judgment to be obtained against his client, and it should not only be distinctly charged and cleai'ly pi-oved, but one so regardless of the duties and forgetful of the obligations of a high and honorable profession should be promptly stricken from its rolls. If the complainant was zzot indebted to the defendazzt, it was a strictly legal defezzce, and should have been made in the suit at law in Tennessee. Dewees vs. Richardson, A. K. Marsh. . He was bound to make it at law, and could have no relief in equity unless he shows that he was prevented from doing so, by accident, surprise or mistake, or by the fraud of the opposite party, without his own fault or negligence. Andrews vs. Fenter, Ark. . Hempstead vs. Watkins, Eng. . Lansing vs. Eddy, Johns. Ch. R. . Duncan vs. Lyon, Johns. Ch. R. . Foster vs. Wood, Johns. Ch. R. . This rule has. been too often recognized and enforced in this court to need further demonstration. It is true that where courts of law and equity have concurrent jurisdiction, a party may make his election as to the tribunal in which he will bring forward his defence. If he prefers submitting it to a court of chancery, he must neither make nor attempt a defence at law; because the tribunal to which he first submits himself, must of necessity determine the matter conclusively between the parties. Bently vs. Dillard, Eng Hempstead vs. Watkins, Eng. . And this doctiine waB re* affirmed in Arrington vs. Washington, decided at July term , by this court, and in which case it was held that the inquiry in such cases was, not what kind of defence was made, but whether a defence atlaw was attempted at all, and if so he was precluded from coming into chancery. The rule does not apply, where the defence offered is of an equitable nature, and could notbe made at law, because in that case there is but one tribunal competent to afford relief. Hawkins vs. Depreist, Munf. . Saunders vs. Marshall, Hen. & Munf. . Spencer vs. Wilson, Munf. . Fish vs. Lane, Hayw. . And it is quite immaterial whether the party defends at law or not; for in either event, he is not barred from asserting his right in equity, as to his eqitable defence, by which expression is intended a defence not available at law in any contingency whatever. But the defence set forth in the bill was not of that character. It was purely legal, unaccompanied by equitable circumstances, and no sufficient excuse has been stated to show why it was not made in the suit in Tennessee. The complainant was not ignorant of the facts on which the defence rested, for he avers that he communicated them fully to his counsel, and was informed by the latter that the action could notbe maintained, and he chose to rest easy on that advice. No accident is pretended to have prevented it, and fraud and collusion are distinctly denied and not proved. The claim for relief is narrowed down to the common case of a person, who having a strict legal defence, neglects to make it at law, and thus forever loses its benefit. Even if a retainer had been proved and gross' negligence in the counsel, unaccompanied by fraud, or unfairness, still to attempt to relieve from its consequences would be to venture into a vast ocean of litigation without chart or compass to guide us. It would, in fact, amount to an extension of privileges to one class of persons, which are denied to others, thus destroying that equality which is the boast of a court of equity, and should never be lost sight of in its decisions and decrees. The injured party, however, is not without redress; since the attorney is responsible in a civil action for damages, arising from negligence and inattention to the interests of the client. Denton vs. Noyes, Johns. . It was said correctly and pertinently, in Barrow vs. Jones, J. J. Marsh. , that “ courts cannot give redress against the other party tQ the suit, but it? must be sought in a new action. And in Lawson vs. Bettison, Eng. , this court held that where a party employed an attorney at law, either to prosecute or defend his suit in the courts of the country, he presents him to the opposite party and to the world as his accredited agent, and as such he must be concluded by his acts or omissions where no fraud or unfairness is made to appear. The bill, taking every statement on that subject to be true, fails to show due diligence on the part of the complainant; but, on the contrary, evinces that he gave himself no concern about the suit, and never attempted to furnish evidence, if any existed, to prevent a recovery, and certainly that was not the duty of the attorney. It is a cardinal rule in equity, commended by its good sense, that no man can be relieved from the consequence of negligence, carelessness or inattention; because to do that would be to make litigation endless, rob the vigilant of their advantages, and overwhelm courts of equity by the pressing multitude of slothful suitors. In their organization courts of equity are properly and necessarily vested with a large discretion, but still it is a discretion depending on established arid well defined principles, and in every view of the subject, it is clear that the complainant was not entitled to the relief prayed for in his bill, and the same should have been dismissed. Unless in aid of a suit at law, no injunction should be granted where the applicant for it does not submit to a judgment at law, or as it is technically termed — confesses judgment. Matthews vs. Douglass, Cooke . Nelson vs Owen, Iredell Ch R. . The reason is, that if he does not succeed in equity, he might still go on and defend at law, prosecute a writ of error, or take an appeal and thus unreasonably delay his adversary in the obtainment of his rights. Madd. Ch. , Vernon . No person can be allowed to litigate at law and in chancery at the same time, as to the same subject matter, and an election to resort to the latter forum, lias the effect of closing the door of the former to him, so far that if he fails his adversary may, without further litigation, avail himself of his recovery at law by means of an execution. When an action has been commenced, Lord Roslyn said a plaintiff must be permitted to go on to trial and judgment, and that the injunction only stayed execution. Franco vs. Franco, Cox . Eden lays down this rule, that “the plaintiff may proceed so far as to be able to take out execution the instant that the injunction is dissolved.” Eden on Injunctions . Therefore after an interlocutory judgment, as by default or a demurrer, the plaintiff at law may go on to ascertain his damages, P. Wms. . Daniell adopting the language of Eden, says that after the commencement of a suit at law, the plaintiff may proceed so far that he may be in a situation immediately on the dissolution of the injunction, to take out execution. Daniell's Ch. Pr. . In Warwick vs. Norvale, Leigh , it was expressly decided that an injunction can only be granted on condition that the defendant confesses judgment at law, and if a party refuses to submit to such judgment, the injunction will be denied, or if one has been granted it may for such cause be dissolved. And this is not a rule of practice to be changed or modified at pleasure, or to be enforced or not, as the chancellor shall think fit ¿ but it is one resting on ancient and well defined principles of justice and equity, and having in view the suppression of litigation and the preservation of the just rights of the adverse party. Ham vs. Schuyler, Johns. Ch. R. . As far as the record indicates in this case, the proceedings at law seem to have been arrested at the commencement, and no judgment to have been confessed at law, and if that is the fact the defendant is now entitled to judgment for his demand. If judgment was rendered he is entitled to execute it without further delay. The decree must be reversed and the cause remanded with directions to dissolve the injuction with damages according to the statute, that the defendant be allowed to proceed at law, and the bill be dismissed at the costs of the complainant.

1862668,Hutt Ex parte,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins, delivered the opinion of the Court. The petitioner represents that he is the plaintiff in a certain action at law, pending in the Pulaski Circuit Court, now in session, the suit being brought upon a promissory note, which had been assigned to the plaintiff. That the defendant in the Circuit Court, during its present term, after having oyer of the instrument sued on, demurred for a variance between the description of the plaintiff’s name as set out in the declaration and that disclosed by the instrument given on oyer. That the only variance consisted in this, that the plaintiff sued as Andre, and the assignment as filled up, and which was done by the plaintiff’s attorney through mere inadvertence was Andrew,it being the same Christian name, according as it is spelt in French or English. That the court there has sustained the demurrer for the supposed variance, and thereupon the plaintiff, by leave of the court, has corrected the mistake in the filling up of the assignment, by inserting Andre instead of Andrew, That the defendant making no further defence, the plaintiff moved for judgment for want of a plea; but the court there has, on motion of the defendant, and without any showing being made therefor, ordered the cause to be continued until the next term, thereby denying the petitioner his legal right to have judgment for his debt; wherefore he prays that a mandamus issue against the judge of that court commanding him to set aside the order of continuance and progress with the cause. It will be conceded that a mandamus is the only adequate specific remedy for a suitor, where the inferior court refuses to exqrcise its jurisdiction, and will not proceed to adjudicate a cause pending before it, of which it has cognizance, and where no reason appears for such refusal. The mandamus will go to compel the court to act, but not to control its judicial discretion, by directing it what judgment to give, or to review the correctness of any decision made during the progress of a cause; else the mandamus would become an indirect substitute for the final review by writ of error or appeal. The proceeding by mandamus to compel a Circuit Judge, sitting as a chancellor, to grant an injunction as prayed upon any given case presented to him by the bill, and which he has refused, is in the nature of an. appeal allowed by statute, from some interlocutory order or decree of the inferior court. According to the report of Dixon vs. Feild, Eng. , mainly relied on by the petitioner here, it was, as we think, an extreme case to warrant the issuance of a mandamus. But admitting, upon the authority of the opinion in that case, that a mandamus will lie to control the discretion of the inferior court in the continuance of a cause, where that discretion is so palpably abused as to amount to a denial of justice, the case here is different. The court below decided the demurrer. If the petitioner was aggrieved by the decision, his only remedy was to rest upon it and suffer final judgment, which could be reviewed on a writ of error of appeal. He might then require this court to decide whether the ground of demurrer was frivolous, or the variance so trifling as to he amendable, without occasioning any surprise or pretext for delay to the defendant. The petitioner acquiesced in the decision upon the demurrer by making the amendment conformable with iff According to the case presented by the petition, it will be impossible to grant the mandamus without reviewing the correctness of that decision. By the 6th rule of practice for the Circuit Courts, adopted by this court at July term , when a demurrer to a declaration is sustained, the demurrant is entitled to a continuance of the cause: and while that rule remains in force, the continuance follows of necessity from the decision of the court sustaining the demurrer, no matter how erroneous in point of law.

1862689,"Merrick & Fenno vs. Avery, Wayne & Co.","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. This was a suit in chancery, instituted by the appellees, Avery, Wayne & Co., Thomas Hite and others, against Merrick & Fenno, and William Fisher. From the record sent here, the material facts of the case appear ;to be as follows : The complainants residing at Cincinnati, Ohio, having furnished supplies to the steamboat P. H. White, then running in the Ohio river, and owned by William Fisher, settled their respective demands against the boat, on the 7th August, , by taking the note in some instances of the owner, and in others of the master of the boat, either due presently or at so many days from date. Soon afterwards the boat left the Ohio, and in the latter part of August, was brought by Fisher into the Arkansas, -where she continued to run. While navigating the Arkansas river the boat became indebted to the defendants, Merrick & Fenno, residing at Little Rock, for advances and supplies furnished in this State, amounting to near four hundred dollars; and -on the 6th of October, , they took a bill of sale of the boat from Fisher, expressed to be in consideration of their having just ■claims against the boat, which he was desirous should be paid. The bill of sale contained a stipulation to the effect, that when .all the claims then held by Merrick & Fenno should be paid and satisfied, they would in good faith, re-sell, re-convey, and re-deliver the boat, her engine, tackle, &c., to Fisher, on his reasonable request, and in the meantime render accounts of the business of the boat, or permit him to inspect its books on request. This instrument, which clearly was a mortgage security, was never filed for record. It is fully proved that Merrick & Fenno, notwithstanding the positive denial and averments in their answer, immediately upon the execution of the bill of sale, took possession of the boat and commenced running her, for the purpose of re-imbursing what she owed them, and that such was the intention of the parties in executing the bill of sale, is inferable from its tenor. Whether the boat left the Ohio river with the knowledge or consent of the complainants does not appear. Down to the time of taking the bill of sale so called, Merrick & Fenno had no notice of the claims of the Ohio creditors against the boat, but of which they were shortly afterwards apprized. Those creditors pursued Fisher to Arkansas, and brought suits in personam, against him* for the amount of their respective demands, in all of which judgments were rendered against Fisher, on the common law side of' the Pulaski Circuit Court, on the 25th April, . In the meantime the boat, not paying the expenses of running; her, and continuing to fall in debt to Merrick & Fenno, so that-including what they had advanced before undertaking to run the-boat for Fisher’s account, she owed them for supplies, stores,, cash advances, wharfage, &c., a balance of $,, and on the-7th of June, , they advertised her for sale at auction on the-19th day of that month. Two days before this sale took place, the complainants filed-their bill, the scope of which was, that by the law of Ohio, their claims were liens upon the boat, entitled to be specifically enforced and satisfied against her, in preference to any claim which the defendants, Merrick & Fenno, might have subsequently acquired. The complainants had. caused executions to be issued upon their judgments at law against Fisher, which being returned milla bona they claimed, in another aspect of their bill, to be entitled in equity, as judgment creditors of his, to subject the boat or its proceeds in the hands of Merrick & Fenno to satisfy the judgments; upon the ground that Merrick & Fenno had no real or valid claim, and in respect of which they prayed a discovery and account, but only held possession of the boat as trustees for Fisher. The boat, when sold, did not bring enough to pay the balance due Merrick & Fenno, who received the proceeds of the sale,., amounting to $,. At the hearing it was agreed that the law of Ohio, in regard to claims against boats and vessels, should be read in evidence, and it was admitted that the supplies &c., originally furnished by the complainants in Ohio, were such as 'were provided for by that law. The chancellor allowed Merrick & Fenno to retain the amount of their demand, being four hundred dollars, against the boat at the time of the execution of the mortgage, but decreed that they should pay the residue of the proceeds arising from the sale, to be distributed pro rata among the complainants. While the appellants contend that the complainants below had no lien, it is argued that, conceding they might have had such lien, they lost it by taking notes of the master or owner, thereby giving a personal credit to them, and also by merging their demands in judgments against the owner. If these were the only questions to be decided, we might have no difficulty in holding, that where by analogy to maritime law or usage, a material man has a triple remedy against the master, the owner, and the boat, he may pursue them all, independently of each other, until one satisfaction is had. In such cases a reasonable credit is allowed to be extended to the boat for the benefit of commerce, else there would be no necessity for any lien. So the taking of a note not negotiated or outstanding would not waive the lien, unless some additional security were obtained, or under circumstances manifesting an intention to do so. According to what is the law of the place, the simple contract demand might be merged in the note, and a judgment in personam would bar another action on the note; but that judgment while unsatisfied, being but a security, would be no bar to a distinct proceeding in romiot the same debt, supposing such were the case here. But the essential enquiry is, whether the complainants upon the facts stated, had any lien in Ohio, which they can enforce in this State as against the defendants, and this enquiry involves many considerations of serious difficulty. In the first place the the distinction between the different kinds of lien is to be observed. The common law lien is a right to retain a thing until some claim upon it is satisfied, and if possession be given up the lien is lost. Statutory liens, among which are chattel mortgages, do not depend upon possession of the thing. They import a right to prior satisfaction out of the property bound by the lien, and being the creatures of positive law, are usually regiilated by a system of registry, operating as constructive notice; so that they take effect, and are to be satisfied according to priority of record! A maritime lien does not depend upon possession or registry of any contract which confers the lien. It excludes the idea of possession or registry. Nor do such liens take effect according to priority of time; in many instances, when they come to be satisfied the order of priority is inverted. The maritime law is part of the law of nations, a peculiar system supposed to be based on principles of the most enlightened equity, and proceeding according to rules of its own wholly unlike the common law. It concerns vessels which navigate the seas,- and the classes of persons engaged in navigating, or who contract in respect of such vessels! The maritime lien is one of the necessities attending commerce between foreign countries. It is a claim upon the vessel and the lien consists in the right to enforce it by seizure or proceeding in rent. Unlike the liens given by the local law of any nation, which if respected out of its jurisdiction, are only so by comity, this light to satisfaction out of the vessel, where it exists,' adheres to and follows her everywhere. So the judgment of the admiralty court in rem is of universal obligation, and conclusive upon all persons interested in the subject of its adjudication. By the federal constitution, the"" judicial power of the United States extends to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. The States, for wise reasons, divested' themselves of all right to exercise any jurisdiction over the subject, unless in the absence of any legislation by Congress, or by its sufferance or permission. Congress by the judiciary act of , in organizing the federal courts, conferred original jurisdiction in all such cases exclusively upon the district courts, saving to suitors in all cases, the right of a common law remedy, where the common law is competent to afford it. The courts of the United States, unconsciously adopting the prevailing practice and definition of admirality jurisdiction in England, and without considering its true nature and design, were not disposed to extend their jurisdiction beyond cases occurring upon the high seas, or where the tide ebbs and flows; The Jefferson, Wheat. ; Thackeray vs. The Farmer, Gilpin : and the decisions of the State courts have proceeded upon the idea that all authority, though in the nature of admiralty jurisdiction, not falling within that definition, rightfully belonged or had been relinquished to therm At an early day the necessity arose for local legislation on this subject in the Atlantic States. In New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania liens were given by statute to mariners, and to those building, equipping, or furnishing materials for ships in domestic ports. The United States courts in admiralty recognized and enforced such liens where they were expressly given by the local laws. But these statutes were carefully guarded, and their beneficial operation was to extend the privilege of the maritime lien upon seagoing vessels, for their building or equipment in domestic ports, just as that lien existed in Europe, and would have prevailed in England, and so descended to this country, but for the jealousy of the common law. The States, for all the purpose of admiralty jurisdiction, were regarded as foreign to each other; the maritime lien attached to ships belonging to one State, repaired or equipped in the ports of another State; and any local legislation attempting to limit or control this jurisdintion, would be disregarded, as unconstitutional; The Barque Chusan, Story . The growing commerce of the new States upon the waters of the Mississippi, where the admiralty courts never had assumed jurisdiction in any form, required som'e legislation of a different character for affording prompt and efficient remedies against boats and vessels. The statute of Ohio passed in , enacts “that steamboats and other water crafts navigating the waters within or bordering upon this State, shall be liable for debts contracted on account thereof, by the master, owner, steward, consignee, or other agent, for materials, supplies or labor, in the building, repairing, furnishing or equipping the same, or due for wharfage; and also for damages arising out of any contract for the transportation of goods or persons, or for injuries done to persons or property by such craft, or for any damage or injury done by the captain, mate, or other officer thereof, or by any person under order or sanction of either of them, to any person who may be a passenger or hand on such steamboat, or other water craft, at the time of the infliction of such damage or injury.” For any such demand the person aggrieved may proceed against the master and owner, or against the craft itself. The remaining sections provide, that upon complaint, an affidavit being made, the vessel may be seized, and unless security be put in on behalf of the owner, it is held in the custody of the court, and sold on execution to satisfy such judgment as may be rendered; the overplus of proceeds if any being returned to the owner or his agent, and if the proceeds of the sale fall short of satisfying the judgment, the balance remains to be collected ®n execution as upon ordinary judgments. In the case of The Velocity, Law Reporter , decided by Judge Conklin, of the northern district of New York, the question was whether material men, claiming a lien under this law of Ohio for supplies furnished in that State to a vessel subsequently libelled and sold under proceedings in admiralty in New York, could have their claims satisfied out of the surplus proceeds in court arising from the sale of the vessel. As the admiralty courts would enforce liens of a maritime nature, when made so by local statutes, such claimants would also be allowed to come in for a share of any surplus proceeds. The question was therefore presented, whether the statute of Ohio gave any such lien, and upon a thorough review of it, Judge Conklin was of opinion, that it did not confer a lien either expressly or by necessary implication. He refers to the legislation in the Atlantic States, and quotes the provisions of the New York statute, which explicitly gave a lien on vessels, subordinate to that of seamen’s wages, for work and materials, and stores furnished within that State, and so for wharfage and port expenses, which liens are accurately defined, and limited in duration, and the mode of enforcing- them prescribed so as to ensure publicity, and an opportunity for all claimants to interplead. And after contrasting the provisions of the Ohio statute, which neither contained the word “lien” or any expression of like import, which made the boat liable, not merely to mechanics and material men, but for all damages though unliquidated, arising from any breach of contract in the transportation of freight or passengers, or for injuries to the same, and for torts committed by any officer of the boat without limit as to place of injury or duration of the liability for it, and without any safeguards to ensure'to adverse claimants publicity in the adjudication, his opinion was “that in declaring a vessel liable for debts contracted on her account, and for the damages specified in the act, nothing more was intended than to confer the privilege of arresting the vessel by mesne process as the property of the delinquent party, and unless security should be given, of having it detained in the custody of the law to satisfy the judgment, if any, which the plaintiff might recover.” In short, that it was nothing more than a special attachment law where the process is against the boat instead of the person, and the lien is by virtue of the levy of the attachment. In the subsequent case of Glenny vs. The Globe, Law. Rep. , Judge Conklin carried the foregoing views to a much greater extent. The case was that the Globe, a Michigan vessel, owned in Detroit, was libelled by Glenny, in May, , in the admiralty court in New York, under the act of Congress of , for supplies and materials, which he had furnished to her at Buffalo, prior to the 10th of September, . A claimant of the vessel answered that she had been sued and seized in a court of Ohio under the statute of that State, for supplies furnished to her at Cleveland after the 20th of September, , in which suits judgr ments were rendered in February, , upon which the vessel was sold in March following, and under that sale he derived his title. Judge Conklin thought the Ohio statute was void, because against natural justice, inasmuch as it did not contemplate or profess to provide any means of notice, actual or constructive, beyond the act of seizure, of the pendency of the suit to adverse claimants; and that the State court had no jurisdiction, because the statute was an interference with the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States courts. Though his opinion may be a forcible argument against the policy, if not the validity of the Ohio statute, the decision was reversed on appeal to the Circuit Court. The Globe, Law. Rep. . Judge Nelson held that the State Court had a concurrent jurisdiction, reserved to it by the act of Congress of , that its judgment was, upon a proceeding in rem, obligatory upon all the world, not affected by the absence of notice to any party interested, and that the sale under it passed a complete title to the purchaser. His opinion, however, might have rested on another ground, stated as existing in the case, that the libellant had appeared to the suits in Ohio, and contested the proceedings. The statute of Wisconsin is almost the same in terms as that of Ohio, and in the case of Pulteny vs. The Sloop Celestino, Am. Law Journal , where a domestic vessel was libelled in admiralty by domestic creditors, under the act of , the district judge refused to entertain jurisdiction because the statute of Wisconsin did not confer a lien which the courts of the United States in admiralty could recognize. In the case of Davis vs. A New Brig, Gilpin , Judge Hopicinson entertained jurisdiction in such a case, upon the phraseology of the Pennsylvania statute, making vessels in certain cases liable to workmen, material men, &c., “ in preference to and before any other debts due and owing from the owners thereof.” So the Arkansas statute on this subject gives a similar preference to certain classes of creditors against the boat, over all other debts due from her owners, (except wages of mariners and boatmen,) which might materially influence the construction to be given to it. The Supreme Court of Missouri decided in Noble vs. The steamboat St. Anthony, Missouri, , See also, The steamboat Rariton vs. Pollard, ib. ; that the water craft law of that State, authorizing suits against boats and vessels, had no extra territorial operation, and would only be enforced in the courts of that State for demands accruing within the State against vessels navigating its waters. In the case in Missouri, it was admitted that the plaintiff’s claim accrued against the boat while in Pennsylvania, where by statute it was a lien upon the vessel. The court said: “The Pennsylvania law, like ours, is local and must be enforced in the mode pointed out in their statute, and in the courts acquiring jurisdiction under it. Our statute does not authorize the lien acquired under the laws of Pennsylvania to be enforced here, and there is no principle of common or international law which will justify sucha pretension.” Yet the same court, in Finney vs. The steam boat Fayette, Missouri, , not appearing to take any distinction between a domestic and foreign judgment, accord.ed to a proceeding in Illinois, under a like statute of that State, for the attachment of boats and vessels, the conclusive and uni•versal obligation of an admiralty sentence in rem. In Frink vs. King, Scam. , it was held that, under their statute, the affidavit to obtain process would be clearly defective, jf it did not state that the claimant’s services on the boat had been rendered whilst she was running in the navigable waters of fhat State., In Louisiana, as would appear from the case of Lee vs. His creditors, Annual Rep. , the privilege or lien on boats owned, or coming within the jurisdiction of that State, for work or materials furnished, is limited to sixty days, and in the distribution of proceeds among creditors, priorities are regulated by the law of the place where the vessel is found, disregarding privileges given by the law of the place where the contract was made, and though, as in that case, the contest was among non-resident claimants. The Supreme Court of Michigan, in Robinson vs. The steam boat Red Jacket, Mich. , decided upon the statute of that State, passed in , providing for the collection of demands against boats and vessels, that it only gave a new and cumulative remedy, and as it did not give a lien on the vessel until seizure under the attachment, there was no reason why foreign creditors should not be allowed to come into the courts of Michigan and avail themselves of the remedy to assert their claims against a boat. See also, Moses vs. The steam boat Missouri, ib. . But under the construction of a subsequent statute, passed, in , and. which gave a specific lien on vessels in favor of certain demands,, the court, were constrained, much against their views of its policy or propriety, to limit its operation to contracts made and injuries-received within that State. Bidwell vs. Whitaker, ib. . The construction of the water craft law of Ohio has been the-occasion of much difficulty to her own courts. Notwithstanding; what was said in The steamboat Monarch vs. Finley, Ohio, , that the law in question gives a lien upon crafts for certain, claims against them, the court, in the case of The Canal boat Huron vs. Simmons, Ohio, , take a clear distinction betweem the statute of New York, which is a lien law, and that of Ohio,., which treats the boat as a person, and makes it responsible for all debts contracted for its use and for injuries done by its officers and crew. And in Jones vs. The steamboat Commerce, Ohio, , it was directly decided that the statute in question gives no lien except by providing for the seizure of the craft, which binds the property and creates the lien. Although this construction made the statute nothing more than an attachment law, it could not be used as a remedy for the collection of demands or for causes of action' which accrued beyond the limits of that State, Champion vs. Juntzen, Ohio, , Goodsell vs. The brig Lewis, ib. ; and this, notwithstanding the supplies were furnished in Michigan, where by comity under a like statute, Ohio creditors ■ might have sued. The Ohio law continued to be so construed until , when,, by statute its operation was extended to all cases, whether they arose within or without the territory of the State of Ohio. The schooner Aurora vs. Dobbie, Ohio, . And yet the Supreme Court of that State, following the leaning of previous cases, decided in Prevost vs. Wilson, Ohio, , that a mortgage upon a vessel, executed and duly registered in-New York, where she belonged, should be .postponed to demands against the vessel subsequently accrued in Ohio, where she was attached under the water craft law. And so it was held in Johnson vs. Rogers & Sherlock, West. Law Journ. , that the statutory debts against a steamboat must be first paid in preference to a prior mortgage. The court argued, that if the lien of the mortgage could take precedence over a subsequent seizure, it leads to this result, that if a steamboat or other water craft is under mortgage, no suit could be prosecuted against her, notwithstanding the provisions of the law of ; and to give the statute that construction would be to add to it a proviso, “ that such boat shall^not be encumbered by mortgage,” affording the owners of boats a very convenient method of avoiding the force of the act. And in Johnson vs. Rogers & Sherlock, the court concluded that “ it was the object of the Legislature to enable a mechanic who labored on a boat, or any party supplying her with necessaries, to retain a lien on her superior to that even of any owner or mortgagee.” Because, as the court said, he who takes a chattel mortgage on a boat may protect his mortgage if he will keep the boat in his possession, but the moment he suffers her to run on the river, he gives a license to those in charge of her to contract debts on the faith of the boat, which shall attach as a lien superior to his mortgage. This principle is of the essence of a maritime lien, anfi the court there stated the true ground on which it proceeds, that is, the implied authority of those having a vessel in charge, to make her liable to all who labor or furnish materials on the faith of the boat, without regard to her owners. At the same time the Ohio statute is so unlike a maritime law that it does not purport to give any lien for the wages of mariners or boatmen, and it was not without a struggle against the strong opinion of part of the court, Lewis vs. The schooner Cleveland, Ohio, , that they were admitted at all as claims against the vessel. Amidst all this apparent confusion and uncertainty, the argument, fairly stated in favor of the parties here claiming a lien under the law of Ohioj may be considered as having much, force. We find that the proceedings against boats and vessels, under the various local laws of the States, have always assimilated themselves to proceedings in admiralty. The judgment in rem, is usually held conclusive every where, upon all those interested in the boat, or having demands against her, prior to the condemnation and sale. See also, The steamboat Rover vs. Stiles, Blackford, . Steamboat Raritan vs. Smith, Missouri, . Where the statute gives a lien, in the nature of a maritime lien, the courts of admiralty have enforced it as such, paramount to any sale or mortgage by the owner, Peroux vs. Howard, Peters ; and in The Jerusalem Gallison, , a local common law lien was so enforced. The schooner Marion, Story . The rule in admiralty is adhered to, that as between claims which rank in the same class, or where no preferences are given by the statute, or -where it makes the lien to consist in the seizure, the diligent creditor who first seizes has the preference, and other claimants are to be satisfied out of the res, in the order of their suits, The People vs. The Judges of New York, Wend. ; opinion of Judge Nelson in the Globe. There would seem to be the same necessity for a law of our inland rivers as for a law of the seas. The interests involved are equally important. Steamboats are no more chattels than ships, and no less migratory between ports in jurisdictions foreign to each other. In most of the leading subjects of admiralty jurisdiction, the analogies are the same, and the like reasons exist why certain liabilities should attach specifically to the vessel. It might be said, that though the Ohio statute gives no lien, it gives the claim against the vessel, and the right to seize in satisfaction of that claim; and this is the substance of a maritime lien. The rightto proceed against the res in admiralty, is called a lien, but it is by no means an absolute or unqualified right of preference. For it is a settled principle of the maritime law, though the rules on the subject rest much in discretion and are not clearly defined, that all such liens ought to be enforced by suit within a reasonable time, and they may be waived, postponed, or lost by neglect. The leading idea which pervades these local statutes is, that the boat and the owner are distinct from each other, so that the boat js liable, as it were apon her own contracts, or for her own torts. The master or owner may be liable in personam, for the same, ,and the boat may be liable for the general debts of the owner; but the boat is first liable for her own debts, which, by analogy •with the maritime law, ought to follow her every where, and without regard to any sale, or incumbrance upon her by contract of the owner, into the hands of a purchaser with or without notice. But admitting that the policy of the Ohio statute is to confer a lien, though it does not do so in express terms, there are opposing reasons conclusive to our minds, why such a lien should not be specifically enforced in this forum, in preference to any subsequent lien or liability,, valid by the laws of this State, which has accrued against the same vessel, whilst engaged in navigating our waters. In coming to this conclusion we are not influenced by the refusal of the Ohio courts to acknowledge a reciprocal obligation to enforce similar liens, which accrued in other States. For that matter, the amendment to the statute of Ohio in , allowing foreigners to pursue in that State the remedy against boats given by her own law, is inconsistent with the idea of enforcing a specific lien which accrued under a foreign law. In admiralty cases it is the nature of the contract or liability, which confers jurisdiction, without reference to the law of the country where the liability was incurred, the contract made, or to be performed; or as regards the federal courts, the citizenship of the parties. Because the admiralty law is one of universal obligation, pervading all countries where its rules are in theory at least, the same. If, therefore, the courts of this State could be called on to enforce, by analogy to the maritime law, a lien upon a boat or vessel, which accrued in Ohio, we would not do so upon any rule of comity between States, foreign, or in some respects foreign to each other. We should enforce it, not because the local law of Ohio had given the lien; but because the maritime law or usage gave it. Wo question ought to arise of conflict between the laws of this ,or a foreign State, or whether we would enforce such lien, provided it did not interfere with the rights of our own citizens, but because the lien, valid in one place, is valid every where, and followed the vessel into this State. Upon the same principle we should respect a judgment in rem, with all its conclusive consequences, pronounced in the court of an'other State. But by act of Congress, in , the admiralty jurisdiction of the district courts was extended over the lakes and rivers connecting the same. The constitutionality of this act was sustained by the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of 'The propeller Genesee Chief vs. Fitzhugh, Howard, , a decision fraught with the most important results. The court, overruling the case of the Jefferson, held that the grant of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction was of the subject matter over public navigable waters, where commerce maybe carried on between different States or nations, and not according to the accidental defininition of it in England, where tide water and navigable water are, with unimportant exceptions, if any, synonymous terms.Upon the same distinction the States had not hesitated to extend their rights of sovereignty over inland navigable streams. The decision in Howard, was the unavoidable consequence of admitting the several States to be sovereign and foreign to each other, in respect of all powers and jurisdictions, not delegated to’ the Federal Union. It follows from the reasoning in that case, that the judicial power of the federal courts in admiralty, heretofore dormant*» really extends over all public navigable rivers, by means of which intercourse may be carried on between different States. If this be so, it is difficult to conceive how any vestige of such jurisdiction (apart from disputes about its confines) could exist in the' State courts. The act of , apparently framed as a cautious-experiment adapted to the exigencies of commerce upon the lakes,, does not confer it upon them, but only leaves to suitors the option, which they had under the judiciary act of , of pursuing' any concurrent remedies that may be afforded by the State laws.But those are common law remedies, and though moulded by statute to resemble admiralty proceedings, the lien is local and the' sentence of condemnation upon it can have no more extra territorial operation than a discharge under a State bankrupt law, or a judgment in rem, upon an ordinai-y attachment suit, which, however conclusive upon persons and property found within the State, would not conclude the paramount title of any one beyond the jurisdiction, and who could not be made subject to it. In the absence of legislation by Congress, now certainly much needed, extending the admiralty jurisdiction over our western rivers, it would be unwise and impolitic for the State courts to assume any such jurisdiction, dependant on the caprice o r vicissitudes of local legislation. The decisions of the State courts, proceeding according to the course of the common law, and without any common appellate tribunal to harmonize inevitable conflicts, would only render more insecure the titles to the vast amount of property passing between different States. The owner of a vessel in such case would seldom realize its value, because the purchaser could not know whether it was free from incumbrance. The only safety is found to be in the settled aversion of the common law, which couples the idea of a lien with possession, to all restrictions, in the shape of secret or contingent liens, upon the alienation of personal property. Chattel mortgages, where the mortgager, being entrusted with the possession, is enabled to practice a fraud upon innocent purchasers in another State, are but hazardous securities, and there would be no imperative obligation upon the foreign jurisdiction to prefer the claim of the mortgagee pursuing the property, though he come in the character of owner, having title by contract. In every view of this case, we must say, that if the Ohio claimants, now before the court, had any lien by the law of that State, it was lost when they suffered the boat to depart beyond the jurisdiction of Ohio. Regarding the suit as a creditor’s bill, and without considering any objection to the form of it as such, the relief sought must also be denied.. Waiving any doubt as to the correctness of the decision in Main vs. Alexander, Eng. , and conceding that Merrick & Fenno had no lien either by virtue of a mortgage recorded, or a pledge in possession, in the absence of any allegation or proof of a fraudulent combination with Fisher, his deed of mortgage to them was certainly valid and binding, as between the parties to it. The complainants seeking equity, and within the scope of the bill, could only charge Merrick & Fenno, as the trustee, or debtor of Fisher, for such residue as might remain in their hands after their admitted claims against him were satisfied. Decree, that the relief sought by the complainants be denied, and the bill dismissed.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862672,Owen vs. Lavine,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. This was a suit originally commenced before a justice of the peace, by Lavine against Owen, upon the following instrument of writing, filed with the magistrate as the foundation of the complaint : “Hillsboro, January, . Mr. E. M. Owen, Please pay B. Lavine, or order, forty-four - dollars, value .received, out of the proceeds of my present crop of cotton. . (signed) , W. L. FOSTER. (Endorsed), I accept the within order, January, . (signed) E. M. OWEN.” At the trial de novo, in the Circuit Court upon appeal, judgment went against Owen for the amount of money specified in the order, and it appears from his bill of exceptions, that he objected to the reading of the instrument sued on, because it disclosed no cause of action against him; this objection being overruled and the instrument admitted as evidence, the proof on behalf of Owen, was, that he had a lien on Foster’s crop of cotton, and was to have the shipping of it, and when he accepted the order in question, he expected to pay it, after deducting what Foster owed him, out of the proceeds when he should receive the same. That Foster, without Owen’s knowledge or authority, caused the cotton to be shipped to New Orleans, by one Brooks, who received the proceeds: that Brooks, afterwards, upon the demand of Owen, paid him a part only of what Foster owed him. The court, on the motion of Lavine, instructed the jury, that the instrument sued on furnished sufficient evidence to them of indebtedness without looking to any other testimony, and refused, at the request of Owen, to instruct, that in order to entitle the plaintiff to recover, he must prove that defendant got possession-. of the proceeds of the crop of cotton mentioned in the draft sued on. The draft or order, in question, was not a bill of exchange, according to the law merchant; because it was drawn payable upon a contingency; that is, out of a particular fund, which the drawee might not have on hand, belonging to the drawer, or which might prove""deficient in amount, and could not be put into circulation as a negotiable instrument, payable at all events, and based on the personal credit of the drawer. So it was ruled in Hamilton vs. Myrick & Williamson, Ark. , where, apart from other questions there involved, the case may be thus stated; that Hamilton made an order in writing upon his merchants in New Orleans, directing- them to pay to one Poor or order, a certain sum of money, “out of the money received on my account from the insurance office when collected;” and which order Poor endorsed to, Myrick, who sued Hamilton upon it, alleging that the merchants, to whom the order was addressed, had collected the money in question from the Insurance Company; but that they refused to, pay the order, when presented to them for payment, whereupon it was protested, and of which Hamilton had due notice, &c. The court there held that under the statutory provision, Digest , section , the term “bill of exchange,” as used in that act, should be so construed as to include “all drafts or orders, drawn by one person on another for the payment of a sum of money specified therein,” did not mean to imply that the fund might be contingent, or to make any change in the law merchant as to the essential requisites of a bill of exchange; and so it might be questionable whether that provision would have the effect to extend the rules applicable to bills of exchange, to checks on bankers and the like. And in Gwin vs. Roberts, ib. , Roberts had drawn an order on Saugrain, requesting him to let one Chambevs have thirty doR lars in merchandise, out of his store; Chambers assigned the order to Gwin, who presented it to Saugrain, and he refused to accept or pay it. Gwin sued Roberts upon the order, and the «court there held that it could not be regarded as a bond, bill, promissory note, draft or order, within the operation of the law merchant, or any statutory provision in force in this State, or assignable, so as to vest in the assignee a legal right of action against the drawer, and intimated that the plaintiff had misconceived his remedy — that is, we infer, he might have sued Chambers to recover back the consideration paid him for the assignment, and Chambers, in turn, would have had a like recourse upon Roberts, the drawer. In both of those cases the orders, not being bills of exchange, and not having been accepted by the drawees, were incomplete as assignable contracts. But the statute of assignments (commented upon in Walker vs. Johnson, Ark. ), makes all bonds, bills, notes, agreements and contracts in writing for the payment of money or property assignable, so as to enable any assignee to sue for the same in his own name, and so having the legal interest ’he must sue, as held in Block vs. Walker Ark. , followed in several cases. True, the law merchant is, to a certain extent, introduced by the 9th section of the statute concerning assignments, but the doctrine of assignments, and the rules of the law merchant are essentially different, as noticed in Walker vs. Johnson. That section makes endorsers or assignors, upon receiving due notice of non-payment, primarily liable to the holder of “ any instrument in writing, assignable by law for the payment of money alone.” Upon the construction of this section, cai'rying out the principle asserted by Hamilton vs. Myrick and Williamson, in regard to bills of exchange, it might be proper to hold that promissory notes, payable upon a contingency, are not negotiable according to the law merchant. But that issue is not the question here. A promissory note, or any other contract in writing, though not negotiable because payable in property or upon’a contingency's nevertheless assignable, so as to vest a right of action in the assignee against the maker or obligor. That such is the law in this State has never been doubted. The broad and comprehensive terms of the first section of the statute of assignments does away with the common law doctrine of maintainance as to all the instruments in writing embraced in it. Supposing the term “bills” there used does not mean a bill of exchange or order, but bills single, or sealed notes, as they are sometimes called in the western States, yet according to the spirit of the statute, the instrument here sued upon must be regarded as a contract or agreement completed by the acceptance of Owen, assignable by law, and upon which, for' any breach of it, he is liable to any holder or assignee. It does not follow that upon such a contract the payee or endorsee could hold the drawer, or any intermediate assignor primarily liable upon notice of non-payment by the acceptor. But the contract here is the same in effect, as if Owen had made his promissory note payable to Foster, in property or upon a contingency, and Foster had assigned it to Lavine. There is no reason for allowing the acceptor, who intended to become the principal debtor, to repudiate the contract because of the shape in which he chose to make himself a party to it. If the instrument in question was any contract at all on the part of Owen, then according to our statutory rules of practice, it imported a consideration, and the execution of it need not be proved, unless denied by plea under oath; so that it was properly made the foundation of the complaint, and the Circuit Court decided correctly in admitting it to be read as part of the plaintiff’s case before the jury. No importance is attached to the circumstance, which, however, exists in this case, that the suit, having been commenced before a justice of the peace, formal pleadings are not required, and no question could arise as to the form of the declaration. The opinion here expressed is directly opposed to the decision in Hawkins vs. Watkins, Ark. , followed by Henry vs. Hazen, ib. . In the first case, leaving out of view any question as to the insufficiency of the declaration, for counting on the instrument in form as a bill of exchange, and omitting to aver the value of Arkansas money, the court rest their decision on the ground, that a draft payable in Arkansas money cannot be made the basis of an action against the acceptor of it. The gist of the reasoning is a re-affirmation of that in Hamilton vs. Myrick & Williamson, and Gwin vs. Roberts, where it was right, because the orders there never were accepted, and clearly the instruments were not negotiable as at the law merchant, to charge the drawer or endorser, on notice of non-performance by the drawee. In Henry vs. Hazen, the order was drawn by one Hutchinson on Hazen, requesting him to pay Henry a certain sum of money, “as soon as you receive the amount of my account with the government from Capt. Wm. Armstrong,” and Hazen accepted it on the condition that the account was not curtailed below his own account and notes, meaning, as may be supposed, what Hutchinson already owed him. The declaration contained two counts, one on the instrument and the other for money had and received. The court considered, that such an instrument, “though not valid as creating any legal liability against the parties to it, is yet competent written evidence of the acceptor’s liability under the count for money had and received, in connection with other proof to establish the happening of the contingency, upon which the acceptor was to pay:” and the judgment was reversed, because the court below refused to permit the plaintifF to adduce evidence, under the common count, of the state of accounts between Hazen and Hutchinson, in order to show' that the contingency had happened, upon which Hazen would become liable; and this was carrying out the intimation in Hawkins vs. Watkins, that the bill there sued upon could be made available in another form of action as evidence. So that, after all, the question was not so much as to the liability of the acceptor, but whether he could be sued in a particular form of action. On the other hand, in Hawkins vs. Watkins, it is said that though the acceptor would not be liable as such, upon an order payable in property, yet a note for property would be assignable, because the payee has a right'of action on the privity of contract. Now we take it that if Hawkins or Hazen, in the cases referred to, were liable at all, or in any form of action, to the payees or assignees of those drafts, it was not because of any privity of contract or consideration, passing between them, but solely by virtue of the statute of assignments, and upon the written contract of acceptance. . The innovation made upon the common law by bills of exchange, the theory of which is a transfer, by the drawer, of a sum of money which the drawee owes him, to the payee, depended solely on their negotiable character by the law merchant, and in order to make such transfer effectual to the drawee or any remote endorsee, without any new consideration or privity of contract, between the acceptor and any holder, they must have certain requisites, understood and settled by the law merchant. If A accepts B’s order in writing, to pay C, but upon remote condition, or contingency, or for property, it does not operate as a bill of exchange to transfer any right to C, to demand the money or property of A. So, since the statute of Anne, a note for property, or for money, payable upon a contingency, would not be a promissory note having any negotiable qualities, but only a parol contract in writing, which does not import a consideration, and could not be the foundation of an action. But when, by the statute, all contracts in writing for money or property import a consideration, and are the foundation of the action, and are made assignable at law as in equity, no distinction is perceived between the contract of an acceptor and the maker of a bond or note for property or payable on a contingency. In either case the liability of the maker or acceptor, does not depend upon the law merchant, and it would be singular if it did. Such instruments are not commercial paper, and no question can arise as to the liability of the drawer or endorser, on notice of nonpayment. But the maker or acceptor having bound himself by a valid contract in writing, just such right of action as the payee or obligee has on the instrument, may be transferred by the assignment to any third person, though he be an entire stranger to the original consideration. The solid objection to the policy of the whole doctrine of assignments, as regulated by statute, and an entire innovation upon the common law, is that it opens up controversies between the assignee and the obligor or promissor, respecting his equities as against the obligee and assignor, growing out of transactions to which the assignee is a stranger, and in a suit to which the assignor is not a party; and where the obligation itself is contingent or conditional, a variety of what may be termed collateral issues, are liable to spring up. Thus in Henry vs. Hazen, the court appear to have had no hesitation in allowing Henry to go into proof of complicated transactions between Hutchinson and Hazen, the drawer and acceptor of a draft payable on certain contingencies, in order to show that they had happened. As to that part of the decision there, we must conclude that if Hazen was liable on these transactions to a stranger, it was by virtue of his written contract, which the statute made assignable. It follows that the court below erred in instructing the jury, that the instrument sued on afforded sufficient evidence of indebtedness, without looking to any other testimony. The plaintiff could only recover by proving, and in a formal declaration he would have so to aver, that the defendant had received the proceeds of the crop of cotton in question to an amount sufficient to pay the draft. But for the contingency of the fund the instrument would be a regular bill of exchange, and upon the facts proven the plaintiff was clearly not entitled to recover. For this error the judgment will be reversed, and the cause remanded for farther proceedings.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862701,Gentry vs. Owen et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court. Owen and Norris executed their writing obligatory to John H. Cornish, as guardian of Virginia E. Tobin, who, by his written endorsement thereon, assigned it to Gentry, the plaintiff. The defence set up by the plea is, that before the assignment by Cornish to Gentry, Cornish had ceased to be guardian, and that Edward P. Tatum was, at the time the assignment was made, and continued to be the guardian of said minor, and as such had, at the time of the assignment of the bond to the plaintiff, and yet has the legal right of action in said bond. Upon demurrer to the plea this defence was held by the Circuit Court good, and upon exceptions to the decision of the Circuit Court, its legal sufficiency'is presented for our consideration. The authorities, cited to show that when an administrator is removed, his successor in administration (the administrator de lonis non), succeeds by operation of law to the legal rights of his predecessor in office, sustains the argument of counsel in regard to such rights as vest in the administrator, alone by operation of law; as for instance, where a note or bond is executed to his intestate and comes to the hand of the administrator as assets. The right of action would, in such case, vest in him by operation of law, in virtue of his office, and if remaining in his hands unadministered upon until displaced, would, in like manner, pass to and vest in his successor in office. But where the contract (as in this instance) is made after administration with the administrator, (although in regai-d to a subject matter properly assets in his hands), he acquires a legal right in the chose in action by contract, andnot by operation of law. For this reason ithas been held by this court, that where a note or bond is made payable to an administrator, as such, he may at his election sue upon it in either his individual or his representative right, (Hemphill vs. Hamilton, Ark. ), and in case the suit should be Commenced by the first administrator in his individual right, the action could not be revived and continued in the name of his successor, the administrator de lonis non. So that, admitting the strictest analogy to exist between the legal rights and power of administrators and guardians, as the bond in this case was executed to Cornish as guardian, he by his assignment to the plaintiff elected to treat and hold it as a debt due to him in his individual right, as fully as if he had himself sued upon it in such right. But counsel seem to have overlooked the marked difference which exists between administrators and guardians in respect to the source and extent of their respective powers and duties. It is by operation of law that administrators represent the intestate himself, succeed to his lights and,-to the extent of assets, to his-liabilities. But the guardian does not succeed to the legal rights of the ward; by virtue of his guardianship he becomes the author-' ized agent of the minor to protect his person, and to take care of and manage his property, the legal title to which is not in him but in his ward, and in whose name contracts are made, and suits touching his rights are prosecuted. Upon a change of guardians the property, the legal title in which still remains in the ward, passes to the new guardian, whose rights and duties are co-extensive with his predecessors. But as respects choses in action, executed to the guardian in consideration of the loan of money, hire of slaves, rents, &c., the-contract having been made with him, he is thereby invested with the legal-right to the chose in action, which he may well pass to another by assignment, or he may turn it over to his successor as-part of his wards’ estate, who may, at his option, accept it as such, but in that event, we apprehend that, should the new guardian sue upon such bond, unless assigned to him, suit should be-brought in the name of the first guardian, in whom the legal title; would still exist. Thus, in the case of Pond vs. Curtis, Wend. , where a covenant for the payment of rent was taken to the* guardian, whilst his ward was a minor, it was contended that suit-should have been brought in the name of the ward, he having, 'arrived at mature age before the suit was commenced, it was held that the suit v;as well brought in the name of the guardian. From the view thus taken of the case, it follows that the plea-was clearly insufficient, and that the Circuit Court erred in overruling the plaintiff’s demurrer to it. Let the judgment be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings therein,, to be had according to law.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862688,Welch et al. vs. Cole et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court. The appellants, in right of the petitioner, Ann Welch, filed their petition to the Union Probate Court against the administrators and heirs at law of Joseph Rhem, deceased, for dower in the estate of said deceased. It is alleged that the estate consists of lands, slaves, and personal estate, now in the administrator’s hands, and also a large amount of money, arising from the hire of the slaves, in all of which she claims dower. That the estate is solvent, and under the statute, she is entitled to receive, out of the goods and chattels of the estate, over and above her dower, the sum of $ , at the appraised value thereof; and prays that the administrators be made to account and that dower be assigned her. The administrators answer, to which a special replication is filed, by which issue is taken to so much of the defendant’s answer as denies the right of the petitioners to dower in the slave Cato, named in the petition, and to so much of the answer as relates to the hiring of the slaves, and the sum for which the administrators should account. The case was tried upon petition and answer. Upon the hearing of the case, the Probate Court refused to allow the widow dower in the slave Cato; and also refused to charge the administrators with such an amount of hire as petitioners thought themselves entitled to receive. From the decision and judgment of the Probate Court the petitioners appealed to the Circuit Court, where the judgment of the Probate Court was affirmed. The exceptions taken before the Probate Court present the only questions for our consideration'. They relate alone to the right to dower in the slave Cato, and in respect to the hire of the slaves. The defendants admit that Cato was one of the slaves inventoried, and held by them for a time as part of their intestate’s estate; but set up in avoidance or excuse for not accounting for the slave, that by an order of the Probate Court, he was discharged from their custody!. If such was really the case, and if the Probate Court had power to order such discharge, as this was affirmative matter, with regard to which the defendants’ answer could not be received as evidence, (See Scott, White & Co. vs. Henry & Cunningham, Ark. Rep. ,) the defendants should have introduced the record, or other competent evidence to prove that fact. As this appears not to have been done, that slave stood in the same situation that the other slaves did, and should have been taken into account in decreeing dower. The defendants did not attempt to' account for the hire of the slaves; indeed, they assume that they were, under the circumstances, not bound to account for hire. They admit that the slaves belong to the estate and were held and controlled by them, but state that the slaves were most of the time, kept upon the intestate’s farm at work, and that they accounted for the proceeds of their labor in their settlement with the court; that they were induced to pursue this course, because it had been pursued by their predecessors in administration, and because they were so requested to act by the widow, (the claimant for dower.) It was certainly the duty of the administrator to put the slaves to labor at public or private hire, whether so ordered by the Probate Court or not; or, whether hired or not, they were at all events accountable for the reasonable value of the services of the slaves. The proceeds of the labor of the slaves, whether employed on a farm or otherwise, is not the measure of the1 admin-tors’ accountability, but the ordinary value of the services of tbe slaves at hire. This Is the only safe standard of accountability easily to be arrived at by putting slaves to public hire upon notice, or by proving the rate of hire for such slaves at a given time. The proceeds of the labor of the slaves is so dependent upon the Mnd of labor to which they were put, their management, the value of produce, and like considerations, as to render it extremely difficult to arrive at any just estimate of the sum so realized, and is unwarranted by the’ nature of the trust reposed in the administrators. If (as alleged) the widow did sanction and direct the course pursued by the administrators, so far as they pursued such direction, they may be protected, as against her claim to dower, to a stricter account. But of this there is no evidence ; nor is there any evidence of the amount realized from the labor of the slaves. Reference is made in defendants’ answer to a settlement made with the court, in which they charge themselves with the sum so received, but such settlement is not made an exhibit, nor is it to be found in this record ; nor is there evidence here to be found sufficient to take an account for hire, or to assign dower except as to the slaves. The Circuit Court should have sustained the exception taken by the petitioners in the Probate Court, and have proceeded to try the case de novo. Upon such trial all the evidence which might legally have been introduced in the Probate Court upon the hearing of their cause there, would have been alike admissible upon the trial de novo in the Circuit Court, so as to enable the court upon such trial to render a final decree according to the rights of the parties upon the facts presented. The judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed and set aside, and the cause remanded to that court to be proceeded in according to law and not inconsistent with this opinion.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862675,Pike and Bertrand vs. The State and State Bank,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. The appellants exhibited their bill in the court below against the State and the Bank of the State of Arkansas, the object of which was to enjoin a judgment at law rendered against them in favor of the Bank. The questions involved may be considered as depending upon the sufficiency of the bill, the substantial allegations of which are as follows : That on the first of September, , one John Clark, as principal, .and the complainants, as his securities, executed their promissory note to the Bank of the State of Arkansas, which was discounted by the principal bank at Little Rock, for the benefit of Clark, and became due twelve months after date. That Clark departed this life, on the first day of January, , leaving the note wholly unpaid, and his estate insolvent; that Clark, at the time of his death, was a member of the State Senate, and in attendance upon the Legislature, then in session at Little Rock ; and there was due to him, from the State, a sum of money for his pay and mileage as a member of the Senate, and for his services as commissioner employed by the State in running a boundary line, more than sufficient to pay the note in question. That the State had the entire beneficial interest in the note and was really the owner and holder of it, and on the fourth of January, , the complainants, by a notice in writing, addressed to the Auditor of Public Accounts, notified the State that she would be required to appropriate the moneys so in hand belonging to the estate of Clark, to the payment of the-note, and warning the Auditor to retain a sufficiency of such moneys for that purpose; that the State disregarded the notice, and on the 9th of January in the same year, the General Assembly enacted that one Wilfred Garner be authorized to receive such moneys due from the State to Clark, and and after defraying all expenses incurred by him during that session of the Legislature, to pay over the residue,if any, to such administrator upon Clafrk’s estate, as might be thereafter appointed, and in pursuance of this act, Garner, an entire stranger to the estate, received from the Treasury the money owing from the State to Clark. That the Bank had subsequently obtained judgment against the complainants, for the amount due upon the note; the execution of which judgment they prayed might be perpetually enjoined. Upon the case made by the bill, our opinion is, that the relief sought was properly denied. The position contended for the complainants is, that as the State owned the Bank, and had full control over it, as a public corporation, the note of Clark and his securities to the Bank was really a debt due to the State, and they argue that in such case, it would be within the scope of the Auditor’s duty and authority to arrest the payment of any money, that might be due from the State to Clark, or so much of it as would be sufficient to satisfy a demand which the State had against him. It will not be necessary to decide whether the complainants would have the right to require of the Auditor to pursue this course, for their protection as Clark’s securities, upon a debt due to the State, or whether by his failure to do so, they would become released. The debt of Clark and his securities, ■the collection of which they seek to enjoin, was incurred to the Bank. It is true the State owns the Bank, but equally true, as shown by all the legislation concerning it, since the first liquidation act passed at the session of , and by the public history of the country, that the Bank is insolvent. Her assests then constitute a trust fund for the payment of her debts, and without violating the obligation of contracts entered into by the Bank, there is no mode by which that fund could be diverted, so as to deprive her creditors of the right to resort to it. This doctrine is peculiarly applicable to the State Bank, because, unless her assets became pledged as a fund for the redemption of her liabilities, it would be difficult to maintain that her issues for circulation, as contemplated by the charter, were not bills of credit, and therefore obnoxious to the federal constitution. If it be supposed to follow from the opinion of this court in the case of The State et al. vs. Curran, Eng. , that the State could be required, in preference to any creditor of the corporation, to appropriate so much of her assets, .consisting of the note of Clark and his securities, as would discharge a debt owing from the State to Clark, we do not assent to any such conclusion. Unless the State were at the same time the debtor and creditor of Clark, the act of the General Assembly referred to in the bill authorizing Garner to draw from the Treasury the moneys due to Clark, can be no cause of complaint by this proceeding. It might be argued that the act in question was a violation of the right of the creditors of Clark, which had become vested under' the general laws in force at the time of his death, to have his estate administered and distributed in due course of law, and it-might moreover be objectionable as a usurpation of power, insomuch as it contemplated that Garner, no matter how honestly exercising his discretion, should appropriate the money so received, to the payment of Clark’s debts without any judicial ascertainment of them; yet if this be so, the only consequence would be, that even if Garner, by drawing the money from the Treasury and thus intermeddling with the estate, did not render himself' liable to the creditors, as executor in his own wrong, still he was liable for all the money so drawn from the Treasury to the administrator who might be appointed upon Clark’s estate. Supposing then the complainants to be creditors of the estate of Clark, by having paid any debt of his, for which they were securities, they would have the right, in common with the other creditors, and according to the classifications fixed by law, to a distributive share of the assets, including the money drawn from the Treasury by Garner. In any view of the case, we think the decree ought to be affirmed.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862631,Saffold vs. Saffold et. al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. The original bill' in this cause was exhibited by one Lamburton and Anne, his wife, she being one of the heirs at law of John Saffold, against the other heirs at law, for an account and partition of his estate. Among the defendants to this bill were the appellant John J. Saffold, against whom an order of publication was taken as a non-resident defendant, and the appellee, James F. Saffold. Pending this suit, James F. Saffold exhibited his cross bill against the complainants and his co-defendants to the original bill, including the appellant. The cross bill .prayed for an account and partition in respect-of the subject matter of the original bill, and the .particular relief sought by it, as against the appellant, was based upon the allegation that he, by one Tapley II. Stewart, his attorney in fact, had sold and conveyed all his interest and claim as one of the heirs, in the estate of John Saffold, to certain persons, who had in turn sold and conveyed the same interest to the appellee and John F. Saffold, another of the parties to the suit. One of the objects, and so far as the appellant is concerned, the main object of the cross bill, was to divest him of his entire portion of the estate, and cause it to become vested by the decree of the court in the appellee and John F. Saffold.- An order of publication was taken upon the cross bill against the appellant, as a non-resident defendant, and he failing to appear, a decree pro confesso was entered, and upon the final hearing of both suits, a decree was rendered against him in accordance with the prayer of the cross bill. The appellant, acquiescing in the decree for partition under the original bill, has appealed from the decree upon the cross bill, affecting his rights. It will only be necessary to notice one of the matters assigned for error in the proceedings had against the appellant upon the cross bill, which is, that they were had without any sufficientor lawful notice to him of the pendency of the suit. lie contends that the notice was insufficient, because the affidavit of the non-residence, which the statute requires to be made by-the complainant, or some other person for him, in order for service of notice to be had by publication, did not state that the -appellant was a non-resident, but only that the affiant believed he was; that the order made for publication against the appellant, pro-, fessing to statejhe nature of the complaint in general terms as required by the statute, set forth that “ the object and nature of the cross bill is to obtain a discovery and account to be taken between the complainants and the defendants thereto, relative to the lands and slaves, goods, chattels, money, credits and effects which were of John Saffold, deceased, the hire, rents, issues, and profits thereof, and to obtain partition of said lands and slaves, and distribution of the personal estate of the deceased,” but was silent as to the most material object of the cross bill so far as it affected the rights of the appellant, namely, to exclude him from partition, and by virtue of the alleged conveyances to divest him of all interest in the estate to which he was an heir. And lastly, it is objected'for the appellant, that the evidence of publication, when returned and filed, purports to be verified by the affidavit of the editor instead of the “printer or publisher” of the newspaper, as provided by the statute in such case. Upon inspection of the record these objections appear to be well taken in point of fact, and adhering to the opinions in Brodie vs. Skelton, Eng. and Clark vs. Strong, Ark. , the conclusion is inevitable that they are well founded in law. The revised statutes of , required the publication of notice to non-resident defendants, of the pendency of the suit, to state fully the substance of the allegations and prayer of the bill, and this notice had to be published for eight weeks successively. By the act of , it is only necessary to state the nature of the complaint in general terms ; and the act of shortens the time of publication to two weeks in succession. We must suppose that the policy which influenced these changes in the statute, was to lessen the expense of legal proceedings and not to deprive the absent defendant of any safeguard for the due protection of his rights. It therefore affords no color of license to the courts to depart from the practice requiring that all the steps by means of which the complainant may charge a non-resident defendant upon constructive notice, be substantially complied with. The nature of the complaint upon the cross bill in this case is not sufficiently stated to comply with the spirit of the statute. So the affidavit of. the printer or publisher is required, or in lieu of that, the production of the papers containing the advertisement. The affidavit of the editor, in any given case may be true in fact, but the law, which must prescribe general rules, does not authorize the authentication by an editor, who may be and often is a person not concerned in the printing or publishing of the paper. Without passing upon any other question sought to be raised by the assignment of errors, the decree upon the cross bill, from which the appellant has appealed, will be reversed, and upon the remanding of the cause for any further proceedings, that maybe had upon this branch of it, he will be considered in court as if duly served with process, with leave to demur, plead or answer to the cross bill.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862638,Sanger et al. vs. State Bank,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. The plaintiffs in error being sued by the Bank, upon a note which they had made payable to her, interposed a plea, setting up certain matters in abatement. The plea, on motion of the plaintiff below, was stricken from the files, to which the defendants excepted, and suffered final judgment. Inasmuch as the plea, re-instated upon the record by the bill of exceptions, appears to be applicable to the action, and, for aught that appears, pleaded in apt time, good in form, signed by counsel and verified by affidavit; in short, having all the formal requisites of a plea, our opinion is, that it ought to have been demurred to, if the plaintiff below would question its legal sufficiency. This point was expressly ruled in Sillivant vs. Reardon, Ark. , followed by Wilson vs. Shannon, Eng. . In Pope vs. Tunstall, Ark. , the question of practice was waived, because the court thought the plea which had been stricken out in that case, was good in substance as well as form, and therefore felt at liberty to consider the case in the same light as if the pleadings had come up on demurrer. But the case last referred to cannot be safely followed as a precedent, because the refusal of the court in any case that might come before it, to consider the legal,sufficiency of a plea, which had been improperly stricken out on motion, would be an implied decision against its legal sufficiency; whereas, according to the established rules of pleading, the proper mode of tendering an issue in law is by demurrer; and without breaking down those rules the demurrant cannot evade it by an informal motion, so as to deprive the defendant of all benefit of any question of law upon the legal sufficiency of the plea, unless he shall get it again upon the record by bill of exceptions. True, a plea, apparently good on its face, might well be struck from the files, because frivolous or vexatious ; as for example, where the same matter is attempted to be pleaded, which the court has once adjudged insufficient, and the pleader could only rest upon the decision, or plead over. But nothing of the kind is shown here. And so, like many other legal distinctions, where the lines run into one another, it might sometimes be difficult to determine whether a party should move to strike from the files, or be put to his demurrer. But according as one or the other may be proper, the office of a demurrer cannot be subserved by a motion. At an early day, Means vs. Cromwell, Ark. , this court found it necessary to check the practice which had grown up, of interposing by informal motions, not traversable or tendering any issue of fact, matters in abatement, or which properly belonged to that class of defences. And without any particular examination of that or the several subsequent cases to the same purport, there can be no doufitthat the general tendency of them to discourage such innovations in pleading was right. Judgment reversed and cause remanded with instructions to reinstate the plea, and leave to the plaintiff to demur.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862614,"Yell, Gov. use Conant & Co. vs. Outlaw et al.","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins, delivered the opinion of the Court. Bogy and Bonne, two of the defendants here, have pleaded in bar of the w'rit of error, that at the May term, , of the Jefferson Circuit Court, at which the judgment brought up by this writ for revision, was rendered, the now plaintiff in error prayed an appeal from the same judgment, which appeal was duly prosecuted, and upon the filing of the transcript, the appeal was docketed; the appellant assigned errors, and these defendants joined therein, and such further proceedings were had, that the appeal came on to be heard and was submitted to this court for its final decision and adjudication therein. The plaintiff demurs because the plea fails to show that the appeal is still pending and undetermined, or that it has been prosecuted to final judgment in this^ court. The decision at July term, , granting the motion of the appellant in the cause referred to by the plea, for leave to dis- . miss the appeal after submission, seems to be also decisive of the question here presented. We are content to say that the right of an appellant to dismiss, at his own costs, an appeal in a common law case, and sue out a writ of error to the same judgment, does not depend upon the enquiry, whether the appeal was actually pending in.this court, or whether being so pending it had been prosecuted down to submission. We take the distinction to be between those cases where the appeal does not operate as a supersedeas, and those, on the other hand, where by operation of law or the act of the suitor, by entering into recognizance, the execution is stayed upon the granting of the appeal to this courti If the successful party in the court below, is not hindered by the appeal from having execution, no good reason is perceived why* the appellant may not dismiss his appeal, at any time before the final adjudication of it, with like effect, as if he had brought the cause here for revision by writ of error, without supersedeas. As the plea fails to show that by the original appeal, the execution of the judgment became suspended, it is not sufficient to bar the present writ of error. The pendency of the appeal at the time of suing out the writ of error, might be good in abatement of the latter proceeding, but would not be appropriately made in bar. In Clay vs. Notrebe, Eng. , this court went so far as to refuse to abate a writ of error, upon a plea that an appeal had been taken in the court below with stay of execution in the same cause. Though the decision there turned upon the issue made by the pleadings, whether the appeal had been in fact pending in this court, the judge delivering this opinion is constrained to think it was an immaterial issue; because where there has been a supersedeas, the option of the appellant to abandon his appeal and bring error, is inconsistent with the right of the appellee, under the statute, to have an affirmance of the judgment, unless the appeal is diligently prosecuted; besides, upon appeals taken in the Circuit Court, the stay of execution does not depend upon the opinion of any court or judge, who, in his discretion, may think there is probable ground of error, but the suspension is demand-able at the pleasure of the appellant, upon the sole condition of his ability to furnish satisfactory security. But waiving any such consideration it is certainly a much stronger case than the present one. Demurrer sustained.",legal_case,negative,negative,positive,error
1862642,Brackney vs. Turrentine,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins, delivered the opinion of the Court. The plaintiff in error, filed in the office of the clerk of the Hempstead Circuit Court, his account, verified by affidavit, of work and materials done and furnished in the erection of certain buildings for the defendant, in order to secure a lien on the premises under the mechanics lien law, for abalance claimed to be justly due. Subsequently, in pursuance of the statute, the plaintiff sued out a scire facias, requiring the defendant to show cause why judgment and execution should not be had against the property charged with the lien. The statute makes the scire facias equivalent to a declaration, and obviously contemplates, that the cause shall be proceeded with as other suits, which the defendant may contest; and the plaintiff may be required to prove that he is entitled to the lien, and can only have judgment for the amount which he proves is justly due him. In this case the defendant pleaded by way of set-off, that, before and at the time oí suing out the writ of scire facias, the plaintiff was and continued to be indebted to him for goods sold, work and labor, money paid, for interest, and an account stated, for a larger amount than that claimed by the writ of scire facias; and also, by way of set-off, that, before the issuance of the scire facias, there had been assigned to the defendant a certain writing obligatory, described in the plea, which the plaintiff had executed to George W. Green, the amount of which thereby became due and remained wholly unpaid with interest, from the plaintiff to the defendant. The plaintiff resting upon the overruling oí his demurrer to these pleas, the defendant had final judgment. The point which seems to be made for the plaintiff is, that the pleas should not have been to the action of the scire facias, but should have been to the account and affidavit, the effect of which might have been to defeat, in this suit, the set-off pleaded. Because the pleas, having relation to the state of the mutual indebtedness of the parties at the time the suit was instituted, if the filing of the account and affidavit is to be regarded as the institution of the suit, no after acquired demands could be available to the defendant by way of set-off. It is clear from the statute that the filing of the account and affidavit, or laying the lien, as it is called; is notthe institution of any suit, but is a preliminary step, by which the mechanic or material man may secure a lien, provided he follow it up by suit, that is, by scire facias, or bill in chancery, within a year; and then, the judgment he obtains in such suit, has relation back to the time of filing the account and affidavit. There can be no injustice to the plaintiff in holding, according to the ordinary rules of pleading, that a plea in such case is good, which sets up a cross demand, in other respects properly the subject of set-off, subsisting at the time' of the commencement of the suit, which is the issuance of the scire facias. At the same time, the remedy, as regulated by statute, is a peculiar one, and is of an equitable character. The person claiming a lien is required to file a just and true account of the work done, &c., showing the amount really due him after all just credits are given. It is for this balance that the plaintiff demands judgment in the scire facias. And it might turn out that the cross demands set up by the plea, are in whole or in part, those for which the claimant had already given credit in his account originally filed under oath. It may be, the demurrer was predicated upon the idea that for this reason, the defendant ought, in fairness, to plead to the entire claim as set forth in the account, and not to the scire facias, which only claims the balance. And in such case a question might, arise, as in Burr vs. Byers, Eng. , whether, if the plaintiff is bound to prove his whole account and failing as to part, the defendant, making no proof, can have the benefit of the credits admitted on the face of the-account. But we apprehend that any question of that kind would not. affect the legal sufficiency of the pleas. The statute gives the claimant the benefit of a lien by his complying with certain conditions, one of which is, that he shall state all just credits in his account. His act in laying the lien is ex parte, and not at all conclusive on the defendant. The intent of the statute would seem to be that, at the trial on the scire facias, the plaintiff should go into proof.of his whole account, which, though verified by'the oath of. one of the parties, does not thereby become evidence for either party. Though the plaintiff may not be entitled to recover more than the balance claimed - with interest, the enquiry is now merely one of.indebtedness as in<an ordinary suit.. If the plaintiff establishes his account and the defendant relies on payment or offset, he must prove them as any other affirmative pleas, and by the ordinary channels of evidence. If he chooses to rely on the credits given in the account, the whole account,, charges as well as credits, ought, perhaps, to be taken as one entire admission; and if the defendant relies upon a set-off, or claims credits, in addition to those given in the account, the court or jury trying the issues, must determine from the defendant’s bill of particulars and the proofs, whether they are the same items for which the plaintiff has already given credit, so that, in the language of the statute, the verdict shall be “for such sum as shall be found to be due. Upon the sufficiency of the pleas, as they stand confessed by the demurrer, the judgment of the court below is right and must be affirmed.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862630,Miller vs. Ratliff,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court! This w'as an action of assumpsit upon open account, to which the defendant pleaded non-assumpsit and set-off. The bills of particulars on either side consisted of various items, which were sought to be established by proof. No objection was made to the introduction of evidence, and the cause was submitted without instructions to the jury, who found a balance of account in favor of the plaintiff below. The defendant moved for a new trial, because the verdict was contrary to evidence, and upon the ground of newly discovered testimony. The motion being overruled, he excepted to the decision of the court and took a bill of exceptions, setting out the evidence. From this it does appear that the defendant adduced testimony conducing to prove a a larger amount of off-set than was allowed him by the verdict of the jury. But the distinction is to be taken between cases where this court will venture to set aside a verdict, because it is without evidence as to some material fact necessary to uphold it, and cases like the present, where the verdict is objected to merely because it is against evidence. The principal item of his account, which the defendant here attempted to prove, and which the jury would seem to have rejected, was for a quantity of corn, which the plaintiff had taken and sold from the plantation of the defendant. But it is inferable from the testimony, though conveyed to this court through the unsatisfactory medium of a bill of exceptions, that this was corn which the plaintiff himself, had raised upon a plantation of the defendant, and therefore, might have had a right to dispose of as his own. The presumption is to be indulged that if the verdict was grossly unjust to either party, because against the weight of evidence, the judge who presided at the trial, would not have refused to exercise his discretion to set it aside. But surely upon the verdict and the concurring refusal of the court below to disturb it, every possible presumption ought to be had in favor of its correctness. Else this court would be assuming the power it has not, to dictate to juries that they must believe evidence against their own convictions of its truth. The defendant, in his affidavit, stated that he had discovered, since the trial, that he could prove by an absent witness, the payment of a certain sum of money to the plaintiff, not long before the commencement of the suit. The witness was then residing in the county. Besides the want of diligence indicated by the tenor of the affidavit, there are various objections to its sufficiency. No such item is charged in the defendant’s bill of particulars, as that to which the newly discovered testimony would apply. If the defendant had, in fact, made such payment, it is reasonable to suppose he would charge it in his account, among other items of cash and merchandize. But the affidavit does not aver that any such payment was made except by inference, because he was informed and believed he could prove it by the witness referred to. If the defendant were indicted on this cautious affidavit for swearing falsely, that he had made such payment, it is doubtful whether he could be convicted.

1862637,"Brown vs. Collins, ad.","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. This is an application for an appeal under the provisions of our statute, (Dig. ch. , p. , and ), and the question presented, is whether or not, under the provision of the 21st section of our statute of dower; (Dig. ch. , p. ), when the husband dies, leaving a widow and no children, she takes one-half of the real estate, and one-half of the slaves of which he died seized, absolutely and in her own right, or only a dower estate in them, for the fall term of her natural life; and vve think it perfectly clear, when this section is considered in connexion with the other provisions of the dower law, that she takes only a dower interest and estate for life. It is manifest that if she takes the slaves, absolutely and in her own right, she takes the real estate in the same way, and this would be in conflict with the policy of our statute of descents, of preserving the inheritance in the blood of the first purchaser, subject to dower in the common law sense of that term; as to the duration of the estate. It is only when there are no kindred, either paternal or maternal, capable of inheriting, and next before it escheats, that real estate descends from the husband to the wife, or vice versa, (Dig. ch. , sec. ). It would be easy to show, by enlarging upon this view of the subject, that if the widow could take one-half of the land absolutely, and not a doWer -estate in it for life only, the Legislature had really achieved much less than half they evidently designed by the system of descents fthey set on foot.

This case is presented by a demurrer to a plea in abatement.The plea sets up, that on the 28th of May, , which was the-day of the rendition of the decree, the appellants prayed and obtained an appeal in this cause from the Circuit Court, and in pursuance thereof filed in this Court on the 24th of June, following, a complete transcript of the records and proceedings therein,, whereby the cause was brought into this court and remained a cause pending here until after the commencement of the present term. The appeal now pending here, which is sought to be abated by this plea, came here in pursuance of an appeal with stay of' execution, granted by one of the judges of this court during the last vacation, in pursuance of the statute, (Dig. ch. , sec. .) In the case of Taylor vs. Adams, Ark. , this court said, that under this provision of the statute, a judge in vacation might grant an appeal, notwithstanding one had been previously granted in the Circuit Court. But although this is true, it does not follow that such an appeal may not be abated like any other-suit improvidently commenced. If this appeal had been dismissed, instead of the other, which it seems from the plea had been perfected, and was pending here when this was granted, it would have been competent for this court, as held Davis vs. Tarwater, ( Ark. R. ), to have granted a stay of execution upon recognizance, although a judge in vacation could not have done so.

An interlocutory judgment was rendered against the defendants upon a recognizance conditioned that defendant, Vaughan, should appear at the Madison Circuit Court, and answer to an indictment for gaming; and separate writs of scire facias issued against them, directed to the sheriff of Madison, the county in which the defendants resided. At the return term, upon the motion of Yaughan, these writs were quashed upon the ground, that a single writ, and not separate writs, should have issued. But no further judgment appears to have been rendered. The State has brought this case before us on appeal; but there is evidently no final j udgment of the Circuit Court, from which an appeal might be taken to this court. If the State had desired to test the correctness of the-decision of the Circuit Court, she should have refused to proceed further, and suffered final judgment to bo rendered, disposing of the whole case. The question is one of practice, and we. think, properly decided by the court below, and is sustained by State Bank vs. Terry et al. Ark. .

1862725,Rowark vs. Lee,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court. James F. Lee brought his suit in replevin against John Row-ark, for a mule. The general issue was pleaded, and by consent of parties, the case was submitted to the court sitting as a jury. After having heard the evidence the court found for the plaintiff, and as the property had not been replevied and delivered to the plaintiff, the court also heard evidence, as well touching the damages for the detention of the property as the value thereof, and rendered a judgment in his favor for the same. Whereupon, the defendant moved the court to grant him a new trial, because the finding of the court was contrary to law and evidence; which motion the court overruled. The defendant excepted and made the evidence matter of record by his bill of exceptions. The questions presented and argued by counsel are, first, as to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the finding of the court; and second, that it was error in the court to render an absolute judgment for the value of the property. As regards the first question, there can be no doubt but that the evidence is sufficient to uphold the finding of the court. There is no lack of evidence upon any point necessary to a recovery; and although the evidence of several of the witnesses is somewhat contradictory, as well with regard to the purchase of the mule by the plaintiff, as the identity of the mule in the defendant’s possession, as the same purchased by the plaintiff, it was the peculiar province of the court sitting as a jury to weigh the evidence and determine the facts, and having done so, we do not feel at liberty to disturb the verdict. After finding the issue for the plaintiff, the court, under the circumstances of the case, properly ascertained the value of the mule, but failed to render a judgment thereon, in accordance with the statute. Section , ch. 13G Dig., provides “that in case the plaintiff shall recover judgment upon the whole record, he shall be entitled, in addition to judgment for damages and costs, to a further judgment, that the property be replevied and delivered to him without delay; or in default thereof, that the plaintiff recover from the defendant the value of the property ascertained by the court or jury. Under the provisions of the statute, the court should have rendered judgment that the property be replevied and delivered; as well as for the value thereof. Under the provisions of the statute judgment, when properly rendered, the defendant may surrender the property and discharge himself from the payment of the damages: but by the judgment, as rendered in this case, he is deprived of the privilege of doing so. For this error the judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions to the court below to render judgment on the verdict and finding of the court in accordance with this opinion.",legal_case,positive,negative,neutral,positive
1862623,Scott vs. Fowler et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker, delivered the opinion of the Court. When this case was, upon a former occasion-, before us (see Eng. Rep. ), the 4th plea of defendant, Fowler, the legal effect of which was to deny the existence of a subsisting cause of action in the plaintiff at the time his suit was commenced, was held to be a good plea in bar; and consequently no question can now be raised as to its legal sufficiency. When the case was remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings therein to be had, the plaintiff replied to the 4th plea, matter which showed that his right to sue accrued to him at a day subsequent to the commencement of his action. And the legal sufficiency of this replication is the sole question now' to be decided. If the plaintiff had, by a general replication, traversed the defence setup in the plea, the material fact thus putin issue would have been the pendency of the appeal at the time the suit was commenced. Instead of doing this, he filed a special replication, by which the existence of the appeal at the time stated in the defendant’s plea was admitted, and the subsequent disposal of the case in the Supreme Court was set up in avoidance of the matter pleaded by the defendant. This new matter was clearly insufficient for that purpose. The question raised by the plea was, as to the existence of the plaintiff’s right of action at the time the suit was commenced, and not as to whether it had subsequently accrued. So that unless the subsequently acquired right was, in legal effect, equivalent to a pre-existing right, it was not responsive to the plea; for it is a well established rule that no one can sue in a court of law, wffio has not, at the time of bringing his-suit, a then existing- right of action in himself. The right of action in the plaintiff in this case accrued from and at the date of the final decision of the Supreme Court, affirming the decree of the Circuit Court, and whether the pre-existing disabilty to sue should be considered as matter in bar or abatement, although the judgments upon these pleas are, in several respects, different; that in bar being conclusive upon the parties, upon all pre-existing matters at issue; that in abatement, where a temporary disability is pleaded, that the plant remain without day, &c. In this case the defence was that the right of action at the time the suit w'as brought, had not accrued. The judgment, then, upon the plea in bar, although conclusive upon their existing rights, could not be pleaded in bar of a subsequently acquired right of a„ction. So that, so far as the rights of the parties are concerned, it would be as-harmless as the judgment upon a plea in abatement would. Suppose suit had been brought upon the injunction bond before the decree in the Circuit Court. It is very clear, according to the decision of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, that no action could be maintained upon the bond, and as was the case there, that this matter could be pleaded in bar. Cates &c., vs. Wooldridge, J. J. Marsh. Rep. . In that case, as in this, suit was brought upon an injunction bond and a plea in bar interposed. In reference to this defence, the court said, “ If the demurrer could be considered as applicable to the plea, denying the dissolution of the injunction, as alleged in the declaration, we should not hesitate to reverse the decision of the court below, in sustaining the demurrer, for the plea is unquestionably good. No cause of action could accrue on the injunction bond until the injunction was discharged or dissolved.” But although no action could be maintained, and although it was also held that a plea in bar was properly interposed, no one vvould contend that the judgment rendered upon such plea, however conclusive upon any then existing cause of action, could be plead in bar to a suit upon a subsequently accruing right of action, or, as in the cáse of Barry vs. Long, Ala. Rep. , if suit should be brought upon a contract before it fell due, it could never be, that judgment upon the issue formed could be pleaded in bar of a recovery on such contract after it had matured. The case of Barry vs. Long, was assumpsit, where the general issue had been pleaded. The court, in that case, held that the fact that the contract upon which, the suit was brought had not matured, need not be pleaded in abatement, but might be given in evidence under the general issue. So that, in any point of view in which this case presents itself, it is a matter of form, rather than substance, whether the matter of defence be pleaded in bar or abatement; and the replication of the plaintiff would have fallen as far short of a sufficient response to the plea in the one case as in the other. In conclusion, we will remark that we have been led by the argument of the plaintiff’s counsel, into a fuller investigation of the manner of reaching defects of this kind, and of the judgment to be rendered on the issues, whether in bar or abatement, than the precise point at issue might seem to require. The replication was clearly insufficient. Judgment affirmed. Watkins, C J., not sitting.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,negative
1862619,Brock vs. Smith,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. The appellant, Brock, who was the plaintiff below, sued the defendant in trespass for breaking and entering his close, and taking therefrom a quantity of cord-wood; to which the defendant pleaded not guilty. The facts proven, as shown by the bill of exceptions, were, that in the year , the defendant cut fifly cords of wood on the land mentioned in the declaration, while the same was public land belonging to the United States. In the month of June, , the plaintiff entered, or purchased the land in question from the United States, and it became his private property; but the only evidence, introduced by the plaintiff to show title in himself, was the certificate of the Register of the land office, that he had entered and located the same by virtue of a Choctaw certificate, and also the Receiver’s reeeipt for the amount of money paid in by the plaintiff for the purchase of the excess of land over and above the number of acres called for by the Choctaw certificate. To the’introduction of which evidence, it being at the same time admi'ted that the plaintiff never had been in possession of the land, the defendant objected, upon the ground that trespass could not be maintained. It further appeared that, at the time the plaintiff purchased the land, the cord-wood referred to was •still upon it, not having been removed, and shortly afterwards he gave the defendant notice that the land was his, and not to to remove the wood from it. Notwithstanding such notification the defendant went upon the land, carried off the cord-wood and sold it. Wood standing in the tree was worth ten cents per cord, but when cut into cord-wood and after being hauled to the river, was worth one dollar and fifty cents per cord. Each party asked for instructions : the plaintiff insisting that, upon the facts stated he was entitled to maintain the action, and recover of the defendant under the statute, three times the value of the wood carried off: and it was insisted on behalf of the defendant, that if he was liable it was only for the value of the timber in the tree, and not for its increased value after it was cut into cord-wood. The court charged the jury, that if Smith cut the wood upon Government land, and after the wood was cut, and before the same was removed, Brock purchased the land from the Government, the right of the wood was in Smith, and he was not guilty of a trespass in taking it off. The jury being so instructed found for the defendant. It is argued for the plaintiff that the opinion in Floyd vs. Ricks, decided at July term, , determines all the questions presented on this record. And it is argued for the defendant that by virtue of the pre-emption laws and the general policy of the land system^of the United States, recognized by our statutes, he had an implied license to cut timber on the vacant public lands, and that in consequence of his labor bestowed, the wood became his by right of accession. The legislation of this State, making improvements on the public lands assets in the hands of the administrator, Digest p. , sec. , authorizing ejectment to be maintained for them, with or without a right of pre-emption, ib. p. , sec. , subjecting them to execution, where the defendant is not residing on, or cultivating the same, ib. p , sec. , is all subordinate to the primary right of soil and disposition remaining in the Federal Government, and does not profess to interfere with it. And this is fully admitted by the decisions upon this subject, as affected by those statutes. Pelham vs. Wilson, Ark. . Hughes vs. Sloan, Eng. . Pelham vs. Floyd, ib. . McFarland vs. Matthis, ib. . The case of Wilcox vs. Jackson, Peters, is a controlling authority, to the effect, that the States have no power to interfere with the unqualified right of the United States, to dispose of the public domain. It does not appear that the defendant had any settlement or improvement upon the land in question, which would give him any claim as a pre-e'mptor. If he had any such claim, it was lost by his own fault or neglect in failing to comply with the terms prescribed by the acts of Congress. The fact that the United States made a valid sale of the land to the plaintiff, implies that the defendant had no rights in the premises: and as held in Floyd vs. Ricks, he must be. regarded as a trespasser. Being such, he acquired no title to the wood by accession, Kent ; nor was such a change wrought in the character of the timber by the act of the defendant, in splitting it up into cord-wood, as to make it his by conversion. Betts vs. Lee, John. . The wood therefore continued to belong to the owner of the land from which it had been severed. In Floyd vs. Ricks, the facts, so far as material to the present case, were that Ricks had an improvement on public land and a crop growing upon it. While the crop was growing and before it was gathered, Floyd purchased the land from the United States. He entered upon the land, and gathered a portion of the crop, and for thus taking it away, Ricks sued him in trespass. For aught that appeared, Ricks occupied the position of a mere intruder on the land of another person, and his improvements, made there without license, became attached to the freehold, and belonged to the owner of the soil. And even if he had an implied license under the pre-emption laws, he forfeited all right to the gratuity by neglecting to comply with the terms on which be might have obtained it. The case therefore had to be determined upon general piinciples affecting all ordinary transfers of land. And though growing crops are for some purposes regarded as personalty, being subject to execution against a tenant, and the sale of them as personalty, contemplating an after severance, need not be in writing within the statute of frauds, yet they do so far partake of the nature of realty, that as between vendor and vendee, the sale of the land passes the growing crop along with it, unless there be an express reservation. Though there may be some conflict in the cases, that such is the law is fully established by the weight of authority. And it followed that the purchaser of the land, having become owner of the crop growing upon it, so far from being liable as a trespasser for gathering the crop, if the position of the parties on the record had been reversed, Floyd could have maintained the action against Ricks for carrying off any portion of it. But in this case when the trees were severed, though the ownership of them was not changed, they became personalty. Crabbe Law of Real Prop. , citing Bewick vs. Whitfield, P. Wms. , and Channon vs. Patch. Barn. & Cress. , in which latter case the contest between landlord and tenant, respecting certain trees which had been felled, turned upon the difference between timber and pollards. See also Hilliard Ab. . And in Mooers vs. Wait, Wend. , there was, from the facts appearing in the report, a severe application of the principle stated by the court, that “when trees or anything else attached to the freehold, are unlawfully detached therefrom, the property thus wrongfully separated from the freehold becomes the persona] property of the owner of the inheritance.” Some extreme cases are to be found of chattels passing to the vendee under the head of fixtures; such as manure in heaps, which has been col lected upon the land for agricultural purposes; so. a fencing, though the rails have been torn down ; and detached parts of machinery, occasionally used in connection with it. But there is no intimation here that the wood in question was ever designed to be converted into a fixture, or was in any way adapted for agricultural purposes. There is no authority for holding, that chattels not attached to the freehold, and not partaking oí the nature of realty, pass by a sale of the land to the vendee. The owner of the land at the time of the severance, being the-owner of the cord-wood, might have maintained trespass or tro-, ver against Smith, for taking it away or converting it to his own, use. The only remaining enquiry is, whether this plaintiff had any special property in it, which would enable him to maintain this action. At the common law he could not have brought trespass, because he had not possession of the land. The first relaxation of this rule, and which was necessary to protect the owners of vacant land, or wild lands, allowed trespass to be maintained upon a constructive possession, where the plaintiff had title. Ledbetter vs. Fitzgerald, Ark. , ever since followed in this State, though as a consequence it becomes an indirect mode of litigating the title to land. Then as great quantities of land were held under equitable titles, derived from the government, not perfected into grants by unavoidable delay in, the emanation of patents, the statute authorized actions of ejectment and trespass to realty to be maintained upon the evidence of a receipt or certificate of purchase, issued by a land officer of the United States, See Floyd vs. Ricks. There can be no good reason for holding that the plaintiff’s constructive possession of the land, based upon an equitable title, gave him any possession of the wood, which had been cut and lying upon it. The owner of the wood had a constructive possession of it; bat. it is admitted that the plaintiff had no actual possession, which would be necessary to support the action against a mere stranger or wrongdoer. The bailee of a chattel, who has a special property in it by the express or implied license of the owner, may maintain an action in respect of any injury done to it, and may protect his possession as against a wrong-doer, because, he is presumed to hold possession for the owner, and is in some way accountable to him. The vendor of land would have a reasonable-privilege of entry to remove a chattel of his, that might be upon* it at the time of sale accompanied with actual possession, but no presumption arises from the mere act of sale, that the vendee, who never had possession of the land, would become bailee or agent for the owner of a chattel so situated, or in any manner-bound to protect it from injury or waste done by a stranger.. The plaintiff is not entitled tio recover the value of the wood in damages. But upon the facts stated, he would be entitled to nominal damages for the wrongful and unauthorized act of the defendant in entering upon the land for the purpose of carrying off the wood, to which he had no claim. Upon this ground the judgment will have to be reversed and the cause remanded for-proceedings in accordance with the opinion here expressed.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862620,Gracie vs. Robinson,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. The defendant gave to the plaintiff a receipt in the following words: “ This is to certify that I hold in my possession beef steei’, belonging to Mr. Pierce B. Gracie, that he bought of Bill. Hodge and one cow and calf, this Oct. 11th, . N. E. ROBINSON.” The account filed before the justice of the peace on the 27th of June, , upon which this suit was instituted, is as follows : “Newton E. Robinson, To Pierce B. Gracie, Dr. . Oct. , To head of beef cattle, $ “ “ “ one cow and calf, $ The defendant had judgment on the trial before the justice from which the plaintiff appealed, and the cause being tried de novo in the Circuit Court, the defendant again had judgment in his favor. It appears from the plaintiff’s bill of exceptions, taken to the overruling of his motion for new tidal, that the plaintifi’introduced a witness, who testified that in December, , he on behalf of the plaintiff demanded of the defendant the cattle in question, who did not deliver the same or any part of them. He also proved by another witness the value of beef cattle and of a cow and calf, in October , and in December . This was the entire case made for the plaintiff. * This gist of the complaint was for a conversion of the cattle by the defendant. Waiving any enquiry whether the evidence stated be sufficient to establish a conversion; and conceding that, waiving any question whether, inasmuch as it did not appear that the defendant had sold, or in any manner received the proceeds of the cattle, so as to make him chargeable fbr money on account, the proper remedy of the plaintiff was not by action of trover, the jurisdiction of which appropriately belonged to the Circuit Court — the evidence for the defendant, drawn out on cross-examination of the plaintiff’s witnesses concerning what passed between him and the defendant at the time of the demand, conduced to establish the following facts: That the cattle according to the custom of the country, were running in the range in the low lands of the Ouachita river, near which the defendant lived, and it was not designed that they should be kept up in any enclosure. That the defendant took charge of the cattle for the accommodation of the plaintiff, and as a mere friendly act to secure them ■to him, so that Hod:;e could not dispose of them; that after defendant gave the receipt, there came an overflow of the Ouachita •river, which drowned and washed off a great many cattle, and the defendant lost some of his own cattle in the overflow at that time: that there was°one of the beef cattle then in the range, and which he offered to go with the witness and hunt up if he would wait, but defendant did not offer to hunt up or deliver any of the ■other cattle. Both of the witnesses testified, of their own knowledge, to the fact of the overflow, and the destruction of cattle caused by it, and that many drowned carcasses were found near where the ■ defendant lived : so that it is fair to presume that both verdicts were in accordance with the substantial justice of the case, and ■ought not to be disturbed. But the objection was taken and reserved by the plaintiff, to ■the proof of any statements or declarations made by the defendant at the time of the demand, and all of which after their introduction he again moved to exclude. Certainly there was some •o/ the conversation between the defendant and the witness, consisting of neighborhood chat, not necessary to be detailed, that was irrelevant. The plaintiff insists that the defendant could not, for any purpose, make evidence for himself by proof of his own •declarations, and the defendant claims the benefit of all that was done and said between him and the witness at the time of the •demand. In actions on the case against a bailee for negligence, the bur-then of the proof of negligence is upon the plaintiff, and if the defendant gets the benefit of his own declaration it is under the rule, that if a plaintiff calls for a part, the defendant is entitled to have the whole of any one conversation. Bat whenever as is usually the case in trover, it is necessary to prove a previous demand and refusal, in order to fix the liability of the defendant, the burthen of proof devolves on him to account satisfactorily for the property if lost or he have it not ready to surrender. We apprehend that in such cases, and wherever a demand is necessary, all that passed at the time relative to the matter and what the defendant said by way of excuse, being part of the res gestae attending the demand, is evidence for as well as against him, and is admissible on cross-examination, through the jury, or court sitting as one, might well believe part and reject part, according to their judgment of its credibility, or according as any portion of the defendant’s statement might be inconsistent with other evidence in the cause. Where a bailee, called upon to produce the chattel, undertakes to account for its loss or destruction, the admissibility of his statement by way of excuse, would depend upon the character of the bailment and the nature of his liability. No such statement of his would be admissible, unless it would also be competent by way of excuse, if proved aliunde. Without undertaking to distinguish between negligence and gross negligence, where tne bailment is without reward and for the accommodation of the bailor, the statements of the bailee, excusing.his failure or qualifying his refusal to surrender the chattel, where the object of the demand is to charge him with a tortious conversion, though by no means conclusive, are yet admissible in his favor, by reason of the trust and confidence implied in this species of contract. So the acts and declarations of a gratuitous bailee, cotemporaneous with the loss of the thing bailed, are always competent to exhonorate him from the imputation of fraud. In this case the defendant had the right to draw out on cross-examination of the witness proving the demand, what was said in response to it; the general objection made in advance to any evidence of the kind was not well taken, and as some portion of it was admissible, the motion to exclude the whole was without discrimination was properly overruled.

1862629,Adkins vs. Hershy,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. The suit was here originally commenced by the appellee against the appellant, to recover a balance due on an open acccount, filed before the justice, as the foundation of the complaint. The defendant had judgment in the justice’s court, and the plaintiff, Hershy, appealed to the Circuit Court. Upon tiial anew in that court, the only evidence adduced by the plaintiff to prove his account against the defendant, was the testimony of a witness, who stated that he had presented the account to the defendant. The account referred to contained sundry charges and credits,, showing a small balance to be due the plaintiff. The •defendant said the account was correct, and at the same time •stated that the credits for corn, thereon entered, were not correct, and that the defendant was entitled to a credit of bushels in lieu of the first credit of bushels; also that he was entitled to cents per bushel instead of £ cents, as credited for another item of bushels therein contained, and the defendant, after malting a calculation of the debits and credits in the account referred to, stated to the witness that the plaintiff was justly indebted to him in a trifling amount. The court, against the objection of the defendant, charged the jury in substance, that when a defendant files a set-off, he is bound to prove it in the same manner that a plaintiff must prove his account, on which he brings suit; and that if an account is presented to an individual, his admissions of its correctness are good evidence against him to prove the account, but that the party’s statements, made in the same conversation and at the same time alleging that the other party was indebted to him above what he owed, or any other statements, made in his own favor at the same time, cannot be introduced as evidence to prove his set-off. The effect of this instruction was, to exclude from the jury all the defendant had said to the witness during the same conversation beyond his admissions, that the items charged on the debit side of the account were correct. * The defendant had filed an account on cross demand, by way of set-off, and ordinarily, it would be true that in such case, he must prove his set-off as affirmative matter, in the same manner that the plaintiff is required to prove his account. In that position each party becomes plaintiff, but is under no obligation to make his adversary a witness, either by calling him to the stand, or relying uyon his statements out of court. But if the plaintiff chooses oris obliged, for the want of other evidence, to resort to the admissions of the defendant, there, is no rule of law better settled, or more consonant with justice, than the one that the party who is sought to be charged by an admission, is entitled to the benefit of all that he said by way of qualification or explanation, during- the same conversation, relative to the business in hand. The admission must be taken as a whole, and if the plaintiff proves only a part, the defendant may call for the entire conversation on cross-examination. The rule is, not that the plain-, tiff is concluded by the entire admission, but that it is competent evidence for the defendant to go to the jury, who are the proper judges of its credibility, and may reject such portions if any, as appear to be inconsistent, improbable or rebutted by other circumstances in evidence. So the-plaintiff, who gives the proper credits upon his account, as every correct business man should endeavor to do, has the benefit of the same rule. .He can only recover such amount as he proves, and the defendant is put upon proof of his payment or set-off in avoidance; yet if he claim the benefit of any credit on the face of the account, it becomes an admission of the correctness of the entire debit side of the account. But the defendant would be no more precluded by such admission, from proving that he was entitled to other and further credits, orto a greater amount than those given in the account rendered, than the plaintiff would be for from going into proof of any item which the defendant had refused to admit. There was some other conflicting testimony about, the market price claimed by the defendant for the corn the plaintiff had of him. That was a question of fact for the jury,'not touched by this opinion. But clearly, the appellant was aggrieved b.y the erroneous instruction to the jury; end in reversing the judgment we must say it is to be regretted that a case like the present should have found its way into the court of last resort.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862696,Butts use &c. vs. Grayson,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins, delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an action of debt upon a judgment. The plaintiff sued for the use of Frederick H. Cossitt, James M. Howard and Jno. H. Hill, partners, &c., under the firm of “ Cossitt, Howard & Hill,” thé amount of debt demanded being $ . The writ of summons, which issued upon the filing of the declaration, contained corresponding recitals. At the return term, the defendant appeared and demurred to the declaration. The demurrer being sustained, the plaintiff obtained leave to file an amended declaration, at the succeeding term, to which the cause was continued. By his amended declaration, the plaintiff professed to sue for the use of the same persons composing the firm of “Cossitt, Howard & Hill,” except that the name of the latter was stated as Ira H. Hill, and the aggregate debt demanded was $ ■. For these supposed variances between the writ and the amended declaration, the defendant was allowed to file a plea in abatement of the writ. The plaintiff excepted to a decision of the court overruling his motion-to strike out the plea, and he resting upon this exception, the defendant had judgment. In any view of the case, the plea ought to have been treated .as frivolous. The defendant being in court upon his demurrer, the writ of summons to bring him there had fulfilled its office. A variance between the writ and cause of action set forth in the declaration, to which he had appeared, was no longer available as a defence. Odle vs. Floyd & Erwin, Ark. . For aught that appears the amendments were proper to be allowed in the discretion of the court for the furtherance of justice, of clerical misprisions in the first declaration, and not operating to the surprise or injury of the defendant, who acquiesced in them. The amended declaration set out the same cause of action as the former one, varying only as to an item of costs adjudged in the original suit. There being a plaintiff on the record, having the legal title and right to sue, he was under no obligation to disclose the name of the person for whose use the suit might have been brought. That was a precaution for the benefit of the cestui que trust, or equitable assignee of the claim, whose rights will be protected by courts of law against any fraudulent combination between the nominal plaintiff and the defendant. So, notwithstanding any misdescription of the equitable assignee, the defendant might well have pleaded and proved a payment to, or release by the real owner of the demand sued for; so that no substantial right of his could be impaired by any such mistake or omission in the declaration. The cause will be remanded with instructions to sustain the motion to strike out the plea in abatement, and that the defendant be heard, oí he have any defence to the merits.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862704,"Crittenden vs. Johnson, et al.","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1851-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott, delivered the opinion of the court. This case was here at the January term, , when it was heard, and remanded for further proceedings, according to the principles of equity, and not inconsistent with the opinion therein delivered, the decision of the Circuit Court having been reversed. It appeared from the transcript, that at the hearing in the Circuit Court, in June, A.D., , it was agreed of record by the respective parties, that the bill and answer in the cause were to1 be taken as true without any other or further proof to substantiate them, so far as they related to the right of the complainant to dower in the premises' in question; a portion of the answer having been previously stricken out. From the bill, and what, remained of the answer and the accompanying exhibits of both, it appeared that, on the 2d day of February, , the petitioner was and had been long theretofore the lawful w;fe of Robert Crittenden, since then deceased, residing with him on the lands and tenements in question. That on that day, the said Robert was the legal owner in fee simple, and was seized and possessed of the said lands and tenements, and being so seized and possessed, he conveyed them, by deed in trust, without warranty, in which the petitioner did not join, to Cummins and Fowler, trustees, upon certain conditions expressed, for the benefit of Morris. That the said Robert, having departed this life on the 18th of December, A. D. , the lands and tenements in question were gold by the trustees, on the second Monday in January, , in accordance with the provisions of the deed in trust, to the said Morris, “in fee simple,” as is alleged in the answer. That on the 22d of that month, Morris sold, assigned, and transferred to the respondent, Benjamin Johnson, all his right, title and interest in and to the same, and requested the trustees to convey the premises to the said respondent and his heirs. That in pursuance of that request the trustees did, on the 27th of February, , by their deed of that date, convey the same to the “respondent and ■his heirs forever,” and that from the last mentioned day the respondent had been, and was still in possession of the lands and tenements in question, “as the owner and proprietor thereof in fee simple.” It also appeared that Crittenden died intestate and wholly insolvent, and that the petitioner tarried in the premises, rent free, for a portion of the term of two years after the death of her husband, and received from the respondent the sum of two hundred dollars, as rent for the unexpired residue of said term of two years, and also received from the administrators household goods and other chattels, of the appraised value of one hundred and fifty dollars. The other facts that appeared need not be stated, as they related to questions that would arise in case only the main question should be found for the petitioner. Upon this state of facts this court decided, as questions of law raised by facts as they then appeared, that the widow’s right of dower in the estate left by her husband, by the territorial statute {in force from the year ), was subordinate to the rights of creditors. That when the estate was insolvent, the specific articles and other personal property, to the amount of $ at the appraised value, were in commutation and satisfaction of the dower rights in the personalty. That the two years tarrying in the mansion house and the plantations thereunto belonging, of which the husband died seized and possessed, all rent free, was in commutation and satisfaction of all dower rights in the lands and tenements or real estate of which her husband died seized and possessed. That the widow was entitled to dower in lands aliened by her husband in his life time, in which she did not join, although his estate should be insolvent. And that a conveyance by the husband, by deed in trust to trustees, for the security and payment of a debt, was not a mere mortgage incumbrance upon the land «conveyed, but an alienation of it. It will be seen from the foregoing facts that although it did appear the deed in trust was without a covenant of warranty, it did not appear in any way, that the only valid title, under which all the parties claim, was an after acquired one. On the contrary, it expressly appeared on the part of the petitioner, that Robert Crittenden was the “legal owner in fee simple, and was seized and possessed” of the premises in question, and conveyed them to the trustees. And on the part of the respondent, (who made his only claim of title 'from Crittenden through this deed in trust) that by the several deeds mentioned, the lands and tenements in question were from Crittenden conveyed to him and his heirs forever. And that from the date of the last of these deeds, he had been and was still in the possesion of the premises, “as the owner and proprietor thereof in fee simple.” And this, as we shall presently see, was in legal contemplation totally inconsistent with the existence of any after acquired title as that which the parties respectively had-alleged and admitted of record to have been conveyed and received. Hence the decision of this court upon the points of law above' mentioned, as having arisen in the progress of this case, not only had no reference to any after .acquired title, but was predicated upon a state of facts which excluded the idea altogether. After the cause had been returned into the Circuit Court, new parties were there substituted in the stead of the respondent, who had in the meantime departed this life, and it was again heard there upon the bill, answer, replication and exhibits, and upon an agreed statement of facts signed by counsel and made a part of the record in the cause, the only change in the pleadings consisting of the re-instatement of so much of the answer as had been before stricken out, and this by consent. That agreement proceeds as follows to wit: “By consent of the parties aforesaid, the following facts are agreed upon, and ordered to be made of record in this cause, namely, ‘that on and prior to the 2d day of February, A.D., , the said complainant was the lawful wife of the said Robert Crittenden.’ ” "" That on the 22d day of November, , William Russell,. Henry W. Conway, Robert Crittenden, William Trimble, Robert C. Oden, Thomas P. Eskridge, and Joseph Hardin, who claimed to be and were recognized as original proprietors of the town of Little Rock, in said county, by their deed of that date, conveyed and quit claimed, without warranty, to Chester Ashley, blocks No. and , as designated upon the plat of said town, now city of Little Rock. That on the 11th day of July, , said Chester Ashley and Mary W. W., his wife, by their deed of that date, with covenants of warranty, conveyed the said two blocks to the "" said Robert Crittenden, and excepting one lot on the north-west corner of said block , which he had sold to one Elias Rector. Said Robert Crittenden died in the actual possession of said two blocks. “ That on the 2d day of February, , said Robert Crittenden, together with John Morris and Absalom Fowler, and William Cummins, executed the deed of trust, a copy of which is on file in this cause, as exhibit “A,” to the complainants bill, and so-referred to and made a part hereof. ■ “ That on the 18th day of December, , the said Robert Crittenden departed this life intestate and insolvent, not having sufficient real or personal estate wherewith to pay the privileged debts allowed against his estate, leaving all other debts not privileged wholly unpaid, and that said complainant, as his widow received, on the 13th day of April, A.D., , from Absalom Fowler and Ben. Desha, as his administrators, $ worth of household furniture, and personal property of his estate, selected by her at their appraised value, and also tarried in the mansion-house, and messuage of said intestate, being the premises aforesaid, for a portion of the term of two years after his decease, and for the residue of said term sold her right so to tarry therein to the said Benjamin Johnson, for the consideration paid to- her by him, as set forth in his answer. “ That on the second Monday in January, A.D.,--, the said Absalom Fowler and William Cummins as trustees underand by virtue of said deed, referred to as exhibit “A,” sold said premises to the said John Morris, the father of the complainant, an d ■that said Morris, on the 22d day of January, A.D., , by his deed of that date, sold and assigned his rights under and by virtue of said deed of trust and his purchase aforesaid, to the said Benjamin Johnson, and requested the said trustees to convey said premises pursuant to such sale, to the said Benjamin Johnson, a copy of which deed of sale and assignment is on file in this cause, as exhibit B, to the complainant’s bill, and so referred to and made a part hereof. “That on the 27th day of February, A.D. , said Absalom Fowler and William Cummins, as such trustees, by their deed of that date, conveyed said premises, to the said Benjamin Johnson, a copy of which deed is on file in this cause, as exhibit “C” to the answer of said defendant, and so made a part hereof. “That said Benjamin Johnson, by virtue of said last mentioned deed, and of his purchase subsequent thereto from said complainant of the residue of her unexpired term of two years, or right to tarry in said mansion house and premises, became possessed of the same, and he thenceforward, until his death, and the said defendants since have ever continued to be in possession thereof. “That said blocks and are embraced within the west fractional part (west of the Quapaw line), of the south-west fractional quarter of fractional section two, (south of Arkansas river), in township one north, of range twelve west. “That said fraction of land, containing - acres, was entered and purchased by Roswell Beebe, from the United States at the District Land Office, at Little Rock, on the 6th day of June, A.D. , and a patent certificate then issued to him therefor, upon which a patent issued from the United States, bearing date the 25th day of September, A.D. , granting to said Beebe the said tract or fraction of land, a copy of which patent is herewith filed, marked “D,” and so referred to and made a part hereof. “That such entry and purchase were made for the joint benefit of said Beebe and Ashley, and by agreement or understanding between them, said Beebe was to assure or make good the titles to all lots in the city of Little""Rock, which had been previously sold or conveyed and warranted by said Ashley. “That on the 6th day of July, A.D. , said Roswell Beebe-executed to the mayor and aldermen of Little Rock, his covenant of that date, a copy of which is herewith filed, marked “E,” and so referred to and made a part hereof. “That on the 1st day of January, A.D. , Roswell Beebe and Clarissa his wife, by their deed of that date, referring to said covenant, to the Mayor and Aldermen, and pursuant thereto, released and forever quit claimed to the said Chester Ashley, said blocks and . “And upon the foregoing facts, so stated and agreed upon, it is subrtiitted to the court here to decide whether said complainant is ¡entitled to dower in said two blocks and premises (excepting the single lot aforesaid), and if so, from what period of time she is so Antitied, and in case the court should decree that said complainant is so entitled, that then it is agreed, that it shall be referred to the master in chancery, to enquire and ascertain the value of the yearly rents and profits of said premises, and the amount and value of the taxes and assessments thereon, and of repairs which were required to preserve them from decay by tim e, and wear and tear from use and occupation, and which were necessary for the comfortable use and enjoyment of the same, by the said Benjamin Johnson, and the present defendants since his decease, and take and state an account thereof, from such time as the court here shall decide her to be so entitled, to the time of taking such account, and make report thereof to this court. That portion of the answer, which was thus by agreement reinstated, was as follows, to wit; “But this respondent in no way admits that said Chester and wife, or the. said Robert, or any, or either of them were seized or possessed, during the lifetime of the said Robert, of any legal or equitable right, title or estate in or to said blocks of lots, or any part of either, but on the contrary thereof, he is informed and so expressly, denies that they or either of them were so seized or possessed. And for other and further answer to the said petition, this respondent avers that the said Robert Crittenden never had, at any time during his life, nor did any person or persons, by, from, or under whom he claimed title in or to the said two blocks of lots, have at any time during his life any legal or equitable right or title in or to.the same or any part thereof. But on the contrary, the title in and to the same, remained in the government of the United States, nor did the said government part with her legal or eqrfitable right or title in or to said blocks or parcels of land, until after the death of the said Robert, and that the said Robert, who died, in-the actual use, occupation or possession of said two blocks of land and premises, and claiming to be the owner thereof, and of the equity of redemption therein, subject to his deed of trust aforesaid, was not, at any time during his life, seized or possessed, nor did he die seized or possessed of any legal or equitable estate in or to the same or any part thereof, whereunto the pretended right of downer of the said petitioner could attach.” Upon this state of the case, as it is now before us, a question is made by counsel, as to whether or not the cause up res nova. It seeming to be supposed, upon the one side, that if it does not, the pleadings are so narrow that there is no place for the consideration of many of the facts that have been agreed upon and submitted to the judgment of the court, and consequently they must be disregarded, as evidence would be that was irrelevant to any given allegation, and such of them only considered as would support the denial of Robert Crittenden’s seizin; there being, as contended, no allegations in the pleadings to let in proof to rebut that denial. While on the other hand, it is insisted that all other questions, except as to Robert Crittenden’s title, were closed when the case was in this court before, and that the facts agreed upon were so stated and agreed solely with a view to the determination of this only remaining question, and that if the pleadings are not broad enough to admit such of the facts as support Robert Crittenden’s title, to that extent only the pleadings ought to be considered as enlarged by force of the agreement, but not to the extent of opening the case res nova. If the agreement had been less explicit than it was, that “upon the foregoing facts, so stated and agreed upon, it is submitted to the court here to decide whether said complainant is entitled to dower in the said two blocks, &c.” and the desired end had appeared more equitable than it seems, there would have been more of appai’ent plausibility and fairness in this latter position. But when thus explicit; and the apparent end would seem to be, to enable the petitioner to maintain her claim of dower upon this issue by means of a fact, which, if it had been presented upon the determination of one of the issues she now claims to be closed, would have utterly and peremptorily excluded her from it, would seem to be neither plausible nor fair. Entertaining, however, different views from those seeming to be entertained by counsel, as to the issues legitimately opened by that portion of the answer that has been reinstated, and which are, in no degree, closed by any previous decision of this court in this cause, because never before entertained here, it will be unnecessary to decide the question thus mooted. For the reason, that when it might be conceded that the petitioner should have the fullest benefit of every fact contained in the agreed statement, in any way efficacious to rebut or repel the facts shown against her, under that portion of the answer in question, she must inevitably fall short of doing so, and hence would fail to maintain her case. It will be remembered that the estate of Robert Crittenden being conceded to have been insolvent, his widow’s claim to dower, in the lands alienated by him, rests essentially upon two facts: his title, in which hers inheres as a part, and his alienation of his title, in which hers thus inheres. When then it should be shown against any title which she might set up as his, that a valid title for the same lands had afterwards issued to a third person, from the primitive source of titles in this country, that fact would be no less efficacious to ignore the supposed alienation of the title originally set up by the petitioner, than to ignore the existence of that title in the husband as set up. If, therefore, in order to support her claim to dower thus attacked, the petitioner would be driven to show that her husband in his lifetime, was seized by relation of that identical new title, by reason of its having been acquired by her husband’s grantor with warranty, she would be equally driven to show that this very new title, under which she now makes her claim, was also alienated by her husband in his lifetime. Because, if he did not alienate it, he died seized of it, and his estate being insolvent, she was entitled to dower in no lands of which he died seized. If the title first set up by the petitioner had no efficacy for Crittenden, or was overslaughed as to him by a new after-acquired one, it would be equally so for his widow, because her title inheres in his and is a part of it. If Crittenden were alive and would be driven to claim an after acquired title, his widow, after his death, under like circumstances would be driven to that also, and claiming under that, if she should claim dower to land because of its alienation, it would be incumbent on her to show the alienation of the title she claimed under; otherwise her title to dower would not be made out when originally preferred, nor supported if attacked in such -a manner, If the fact had been otherwise, that Crittenden’s estate was solvent and his widow made claim to dower in the lands of which he died seized and possessed, and it should be shown against such a claim of dower, that a title had afterwards issued from the Federal Government to a third person, the force of that fact would be fully repelled by a showing on the part of the widow, that that title hadbeen conveyed to her husband’s grantor with warranty; because in snch a case, the only material part of the ground invaded, upon which her claim rested, was, that of her husband’s seizure at his death, and consequently it would be necessary only for her to continue to support seizin in him at his death. But inthe case at bar this cannot avail her unless, in addition to the continued support of seizin in his lifetime, she also continues to support alienation. Both ingredients being as essential for the sup-r port of a claim of dower in the one case, as the one ingredient is in the other case. Now, how can she continue to maintain alienation in the case at bar? Can she do so by bringing up the alienation of the old 'title, which she has confessed to be bad and avoided by showing the subsequent acquisition of the new title by her husband in his lifetime? Can she exhibit the alienation of an old title, which she has confessed to be no title, and abandoned for a new one, because she could no longer maintain the old one, and claim this to be alienation of the new one, on which she is now driven to predicate her claim. Truly this is a question of “ identity of title,” as remarked by the counsel for the petitioner in his argument, but not in the sense in which he used those terms. Can she claim that this court has adjudicated that question, and whether right or wrong, it is now the law of this cas'e, when, as we have seen by her own allegations and admissions of record, it was not only not presented here, but excluded by facts of record, which, as we shall presently see more distinctly, rendered it legally impossible that it could have been involved in any question adjudicated? How then, upon this record, can she show that the title, upon which she now grounds her claim, was aliened by her husband in his lifetime? Giving then to petitioner the full benefit of the argument urged for her, that the after acquired title was but the perfection of the old one — in which we confess we see no force, because the old title, as a title, was nothing and nothing has no properties — it would still result that she must show the conveyances from her husband of the perfected title, else the absurdity would ultimate, that the creditors of Critten-den — he having died insolvent and seized of it — would take the perfected title clear of any claim of dower, and still the widow would be endowed of it. Certainly then, in no other way upon this record can she maintain the alleged alienation, than by exhibiting the instruments of conveyance, which have been already held to have sufficient capacity to convey the supposed old title existing as that was alleged and admitted to exist from Crittenden to Johnson, not by way of mortgage incumbrance merely, but by way of absolute alienation. And this presents a point of law, which we have now to determine, and that is whether, previous to our statutory provision, (Dig. ch. , sec. ), where one made a conveyance of land by deed containing no covenant of warranty, having at the time no title to the land, a title subsequently acquired by such grantor would enure to the benefit of the grantee. It is evident from the numerous authorities which we have examined carefully, that a peculiar efficacy is given in the American courts to the covenant of warranty in a deed, for the transmission of an after acquired title to land. Its absence or presence is made almost invariably the sole test of the capacity of the deed for this purpose. The origin and growth of the doctrine, now almost universally recognized, that a deed with the covenant of warranty has, and one without it has not the capacity in question, is more curious and interesting than profitable, and although we have looked into it, and would, if necessary, be most inclined to favor the theory, plausible fo us, that it is really but little akin to the doctrine of estoppel, and is now resting on reasons beyond the mere prevention of circuity of action, we shall content ourselves with but the expression of our opinion, that the doctrine, as we have indicated it, is fully established by all the better considered opinions, when it has come in question in the American courts; and we therefore regard it as law. (See Smith’s Lead. Cas. Note to Doe vs. Oliver, p. , and the new work of Mr. Rawle on Covenants, ch. , generally, and page , for a citation in the notes of a number of American authorities.) In the enactment of our Legislature, however, before cited, this doctrine is so modified as to place all deeds, purporting to convey an estate in fee simple, or less estate, upon the same footiug; and it remains for us to determine whether that provision, which took effect on the 20th March, , can have a retroactive effect. The question has never been expressly made and decided in this court. In the case of Cock vs. Brogan and Thorn, ( Ark. R. ), the court seem to have given it a retroactive effect. There is no indication from the report of the case, that any question was made on the point, nor does it appear, whether the deeds, to which it was applied, contained covenants of warranty or not; nor does the court say explicitly that the title in that case passed by force of the statute: such however is strongly inferable. For aught that appears from the report of the case, all the deeds in question may have contained covenants of warranty, and therefore such a construction in that case may have been, not only “according” to the statute, but in accordance also with the law as it stood before, and therefore did not impair any contract, or disturb any vested right. At any rate there ceems to have been no question raised or discussed on the point. But although this is so, we would not lightly regard any ruling of this court if it seemed reconcilable with sound rules and principles of the law. This does not seem to us to be so. Its inevitable effect seems to be, to take the title of land from one and give it to another. The general rule, as to the construction of statutes, is that they “are not to be construed retrospectively, or to have a retroactive effect unless it shall clearly appear that it was so intended by the Legislature, and not even then if by such a construction the act would divest vested rights,” (Smith Com. Const. and St., law, p. , and note C, citing authorities). So Chancellor Kent says, •“The very essence of a new law is a rule for future cases.” No-va constiiutio futur isfor mam imponer e débet et non praeteritis,” is the language of Bracton, Liber IV, p. . So the same author says, “A retrospective statute affecting and changing vested rights, is very generally conceded in this country, as founded in unconstitutional principles, and consequently inoperative and void,” and he adds, “But this doctrine is not understood to apply to remedial statutes, which may be of a retrospective nature, provided they do not impair contracts, or disturb absolute vested rights, and only go to confirm rights already existing, and in furtherence of the remedy by curing defects, and adding to the means of enforcing existing obligations.” Under this latter quotation, doubtless, a statute of a retrospective nature, by which we understand of a capacity to retroact remedially, might be upheld as constitutional, and should be enforced to the extent indicated, if it clearly appeared that such was the intention of the Legislature; but although it might be of a remedial and retrospective nature, it could not be held to act retroactively in the absence of such clear manifestation of the intention of the Legislature, without violating the general rule of construction as to retrospective operation of statutes. There is nothing in the whole statute, of which the provision in question is a part, to show clearly that the Legislature were making rules for any other purpose than for future cases. If we were then to give this provision a retrospective action, it would be without the clear manifestation of the intention of the Legislature, that it should have that effect. And even if that intention was plainly manifested, it would still be a debatable question, whether or not it would come within the constitutional sphere of retrospective statutes! Under such circumstances we cannot hold it retrospective, feeling bound to hold it applicable to cases only which arose after its enactment. The deed in trust made by Crittenden, and the conveyance under it, being without warranty, it but remains to conclude that in our opinion the defendant was rightfully entitled to the decree • of the court below, and it must be affirmed.

1862667,Crittenden vs. Woodruff,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1851-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. When this cause was in this court before, at the January term, A. D. , several points of law were determined, the decree of the court reversed, and the cause sent back to be reheard with leave to both parties to take additional testimony, (Crittenden vs. Woodruff, 6th Eng. R. .) After the cause had reached the Circuit Court again, it was agreed of record between the parties, that William Russell claimed to be, and was recognized as one of the original proprietors of the town, now city of Little Rock, and that as such, he claimed lots No. , and , in Block No. ; the same being the lots in which the appellant claims dower. That Robert Crittenden, the grantor of the appellee, held a regular chain of title and conveyances for said lots, through Robert C. Oden, from said Russell to himself and that said lots are embraced wdthin the lot or south fractional part (south of the Arkansas river and west of the Quapaw line) of the northwest fractional quarter of fractional section two, in township one north of range twelve west. That said Crittenden and said Oden, claimed to have been two of the original proprietors of Little Rock. That the covenant of Roswell Beebe to the Mayor and Aldermen of the city of Little Rock, whereby he bound himself, upon the conditions expressed therein, to convey title to all persons who held lots, by a regular chain of conveyance, from the original proprietors of the town, should be read in evidence. That the fraction of land aforesaid, of which the lots in controversy are § part, was granted to Roswell Beebe by the United States, by patent bearing date the 25th of September, , in pursuance of an entry and purchase made by him in the Land Office at Little Reck, on the 6th day of June, A. D. ] , when a patent certifícate was issued to him upon which said patent for the land afterwards issued. In the chain of conveyances from the original proprietors of the town of Little Rock, Crittenden conveyed to Woodruff, on the 9th of July, , by deed with general warranty, during the coverture. After the land had been patented to Beebe, in consideration of the improvements that Woodruff had made upon the lots, and of the sum of five dollars in hand paid, Beebe conveyed the lots to Woodruff by a deed with general warranty wherein he referred to his covenant to the Mayor and Aldermen of Little Rock, and recited that he had made various quit claim deeds under said covenant, and had given due notice to all persons interested to apply for titles at their peril within a specified time, and that Woodruff had failed to apply. The entry of Beebe, the patent to him, his covenant to the Mayor and Aldermen, and his deed to Woodruff, were all subsequent to the death of Crittenden, and regularly shown in support of the answer of Woodruff, and in accordance with the ruling of this court in this cause, when it was here before, that the vendee of the husband is not estopped from affirmatively showing a want of title in his vendor. There was also a number of depositions taken after the cause had been sent back into the Circuit Court, touching the value of the lots, the improvements, rents, and other matters not necessary to be noticed; because they relate to questions that would arise only after the main question of the right of dower should be held in favor of the appellant. The cause was regularly reheard upon the petition, answers, exhibits, agreed facts and evidence, and the court, being of opinion against the appellant, denied her prayer and dismissed her petition, and she appealed to this court. The widow’s title to dower lives in her husband’s title to the land. Until actual admeasurement by metes and bounds, it is a mere potential interest, amounting to nothing more than a chose in action, and is not subject to seizure and sale by execution. (Pennington vs. Yell, 6th Eng. R. , and authorities there cited.) After it is set out she has an estate in dower of which she is the tenant, holding in virtue of her husband’s title in which hers inheres and is a part. When, therefore the title of the husband is overthrown, that of his wddow to dower must of necessity fall with it. When then Woodruff in this case shows that Critten ■ den had no title to the lots in question, he necessarily show's his widow has no title to be endowed of them, unless she can avoid this by showing that the title acquired from the Government which ignores her husband’s title, enured to him by some means as fully as if he had been actually seized in his lifetime. In this case there is no pretence that the husband was in fact seized in his lifetime, of this after acquired title, because it issued from the Federal Government after his death; and none that it passed to him in point of law through the instrumentality of instruments of conveyance executed before his death, relating to a point of time anterior to that time, because the title, since its emanation from the government, has passed into no such channel. On the contrary, it has passed directly from Beebe to Woodruff and cannot, by mere operation of law, ascend to Woodruff as it would have descended to Crittenden and through him to Woodruff, had Beebe granted to some grantor of Crittenden with warranty, the latter having granted to Woodruff in by deed of this class. This title was not the mere legal title, issued by the government to unite with some equitable title against the government existing before the entry of Beebe, but the complete title to the land, consummating the title of Beebe commencing by his entry. The entry of Beebe and the emanation of the patent to him in pursuance thereof, w’ere the beginning and ending of a complete title; and it is altogether different from a case where a husband might make an entry, procure the patent certificate, assign that certificate to another, and he obtain thereby the patent in his own name. Such facts, if shown against his widow’s claim to dower, would only ignore her husband’s mere naked legal title. But here a complete title is shown to have been acquired from the government, after the death of Crittenden, which excludes any title in him in his lifetime, and the inseparable claim of his widow to dower in virtue of it, unless she can avoid it by showing that this new title was her husband’s in his life time, either in fact or in law. To do this she sets up the covenant of Beebe to the Mayor and Aldermen, and insists that Beebe’s deed to Woodruff should be regarded as having been made in pursuance of that covenant,although upon its face the contrary appears. Conceding, for the sake of the argument, that this deed should be so regarded, the result would not be sufficient for her, because the covenant of Beebe in no way provides for the transmission of title to Crittenden. If he had lived the title could never have reached him, unless he had held under a conveyance from Woodruff and by this means brought himself within the description of persons provided for by the covenant, as Woodruff in fact was. And then he would have obtained it, not because' he had before executed one of the instruments of conveyance' which constituted the regular chain from one of the original pro-prietors of the town of Little Rock, or because he was himself one of these proprietors, but simply because he held lastly under' this chain of conveyances as Woodruff did. The covenant of Beebe in no way recognizes any rights in the-original proprietors as such, or in any grantee in any chain of conveyances from one of themfbut the moving cause of the covenant, which seems not otherwise than a gratuity on his part, seems to be to make provisions for a class of persons, who held lots under a supposed title, which had proven entirely worthless. When, therefore, one derived his claim to a conveyance of title from Beebe under his covenant, by-means of a chain of conveyance from one of the orignal proprietors, this whole chain and each of its links served but to identify him as the individual who was entitled, under the covenant, not to receive the title of the proprietor, who formed the first link, or any of the subsequent grantors who constituted the other links, but the title of Beebe himself, which displaced all other pretended titles and recognized' none of them. These conveyances then were relatively no more meritorious in procuring the title from Beebe, than the ink and paper upon which they were written — all serving the office of but means of identity. And the result as to the appellant would be the same upon the supposition, that the government had passed her Undisputed title to Beebe upon the trusts expressed in his covenant, because, in that case the only recognized equity would be that of the holders of the lots, without any regard to its derivation, further than for purposes of identity, the very recognition of equity in the particular class recognized, resting upon the same ground that they alone could claim it, whereby all others were excluded from the trust in not being provided for. And Crittenden, his widow and his heirs, being in this last category, could not possibly claim any benefits from a trust that was not wide enough to include them, and by this means claim a title that that trust declared should be conveyed to another. In any view then, it seems clear that under the covenant of Beebe, and consistent with it, it is not possible that the.title of Beebe could have ever been in Crittenden, either in fact or in law, and in no other view presented to üs, have we been enabled to see that Crittenden had any interest or estate, beyond a mere possession under an invalid title, much less such an estate as that in which a right of dower would inhere. And hence this after acquired title, thus set up and in no Way avoided, must we think, be held to be an effectual bar to the appellant’s claim to dower in the premises. We think therefore that the decree of the court below ought to be affirmed. Watkins, C J., not sitting.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862646,Borden vs. Fowler adm'r,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott, delivered the opinion of the Court. It appears that the plaintiff by his attorney notified the defendant, in writing, on the 6th day of October, , that on the 19th day of that month he should present to the Probate Court of Pulaski county, for allowance and classification, two several claims, which he held against the estate of his intestate, “one for three hundred and sixty - dollars, and the other for thirty - dollars,” when and where he might attend if he thought proper. xThis notice was regularly served by the sheriff. On the 7th of February, , the cause having been previously continued by both parties, a venire facias was issued on motion of both parties. The case, however, was the next day continued by the defendant, p,nd subsequently continued by consent until the 6th of February, A. D. , when both parties being present, the cause came on for hearing, and on motion of the defendant the court dismissed it for want of jurisdiction ; and the plaintiff, taking a bill of exceptions, appealed to the Circuit Court, where the judgment of the Probate Court was affirmed; and he brought the cause here by writ of error. Instead of making a literal copy of the bill of exceptions, the clerk has made a reference in it to three preceding pages of the transcript, for that portion of it which he would have otherwise transcribed again. From the whole of it, it appears that when the cause came up to be heard, the defendant moved to dismiss it, because it didnotappearthatthe claimhad been presented to the administrator before it was filed in the Probate Court. Whereupon the plaintiff moved for leave to introduce parol testimony to establish the opposite, which he was permitted to do against the objection of the defendant. From the endorsement of the clerk it appears that the claims, regularly verified by the affidavit of tbe claimant, were filed in the Probate Court on the 6th of October, , being the day of the-dateof the notice, and of the sheriff’s service of it upon the defendant, in response to which he had long before appeared in the Probate Court. The parol evidence, introduced to show a previous presentation of the claims to the defendant, was to the effect, that previous to the summer of , the attorney for the claimant informed the defendant that he had two claims, specifying the amount, to present against the estate of his intestate, and from the answer then made, the witness inferred that the defendant would not allow them. That afterwards, during the summer of that year, the same witness exhibited the claims to the defendant, verified as aforesaid, by laying the same down before him upon his table, and calling his attention to them, and informing him what they were, and left them there for some space of time, and afterwards returned for them, and was then informed by the defendant that they would not be allowed, but that he (the defendant) would not make an endorsement upon the papers to that effect. No copy of the claim, however, was ever given to the defendant at any time, and none was ever requested or demanded by him, nor does it appear that he gave any intimation, at the time of the alleged presentation, or at any time afterwards, until the cause came up for hearing in February, , that his refusal to allow the claims was in any way influenced by that consideration. The point made in the court below and insisted upon here, is, that because the copy of the claim was not furnished the administrator before the proceedings were commenced in the Probate Court, that court had no jurisdiction of the cause. The case of Hudson vs. Breeding, ( Eng. R. ,) cited by the defendant in error, is, where a judgment by default was quashed on certiorari, because it did not affirmatively appear that the claim allowed had been previously presented to the administrator, and that notice had been given him of the intended application to the Probate Court — the court refusing to make any presumption in favor of such a judgment without notice. And the case of Pennington vs. Gibson, ( Eng. R. ,) the other case cited by him, was also a case where there was no notice. It appeared upon the record that the claim had been presented for allowance and refused, but it did not appear that the defendant had received notice of the intended application to the Probate Court. Besides, the doctrines of these cases, as to jurisdiction, have been since materially modified by the case of Borden et al. vs. The State use &c. ( Eng. R. ,) and subsequent cases in this court (see also the previous case of Wilson vs. Dean ( Eng. R. ,) for the principle as to jurisdiction, upon which the case of Brodie vs. Whitfield was overruled.) The provision of the statute for the copy was evidently designed to afford an executor or administrator such information as would enable him to act advisedly, in allowing or refusing to allow a claim presented against the estate of his testator or intestate, and in case he allowed it, to place in his possession accurate data for the list of claims he is required to keep, and for their classification and return into the Probate Court annually under the provisions of the administration law, (Dig. p. , sec. . In this case it appears that the orignal was not only exhibited to the administrator, but was left in his personal custody for some space of time after having his attention called to it, and having been informed what it was; and that it was afterwards filed in the Probate Court on the day when he was served with a notice by the sheriff that the claimant would apply there for its allowance, where it remained on file, subject to his inspection for the space of two years and four months, during which time he was a partyto the cause in court, either continuing it himself, ormutually with the other party consenting to continuances. Doubtless, under the statute, an executor or administrator is entitled to thp copy in question unless he voluntarily dispenses with it, or waives it by his own laches ; consequently for that 'cause alone he may refuse to allow a claim, or abate the proceeding in the Probate Court for a like reason; but he must interpose the objection in apt time, otherwise it cannot avail. And although in that court he may interpose it by motion, instead of by plea, because in such cases the manner of proceeding is “summary without the forms of pleading,” (Dig. p. , sec. ,) yet that does not change the nature of the defence set up. It remains, as it is, essentially matter in abatement of the suit and must be governed as to time, &c., by the rules governing pleas in abatement, as held in Ross et al. vs. Davis, ( Ark. R. ,) and in other cases in this court. When these rules are applied to the proceedings in this case, the filing of the claim in the Probate Court, and the service of the notice upon the administrator being taken to be equivalent to the writ and declaration in an ordinary suit at law, we think the motion was clearly out of time, and for this cause ought to have been overruled. The judgment of the Circuit Court is therefore reversed and the cause remanded to that court to be there heard de novo upon the merits.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862737,Reed vs. Akin,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an appeal from the justice’s court to the Circuit Court, where, upon a trial de novo, the original defendant, after admitting the plaintiff’s demand, offered to prove an account due from the plaintiff to him, as a matter of set-off, but upon the objection, that the defendant had not given the plaintiff proper-notice of the proposed set-off, while the case was in the justice’s court, the Circuit Court ruled out the proposed off-set. This action of the Circuit Court is the error assigned here. It appears from the justice’s transcript, that upon the return day of the summons, both parties appeared before the justice, and that the defendant then filed a bill of the particulars of a set-off demanded by him. This appears both by an entry upon the docket and the justice’s endorsement of filing upon the bill of particulars. The defendant afterwards, the same day, continued the cause for a month. At the next trial day both parties were again present, and the cause was again continued by plaintiff. At the third trial day, both parties were again present, and, upon the hearing, the justice ruled out the off-set upon the ground, as stated in his transcript, of the “defendant’s failing to give the plaintiff notice of his off-set,” and thereupon gave judgment-for the plaintiff’s demand, and the defendant appealed. Upon the trial in the Circuit Court, the defendant admitted the correctness of the plaintiff’s demand, but insisted upon the offset, that had been ruled out by the justice, and made additional proof by J. B. Lewis, who seems to have acted as his attorney, before the justice, that on the original trial day before the justice at a time when the plaintiff was present in the house and before the cause was continued, the witness notified the justice that he had an off-set to file in the case, read over the items in the hearing of the plaintiff, (but did not know whether the plaintiff actually did hear him,) and then handed it to the justice to file among the papers. The statute provides that, upon the appeal, no other cause of action shall be tried in the Circuit Court than the same that was “tried before the justice, and no set-off shall be pleaded that was not pleaded before the justice, if the summons was served on the person of the defendant, (Dig. p. , sec. .) It also provides that, “In order to entitle a defendant to set-off any demand, he must give notice thereof to the plaintiff, either verbal or written, before the jury is sworn or the trial submitted to the justice,” (Dig. p. , se. , lut misprinted .) “And that when a set-off is founded upon an instrument in writing executed by the plaintiff, or his testator or intestate, or iipon an open account, he must, at the time of giving such notice, file with the justice such instrument, or a bill of the items of such account,” (Dig. p. , sec. .) Considering together these provisions of the statute we think the Legislature, without any intention to prescribe any particular mode of communicating notice, simply designed to secure to the plaintiff notice in fact or its equivalent, as a pre-requisite for the defendant to set up and prove an off-set. This is strongly indicated by the indefinite provision,that notice maybe given either verbally or in writing, without any other regulation except that, as to time, it must be given before the jury is sworn or the trial is submitted to a justice. Hence it would be as well communicated indirectly as directly; either through the instrumentality of writing, or by word of mouth, provided actual notice be in fact carried home from the defendant to the plaintiff. Indeed, so long as the cause remained pending and undetermined before the justice, it-would be in accordance with the spirit of the statute for the justice to receive a set-off at any time, and if the filing, whether before or on the day of trial, be a surprise to. the plaintiff, he might claim a continuance, but being in court he is presumed to have notice. When the testimony of Lewis is considered in connection with what is legitimately to be inferred from the justice’s transcript, the whole taken together are equivalent, in our opinion, to proof of actual notice. Whether or not the testimony of Lewis was produced in the justice’s court, does not in any manner appear, but this can in no way affect the existence of the fact of notice, upon which depended the right of the defendant to be heard as to his set-off, before the justice as well as upon his appeal before the Circuit Court, where the case is heard de novo absolutely, and hot de novo upon condition that some error of fact or law may be found as in cases of appeal from the Probate Court. Upon the establishment in the Circuit Court of this pre-requisite to his set-off, it would be as unreasonable to refuse to hear him as to the whole of it, as it would be to deny him a hearing, as to some one item only, in another case where, upon a regular trial upon the merits in the justice’s court, he had failed to make proof as to this item only, although he had proved all the others, and was now ready to prove this also. We think, therefore, the court erred in ruling out the off-set, and for this error the judgment ought to be reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions that the Circuit Court hear the case de novo, and allow the defendant below to establish his off* set on file by sufficient evidence if he can.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862684,Faulkner et al. vs. Thompson et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker, delivered the opinion of the Court. The complainants, as Trustees of the Real Estate Bank, filed their bill in chancery against the defendants, in the Phillips Circuit Court, upon the following state of facts. On the 11th day of September, , the defendants executed to the Real Estate Bank of the State of Arkansas their promissory note, by which they jointly and severally promised to -pay to the Bank the sum of $,, for value received. On the 2d day of April, , the Bank by deed conveyed its property, including its debts and choses in action, to the complainants and others, (one of whom was the defendant Biscoe) in trust for the payment of its debts. That said trustees and their successors remained in office until the 2d of April, , at which time complainants and defendant Biscoe were continued as residuary trustees of said Bank. That the Bank by her Cashier assigned the note, by written endorsement thereon, to the original trustees. ,That Biscoe accepted the trust and entered upon the duties thereof, and that the note remains unpaid, and cannot be recovered upon by a suit at common law. Upon demurrer to the bill final decree was rendered against the complainants, from which they have appealed to this court. The grounds of demurrer were, first, that the complainant’s remedy was at law and not in equity, second, that the cause of action was barred by the statute of limitation. The first ground of demurrer, we think, is not well taken, Biscoe occupied the two fold attitude of payor and assignee, whereby he became also payee, in consequence of which the recovery by the trustees (if indeed they had any at law against either of the defendants) was not clear and adequate, such as to deprive them of the benefit of the more enlarged powers of the court of chancery to afford relief. But we think the second ground of demurrer to the bill well taken. By the complainant’s own showing five and a half years had elapsed between the time when the note fell due and the commencement of this action. The recovery was upon a simple contract debt. The statute had commenced running when the Bank, by her own voluntary act, transferred the note to one of the payors and others in trust. The defendants were not responsible for this; the principal in the note and one of his securities were in no way connected with the transaction. So that even if Biscoe’s acceptance of the trust should, as to himself, be held a suspension of the operation of the statute, (which we think was not the case] it cerainly could not be said to affect the lights of his co-defendants. On the contrary thereof, the statute having commenced running before the assignment continued to run irrespective of it. That the statute may be relied upon as a bar to a recovery in chancery as well as at common law, as a general proposition, is ,well settled, and has been recognized by this court in the case of Taylor vs. Adams, July term . And in cases of concurrent jurisdiction courts of equity act in obedience to the statute rather than by analogy in their application of it. That the statute may be interposed, and that this case is of that class, in which the courts of chancery act in obedience to the statute, there can be no doubt, and the question to be considered is as to whether the defence should be interposed by plea or answer, or whether when the facts appear upon the face of the bill, it may not also avail as a defence by demurrer to the bill. As a matter .of practice this defence is most usually interposed by plea, or as in the case of Taylor vs. Adams, relied upon by the defendant in his answer; and we apprehend (unless where time under the circumstances of the case is to be considered in affording or refusing the relief sought,) that in all cases, over which the courts of .chancery exercise exclusive original jurisdiction, and in all others where the facts disclosed by the complainant in his bill do not show that the right to recover is barred by limitation of time, this defence must be interposed either by plea or be relied upon by the defendant in his answer. But where the cause of action is one over which the courts of law and equity may be said to have concurrent jurisdiction, or where the cause of action is such that in a proceeding at law the statute bar could be interposed (in all of which we have seen thatthe courts actin obedience to the statute rather than by analogy in its application, and the bill upon its face shows that the right of action is barred by lapse of time) the practice seems to be well settled that the defect may be reached by demurrer .to the bill. Such would seem to be the rule laid down by Judge Story in his Com. on Eq. Pr. , and Daniell's Ch. Pl. & Pr. vol. , ; and Judge Washington in the case of Wisner vs. Barnett et al., Wash. C. C. R. , concludes his review of the English and American decisions thus: “Upon the whole I incline to think that in cases where from the allegations in the bill, the statute of limitations may be urged as a bar to the remedy, ifmay be done in the form of demurrer.” The case before us, both as regards the allegations in the bill, and the nature of the demand sought to be recovered, comes directly within the rule laid down by these authorities. The demurrer was properly sustained. Decree affirmed.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862651,Carnall as ad. vs. Wilson,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker, delivered the opinion Of the Court-. This is a suit in chancery, brought in the. Crawford Circuit Court for the purpose of having corrected a mistake in the description of certain lands to which the complainant sets up title. The substance of the complaint is, that John Dillard, who resided in the county of Crawford, was the legal owner of several quarter and fractional quarter sections of land; composing one tract of about acres, on which he had a farm and resided with his family in the year , and continued there to reside until his death. On the 14th day of September of that year, judgment was rendered against him in the Crawford Circuit Court, in favor of Thomas E. and Heiro T. Wilson, for $,, upon which execution issued on the 3d of August, , which at the instance of Dillard, was levied upon the tract of land oil which he so resided, but that the sheriff, in recording his levy upon the writ, misdescribed several of the tracts of land levied upon, by recording other tracts, not the property of Dillard, instead of those actually levied upon; that afterwards, at the instance of Dillard, his lands were appraised, and because no one would bid two-thirds of their value, they were returned not sold. On the 30th August, , an alias fi. fa. issued, on the back of which was endorsed the former levy, and that under this writ the sheriff advertised and sold the land on the 25th of September, "" , at public sale, to George W. Paschal for $, to whom he executed' a deed for the same. That the same mistake committed in recording the return- of the levy upon the original writ was continued in the after proceedings including the advertisements of the land, and the deed to Paschal; but that the actual levy and sale were of Dillard’s land. It appears that Dillard was in embarrassed circumstances, and that several other judgments had been rendered in said court against him, all of which as well as that of the Wilsons’ were under the control of Paschal for collection. That at the instance of Dillard, it was agreed between himself and Paschal, that Paschal should buy the property, then recognized by Dillard as his homestead place, and give him (Dillard) twelve months to redeem the same by paying Wilson’s judgment, and part of one of the other judgments under Paschal’s control as collector. That Dillard died without having redeemed the property, and that Paschal afterwards, on the 14th day of September, , conveyed the land to Joseph H. Bailey, by quit claim deed, for $,, and that Bailey on the same day sold itto complainant for $,, payable in twelve months, and took from complainant a bond lor the payment of the purchase money, and executed to him a covenant, by which he bound himself to convey to complainant the land upon the payment of the bond for $,. That both Paschal and Bailey in good faith sold, and intended to convey the Dillard homestead place, but were led into a mistake in the description of the land by following that in the sheriff’s deed. Soon after the purchase óf complainant the mistake was discovered, to correct which this suit is brought. The plaintiff in execution, the administrator and heirs of Dillard, Paschal and Bailey are made defendants, and with the exception of the administrator and one of Dillard’s children, an infant, the answers may be considered as a full and circumstantial admission of the material- facts in issue. The- administrator denies all knowledge or information with regard to the levy, or sale of the property, or of any knowledge, understanding or agreement of his intestate, except that which he derived from the complainant’s bill, and touching these points does not answer. The other allegations are from information and belief admitted. The infant defendant answers by guardian, and his rights are as fully protected as if he had by answer denied each allegation in the bill. The main fact put in issue by the answer, is the fact of the alleged mistake; and preliminary to an examination of the evidence, is the question presented upon the exception to the admission of the deposition of Ogden. The objection to his evidence is, that he is the security of the complainant to defendant Bailey for the purchase money of the land in suit. It seems that Bailey at the outset was content to take the complainant’s bond, payable at twelve months, for the purchase money, and to hold the land as secui’ity for the pa3'ment thereof. But when he ascertained that there was a mistake in the numbers of the land, whereby his security for the purchase money to the value of the lands not embraced in the deed had failed, he became dissatisfied and thereupon, by way of additional security Ogden, Paschal, and others, executed to him a note for $, payable at the same time the first note was to have been paid, with a memorandum endorsed thereon by Bailey, that the payment of the bond first given should be a discharge of the note,, whereby Ogden in effect became the security for the purchase money for the land, part of which is now here in suit. This additional security was taken in consequence of the discovered mistake. There can be no question of Ogden’s immediate interest in the suit; indeed this is broadly admitted by counsel who notwithstanding argue that his interest is equally balanced, because, let the suit be decided for or against the complainant he must be discharged. If for him, by requiring the $, for which he is bound to- be paid before the decree is rendered, or if against him,, the court must necessarily rescind the contract, and cancel the note. As regards the first proportion, although the court might have decreed the payment ofthe purchase money at that time, it did not necessarily follow that such should be the decree : and the decree rendered in this cause shows that such was not the case; so far from it, the express terms of the decree are that the security shall not be discharged. And, as respects the .other alternative, a rescisión of the contract is wholly inconsistent, as well with the allegations as the prayer for relief; aud the answer of Bailey furnishes no ground for enlarging the issue. If the plaintiff had doubts as to his title to the specific relief prayed, he ■should have presented his case in a double, aspect, and prayed relief accordingly. Story Equity Pl. . Moore vs. Madden, Eng. . Bailey no doubt was willing that the correction should be made, his answer is alone responsive to that state of case, but it by no means follows that he would assent to have his contract can-celled, and the evidences of debt surrendered, upon a mere question of partial failure of consideration, nor can it be that a chancellor would decree that he should do so, unless upon an issue for that purpose and upon which he might be heard in defence, it be found equitable that it should be done, so that the witness could not -escape his liabilily upon either alternative; certainly not in the last, and it seems he did not in the first. He was clearly incompetent to testify, and his deposition should have been suppressed. The remaining evidence is by no means satisfactory upon the most important points in issue: the actual levy and sale of the land not included in the sheriff’s return. As regards the levy, the facts that the process was against Dillard, that there was returned upon the writ about the same quantity of land really owned by him, that the valuation was taken at his instance, and that the appraisers did actually appraise the property known as Dillard’s homestead place, are all strong circumstances, and yet there is no positive proof that the sheriff ever intended to levy, or did levy upon these lands; but on the contrary, there are his official returns on several writs, his advertisement and deed, all his official acts which show affirmatively that he did not make such levy. As regards the sale, but one witness is found to testify. He is strongly impressed with the belief that the sheriff announced to the by-standers that he offered the Dillard homestead place; of this he is not positive, and does not remember the language used, nor can he say positively, that the sheriff did more than read off the numbers from his levy, but thinks he did. This witness says that there were some forty persons present, and the fact that out of that number but one witness was examined as to the understanding at the time of the sale, in regard to the property sold, renders it improbable that if the property was offered as Dillard’s homestead, it was generally so understood by the bidders and by-standers. The evidence, upon which a written instrument or contract is altered or corrected, must be clear and free from doubt. In Henkle vs. The Royal Exchange Insurance Company, Ves. , Lord Hardwick said the court had jurisdiction to relieve in re-. spect to a plain mistake in contracts in writing. In Ingram vs. Child Bro. , Lord Thurlow said, “that a mistake creating an equity de hors the deed, should be proven as much to the satisfaction of the court as if admitted.” Judge Story in United States vs. Monroe, Mason , said “in cases of asserted mistakes in written instruments, it is not denied that a court of equity may reform the instrument, but such a court is very slow to exercise such an authority, and it requires the strongest and clearest evidence to establish the mistake. It is not sufficient that there be some reason to presume a mistake, the evidence must be clear, unequivocal and. decisive.” And in Gillaspie vs. Moore, Johns, Ch. Rep., Chancellor Kent reviews many of the English decisions and fully recognizes the rule, that in all such cases the mistake must be clearly and fully proven. So that this rule, when applied to contracts, may be considered as well settled, and there certainly is no good reason why the rule should not also be applied with equal force to the return ot a sworn officer, and to his deed deliberately made and approved in court. Whilst therefore, corrections may be made of mistakes when clearly and satisfactorily proven to be such, less than this strictness would be attended with the most serious consequences, particularly where the instrument to be reformed or changed is, as in this instance, the evidence of title to real estate, When tested by this rule, the evidence before us, although it does raise a strong presumption that the levy and sale were made or intended to be made of Dillard’s entire homestead tract, is not of that clear and conclusive character to entitle the complainant to relief. We have not overlooked the ground taken by counsel, that the sale was made under a fi.fa., with a former levy endorsed thereon, instead of a ven. ex. to sell the lands so levied upon, and that the whole tract was offered together instead of separate tracts, and also that the lands now sought to be recovered were (if sold at all) sold without having been previously advertised. These are all questions which may well be considered in a suit like this, in the nature of a bill for specific performance, because courts of equity will not interfere to decree specific execution of a contract, where manifest wrong or injustice would result from it. To do so would be giving aid to consummate a wrong commenced, which is never done, Story Equity . It is true, that in this case the process and proceedings under which the sale was made, in connexion with the return, in which no formal levy appears to have been made under the second writ, are of a doubtful character, (in regard to which, however, it is not necessary, under the circumstances of this case, to express any opinion) and that the sale of the lands in dispute (if made at all) was made without notice and purchased by the attorney for the plaintiff in execution for $, when, according to the appraised value made some time before the sale took place, they were worth $, or more, and by evidence in this case, since the sale, $. §o that the land was sold in all reasonable probability, for less than one-sixth of its actual value. All of these circumstances would have been presented for consideration if the mistake as alleged had been satisfactorily proven. .But as .such proof has not been adduced, in view of the whole case .and the peculiar attitude in which the parties are presented upon the record, and the facts connected with their respective fights, we .think the decree of the Circuit Court should be reversed and the bill dismissed. Let the decree be reversed, and the cause be remanded with instructions to dismiss the bill with costs. Watkins, C. J., not sitting.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862708,Cloyes et al. vs. Beebe et al.; Cloyes et al. vs. Newton et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. This action of ejectment having progressed to a trial by jury of the issue made upon the plea of not guilty, the plaintiffs, to sustain the issue upon their part, after having adduced evidence to prove before the jury that Nathan Cloyes, the elder, died in the year , or , leaving issue of lawful marriage four children surviving him, to-wit, Lydia Louisa, Mary E., Nathan Henry and Thomas; that Lydia Louisa, the eldest of the four, was born in , and the other three, successively, at periods of about two years between births: that Thomas, the youngest, had died-some years before in infancy: that Lydia Louisa was married to Robinson Lytle, one of the plaintiffs, and Mary E., to to Elias Hooper, another of said plaintiffs, of which latter marriage issue had been born alive; then offered to read in evidence, and produced the same to the court, a deed of conveyance duly executed; by which the said plaintiffs, Nathan H. Cloyes,'' and his wife, had conveyed to another of said plaintiffs, the said Absalom Fowler and his heirs and assigns forever, previous to the commencement of this suit, one-fourth part of the entire right, title, interest and claim of the said Nathan H., and his wife, in and to the north-west fractional quarter of section number two, of township number one north of range number twelve west, containing about thirty - acres, it being stated in said deed upon its face, that said land was held by a pre-emption right; and at the same time of offering said deed as evidence, the plaintiffs stated to the court that they were prepared to prove and would prove, in connection therewith, that the lands and lots in controversy are on and embraced within said fractional quarter section of land, that the defendants were in possession of the same at and before the commencement of this suit: that the same are situated in the county of Pulaski; that under the act of Congress of the 29th of May, A. D. , granting pre-emption i-ights to settlers upon the public lands, the Register and Receiver of the proper land office in Arkansas, upon evidence produced to their satisfaction, granted a pre-emption to the said Nathan Cloyes, the elder, now deceased, in his lifetime, to the aforesaid fractional quarter section of land, on the 28th day of May, A. D. , at which time the surveys were not perfected and returned: that afterwards, and after the death of the said Nathan, the elder, his children and heirs at law aforesaid paid to the Receiver of public moneys at said land office, the minimum price for said fractional quarter section of land, as fixed by the laws of the United States, and also for two small adjoining fractions claimed by them under the same right, and took said Receiver’s receipt therefor, bearing date the 5th of March, A.D. , on which said receipt the said Receiver endorsed, of the same date, that a part of the land so paid for, to-wit: the north-west fractional quarter section, formed a part of the location made by Gov. Pope, in selecting one thousand acres adjoining Little Rock, granted by Congress to raise a fund for building a court house and jail for the territory of Arkansas, and that such endorsement was made by the direction of the commissioner of the General Land Office. And .the said plaintiffs, at the same time, offered to prove that such location so made by Governor Pope, was made after the said grant of the pre-emption, and was null and void. And they offered no other evidence, and stated they had no other to show .title in the said plaintiff, Fowler. But the defendants objected .to the said deed being read in evidence, upon the single ground that such conveyance to the said plaintiff, Absalom Fowler, gave him no title by which he could, jointly with his co-plaintiffs or otherwise, maintain an action of ejectment; and this objeclion having been sustained by the Circuit Court and said deed rejected and excluded upon that ground, the plaintiffs took their bill of exceptions, from which the foregoing facts appear. And final judgment having been rendered against them, they brought their case here by writ of error. The question presented to us is, whether or not this specific objection, no other having been made to the testimony offered, was well taken. Our statute authorizes the action of ejectment in all cases, where the plaintiff is legally entitled to the possession of the premises (Dig. ch. , p. ; sec. ), and in all cases where he “claims the possession under or by virtue offirst, an entry made with the Register and Receiver of the proper land office of the United States; second, a pre-emption right under the laws of the United States; third, where an improvement has been made by him on any of the public lands of the United States, whether the lands have been surveyed or not, and where any person, other than those to whom the right of action is given by the preceding clauses of this section, is in possession of such improvement” (id. sec. ): and on the trial it will be sufficient for him to “show that, at the time of the commencement of the action, the defendant was in possession of the premises claimed, and that the plaintiff had title thereto, or had the right to the possession thereof as is declared by this act to be sufficient to maintain the action of ejectment.” (id. sec., .) We think it clear, from the phraseology of this statute, when considered in connection with its remedial nature and obvious general design, that it was not the purpose of the Legislature to confine its benefits to the purchaser in the first instance and to the pre-emptor in the second, but equally to extend them to all persons, who might lawfully succeed to their rights. The language used is certainly sufficiently comprehensive for this; and the lawful successors to such rights are as clearly within the mischief as the original purchaser or pre-emptor. Indeed, ’not only would such a narrow construction of the statute be against its obvious spirit, and contract the generality of the expressions used, but it would be to lose sight of so much of the every day transactions of common life in this State as relate to the tranfer from hand to hand of these imperfect titles of land, and to suppose they were unknown to the Legislature. In accordance with this view of the statute, this court held in the case of McLarren vs. Wicker and others, ( Eng. R. p. ), that a patent certificate issued to the father was sufficient to enable his heir to maintain the action of ejectment. It is true that, in that case, the court rested the transfer of the title to the heir, not upon descent, but upon the act of Congress, which declares that when a patent issued to one who is dead, in pursuance of a certificate of purchase issued in his lifetime, the title shall enure to his heirs. The result, however, is the same, whatever may work the transfer, because the action in that case was sustained, not upon the patent but upon the certificate, although brought by the heirs. There can be no good reason why, if the successor to the original purchaser or to the pre-emptor, can maintain the action when he succeeds to the rights of the purchaser or pre-emptor, by direct operation of law, that he should not do so if he succeeds to those rights by lawful acts of the parties. In both cases he succeeds by operation of law; in the one case, directly; and in the other, indirectly by its operation. It is true that, at common law, if a man had in him only the right of possession or property, he could not convey it to another,' lest, in the language of the ancient law, “pretended titles might be granted to great men, whereby justice might be trodden down and the weak oppressed.” But this was for the feudal reason that possession was an indispensable element of alienation, of which the law was so tenacious, even after the statute of uses, that a pretence title itself, would not prevent the seizin of the land from passing from the bargainor to the bargainee by virtue of that statute, where he was actually seized, although his title was but pretended. At the same time reversions and vested remainders might be granted, because it was considered that the possession of the particular tenant was the possession of him in reversion or in remainder, and was not adverse. And upon the same principle the better and more recent authorities show that an equitable interest was always assignable; because after the sale, out of which an equitable interest grew, the vendor and those under him, would hold as trustees for the vendee and those under him, and therefore there could be no such adverse possession as to make the title pretended. But every vestige of this feudal doctrine, which thus restrained the alienation of real estate, has been swept off by our statute, which enacts that, “ Any person claiming title to any real estate may, notwithstanding there may be an adverse possession thereof, sell and convey his interest in the same manner and with like effect as if he was in the actual possession thereof.” (Dig. ch. , p. , sec. ). The next section {id. ), declares that “ The term real estate, as used in this act, shall be construed as co-extensive in meaning with ‘lands tenements and hereditaments’ and as embracing chattels real.” And Sir Edward Coke says, that of these three, “hereditaments” is by far the largest and most comprehensive expression, because it included not only lands and tenements, but whatever may be inherited, be it corporeal or incorporeal, real, personal or mixed. And thus it appears that, although at common law, there were certain rights to and interests in real estate, that for want of possession, either actual or constructive, could not be alienated to a stranger, although they could be released or devised by will, or would pass to the heir or executor — as contingencies and mere possibilities — such is the comprehensiveness of our statute in embracing hereditaments in the term “real estate,” that that distinction is also annihilated, and therefore, in this State, whatever interest in real estate may be inherited, may be bargained, sold and conveyed,. And it is expressly declared by our statute of Descents, that the “real estate” in that statute contemplated, is every “estate, interest and right, legal and equitable, in lands, tenements and hereditaments, except such as are determinable, or are extinguished by the death of the intestater seized or possessed thereof, in any manner other than by lease for years and estate for the life of another person.” (Dig.ch. , secs. , ). The result is, that as at the common law, all persons in possession were, prima facie, capable both of conveying and purchasing, unless the law had laid them under some particular disability personally, or as to the subject matter, so under the operation of our statutory regulations all persons having an inherita-' ble right, interest or title, in or to any real estate, are pl'ahed in the same condition as to alienation or purchase. And there being no pretence of personal disability as to these parties,* and none as to the subject matter in consequence of the operation of our statute in enlarging the right of alienation and purchase almost to an unlimited extent in this respect, we cannot doubt but that, under the deed of conveyance offered in eyidence, if regularly executed and valid in other respects, Fowler succeeded lawfully to so much of the right, interest and estate of Nathan-H. Cloyes, as the deed purported to convey, as fully as it came-to the latter from his deceased father by direct operation of law.. We therefore think it clear that Fowler was a proper party plaintiff, equally entitled with the heirs to maintain ejectment under-our statute, and that the objection in question was not well taken,, and ought to have been overruled by the court below. For this error the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded to be proceeded with. Watkins, C. J. not sitting in this cause.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862660,The State Bank vs. Byrd et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott, delivered the opinion of the court. On the 3d day of October, , the Bank declared in debt upon a promissory note made by the defendant,- on the 22d day of November, , payable months after date. There was but one count in the declaration. The defendant by plea interposed the statute of limitation. The Bank replied, first; That on the day of the execution of the note the defendants, together with their wives, executed a mortgage to her, upon certain real estate, to secure the debt sued ' for; in which it was recited that by the rules and regulations of the Bank the note in question was payable in nine annual installments, the first payable twelve months after the date thereof, at which time, in addition thereto, twelve months interest was to be paid in advance on the residue of the debt, and so on from year to year until the whole debt should be paid, and providing that in case the payments were so regularly made, that the conveyance should be void, but on failure in all or either of said payments, the sheriff of Pulaski county should sell and convey the mortgaged premises and apply the proceeds to the payment of the debt; and averring that on the 1st March, A. D. , the debt being then wholly in arrears, neither the first nor any sub1 sequent instalment or any interest having been paid, the sheriff, in pursuance of the request of the Bank and of the provisions of the mortgage, advertised a sale of the mortgaged premises, to take place in September following; whereupon Trapnali, claiming to be the owner of the mortgaged premises, filed a bill against the Bank, and procured an injunction restraining the Bank and the sheriff from proceeding any further with the sale, and that the bill is still pending and undetermined, and the injunction remains in force, by means whereof, as is alleged, the Bank was prevented from pursuing her remedy on the note aforesaid. The second replication avers that the mortgage was made cotemporaneously with the note declared upon, as part and parcel of the same transaction, to secure the payment of the debt, and that in the mortgage deed it was stipulated and declared that said note was payable in nine annual instalments, the first payable the 22d November, A- D. , with interest, in advance on the residue of the debt, and yearly thereafter as set out in the first replication, and that the Bank accepted the mortgage, and that the same is still in force and in no way satisfied. After oyer of the mortgage deed had been craved and granted, the defendant demurred to both replications, in which the plaintiff joined; and the law having been found for the defendant and the plaintiff electing to rest, judgment was rendered for the defendant, and the Bank brought her case here by writ of error. The Bank seems to rely in this court exclusively upon her first replication, and cites in support of it the twenty-seventh section-of the limitation statute, {Dig, ch. , p. ), which provides that-“whenever the commencement of any suit shall be stayed by an-injunction of any court of equity, the time during which such in-junction shall be in force, shall not be deemed any portion of the-time in this act limited for the commencement of such suit.” ‘ If the Bank was proceeding to foreclose her mortgage, and the sta-tute of limitations had been interposed, this provision of the sta-tute might, with more plausibility have been relied upon; but we think it clear that it cannot avail her, to displace the bar in this case, where she is preceding at law to recover the debt that was intended to be secured by the mortgage. The replication does not set.up that the Bank was enjoined from commencing any action to recover the debt, but from any “further proceedings in the matter of said- sale,” and “restraining the said Bank and the said sheriff from- selling said lots.” For aught that appears to the contrary in the replication, the Bank might have commenced a suit at law, to recover the debt for which the mortgage was but a security, at any time for near seven years, next before this action was commenced; and indeed this suit was commenced and is still prosecuted, as appears by this replication, pending the very injunction pleaded in avoidance of the statute bar. It was the remedy in rem only, that was enjoiued, not the independent remedy in personam, now sought in vain by reason of the statute bar, which lapse of time has enabled the defendants effectually to interpose against it. The second replication is equally bad,-because it does not set up any matter in support of the promise declared-upon, but a different contract, which, if effectual for the purpose- for which it is-set up, would be equally effectual to show that the Bank had no right to maintain an action of debt at all, when this one was commenced.

1862626,Earle et al. vs. Byrd et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott, delivered the opinion of the Court. This application, founded upon a suggestion of diminution supported by affidavit, is to perfect the transcript of the record in this case, either by appending to it the certified copy presented, of the motion for a new trial in the court below, which was omitted by the clerk, as is alleged; or by permitting the clerk, otherwise, to -amend the transcript already certified in return of the writ of error, or- by permitting the plaintiff in error to withdraw his assignment and have a special certiorari. The writ of error in this case was regularly returned into this court, at the January term, A. D. , and the defendant in error then entered his appearance to it by counsel. Afterwards errors were assigned, to which a joinder was interposed, and the cause argued and submitted by both of the parties. In the following July term, this court, upon looking into the record, and discovering the supposed diminution, pointed it out to the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, that he might have an opportunity to rid his clients of the difficulty. And this application, in its manifold aspect, is probably designed for this end, and presents the question whether or not it can avail. No rule of practice is perhaps better settled in this court and elsewhere in courts of error, than that after joinder in error, no diminution can be alleged; and the reason is, because it is by this means admitted by all the parties, that the i-ecord, upon which they have joined issue, is a true and perfect one; and therefore neither party can or should be permitted to contradict their own admissions: So well settled, indeed, that it was remarked in the case of Cunningham vs. Ashley and others ( Ark. R. p. ), that “after the case is submitted the suitor can no longer be heard, and strictly speaking it is a contempt of court for him to attempt to be heard in any way.” But although this is so, no admissions of the parties can or ought to restrain the court, as a question of power, from looking into the record before them. Accordingly in the plenitude of its authority, to be exercised in sound discretion, this court may, at any time pending a writ of error, whether before or after assignment of errors or after the joinder therein, ex-officio, award a certiorari to supply any defect that may appear, either in the body of the record, or in any of its branches. But among the rules of practice governing this discretion, is that, “though the court, ad informandum conscientiam curiae, will award a certiorari to affirm a judgment, they will never award one to reverse it or make error.” ( Saunders Rep. , a, in the note and the old cases there cited). This rule is as old and as well settled, and as universally recognized as the other, and was applied in this court as early as July term, , and often sine e, (The Auditor vs. Woodruff and another, Ark. R ); and there has never been any special case here demanding a departure from it within our knowledge. This latter rule of practice rests upon no sympathy for the defendant in error, although by the operation of the former rule his laches have cut him off from all means of helping himself, while the plaintiff in error under like laches would still have ample means of self protection in his right to dismiss his suit and sue out another u rit; because laches can never lay any foundation for indulgence, and it is always time enough for a party, either plaintiff or defendant, after he has presented the merits of his case, to demand the correlative constitutional duty of having it decided upon. But it proceeds upon the necessity of the case, in connection with the duty of the court to decide the law, as far as practicable, in reference to the merits; which the law always presumes in favor of the judgment below, even if the contrary seems to be shown, if diminution is apparent upon the face of the transcript, and until it has been shown to be otherwise by certiorari. But there being no such presumption of merits upon the other side to suggest the ex-officio interposition of the court, and the party’s mouth being closed by his admissions, his own laches can lay no foundation for indulgence unless in some special case where, notwithstanding his right to dismiss his case after the suspension of the judgment of the court, that he might have opportunity to do so, his rights would be absolutely cut off; and then it ought to be allowed him only upon the terms of costs, equivalent to what would accrue upon the dismissal of his writ. And there might be other extraordinary cases when great delays of the administration of justice might, under peculiar circumstances, demand a departure from the rule. The provisions of our statute cited, have, we think, no relevancy to this application, because they were in the main designed not to aid a reversal in this court, but to promote affirmances; and ■such of them as have application to proceedings in this court, have no place, as it is not pretended that our proceedings are irregular. The cases cited from New York are all upon terms of cost, and in express terms are rested upon their own “special and peculiar circumstances,” and are departures from the general practice in that State, which is in accordance with ours. And it is manifest that if these special cases are much indulged, the rules of practice, to which they form exceptions, will be entirely overturned, and the stimulus to parties, designed by these rules of practice, to bring the merits of their cases before the court, in discharge of their own duties, will cease; and as a consequence, justice often delayed by the merest negligence of counsel,,in' a court where they are presumed to h ave the highest degree of skill and to exert all proper diligence.

1862671,Owen as ad. vs. Jones,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Hon. Isaac Strain, Special Judge, delivered the opinion of the. Court. This is an action of trespass on the case, against the appellant’s intestate, for damages to the cotton and corn crops of the appellee, whilst in his employ, as his overseer. Amongother evidence the plaintiffbelow, having proved the signature of Dick & Hill to be genuine, introduced theff letter, stai ting, “ There were bales of cotton, shipped us per So. Western, in bad order, a good deal of it was delivered in bulk and had to be rebaled, bales were picked, the expense of which was $ , bales were remade, the charge for ■ which was-$. Three bales were lost in this operation, and there was-loss in weight on the picked bales, &c.” To which evidence the defendant below objected, but the court overruled the objection and permitted it to go to the jury. The jury brought in a verdict for'the plaintiff for $ . Now if the other evidence, exclusive of this, were sufficient, upon which this verdict might well be sustained, although the court below manifestly erred in permitting this letter to be read as evidence to the jury, yet for this alone the verdict ought not to be disturbed. But aside from this letter, there is no evidence upon which so large an amount of damages, as contained in this-verdict, could be based or sustained: The jury, therefore, must have depended in a great measure upon this evidence in rendering this verdict. Dick & Hill were competent witnesses. Their evidence, if desired by the plaintiff below, ought to have been obtained legally, affording the defendant an opportunity to cross examine them. As to the other error assigned in the record, we think the plaintiff having fixed the commencement of the term of service of the overseer by his declaration to the 1st day of January, A. D. , and alleged “that he entered on the duties of hi.s said employment as overseer” on that day, is bound by that period, and cannot prove any injury he sustained anterior to that time. For the reason, that this action would be no bar to an action for injury sustained during a term of service anterior to this; because it could not judicially appear that any damages had been recovered for any such anterior term of service; and the declaration itself specifying the commencement of the term of service, would repel any presumption to the contrary. It is by no means true that the specification of time is, in all cases, immaterial to be proved as laid in the declaration. Where-ever time i's material, not only in matters of contract, but in matters of tort, the plaintiff is strictly bound by that time. Now in trespass, with an allegation of a continuando or diversis diebus, if the plaintiff insists upon proving repeated acts of trespass, he will not be allowed to give evidence thereof, unless committed within the time specified.” Ch. Pl. Ed. . Eastman vs. Bodfish, Story’s R. . The court therefore erred in permitting the plaintiff to give evidence of injury sustained prior to the first day of January, A.

1862635,Ryburn vs. Pryor,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Strain, Special Judge, delivered the opinion of the Court. This is an action of trover from the Hempstead Circuit Court, instituted by Pryor against Ryburn, for a negro woman and her two children. There was verdict, and judgment for the plaintiff, motion for new trial, which was overruled and Ryburn appealed to this court. For the purpose of establishing his claim to the negroes, Pryor proved in the court below, that in the year , he was married to Martha Ann Ryburn, the sister of the defendant and the daughter of Matthew Ryburn, in the State of Tennessee; and that Matthew Ryburn gave the negro woman to Pryor after the marriage: and that some time afterwards, when the negro was about to be sold for Pryor’s debts, Matthew Ryburn expressly refused to forbid the sale, saying that he had given the negro to his daughter,. Mrs. Pryor; and that Pryor held continued possession of her until or , with the exception of a year or two about , when Pryor’s father held the negro in possession. In the fall of , Matthew Ryburn removed from Tennessee to Texas, and on his way received the negro woman from Pryor and took her to Texas with him, Pryor furnishing her with a horse to ride. On the road to Texas Matthew Ryburn called her Pryor’s negro. She was hired for the year , as Pryor’s negro, with the rest of his negroes. In the year , Pryor and his father-in-law made a crop together, and the negro woman was put in as Pry- or’s property with his other negroes, and Pryor received one-third of the crop. They continued thus to live and crop together till about February, , when Matthew Ryburn, having moved away, sent his son, Montgomery Ryburn, who came with a gun and took the negro woman forcibly from Pryor. After this, Matthew Ryburn kept the negro in possession till the 1st January,. , when he executed a bill of sale for her and her child Maria, to the defendant, for $, and delivered them to him Since the negro woman has had three children, now in possession of the defendant. Pryor also introduced a witness to prove that in or , Matthew Ryburn declared more than once that the negro woman was the property of Pryor or Pryor’s wife. The competency of the evidence of this witness was objected to by Ryburn, but overruled by the court and the evidence permitted to go to the jury. Another witness stated in his depositions: “That E. L. Pryor continued to hold said negro as his property, till the year , when I as constable levied an attachment on her as E. L. Pry or’s property in favor of Sami. Pryor as will more fully appear by the transcript from the Comity Court of Montgomery county, Tennessee, hereto annexed,, marked A., which is made part of this deposition. My recollection is that at the sale of the negro above named under said attachment, Sami. Pryor, the father of plaintiff, purchased the said negro girl. He took her into possession and retained possession for some time, and sent the negro to E. L. Pryor, who had removed to the Western District of Tennessee. I think this was in or , am not certain which.” “Attached to this deposition was what purported to be a transcript containing, First: A copy of a writ of attachment, issued out of and returnable to “the County Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions,” of Montgomery county, Tennesse, dated 20th January, , commanding E. L. Pryor to be attached to answer the complaint of Sami. Pryor; Second: Copy of affidavit of indebtedness-by Sami.. Pryor, sworn to the same day before Charles Barby, a justice of the peace, who issued and signed the writ: Third, Attachment bond of Sami. Pryor and surety; Fourth: Return on the writ; showing levy, after levy of other attachments in favor of Hynes & Slaughter, upon many articles of personal property, Pryor’s interest in acres of land, “one negro girl, Julia,” and “one negro boy, Armstead.” Levy endorsed as made 20th Jan uary, . Fifth. Judgment in favor of Sami, Pryor vs. E. L. Pryor, for $, , and a memorandum that execution issued to the sheriff of Montgomery county, on the 5th of August, , but had not been returned.” Ryburn then offered to prove by a witness that his father, Matthew Ryburn, had frequently on various occasions declared in. and , that he had merely loaned the negro woman to. Pryor, and that Pryor had often re-delivered her and acknowledged the loan. The testimony was objected to and rejected by the court. Pryor objected to all testimony as to the statements of Matthew Ryburn since , offered to show that he had only loaned the negro to Pryor.. The following instructions to the jury were asked by Pryor and given by the court, and excepted to by Ryburn: 1st. That the measure of damages was the value of the property at the time of conversion, and interest thereon at six per cent. 2d. That taking a bill, of sale for the negro, assuming and claiming ownership, acting as owner and denying Pryor’s claim, constituted a conversion; and no demand was necessary. 3d. That a bill of sale is not necessary to pass the title to negroes, but they may as weU pass by delivery; and a. gift accompanied by actual deliveryjmd subsequent peaceable possession can no more be revoked i^R a sale. 4th. That as to the valujpf the woman and child, the defendant not having produced tfin, and shown them not to be of the best quality, the jury mayTairly presume the strongest against him, and make the highest value proven the measure of damages.” Among other instructions asked by Ryburn and given by the court, the three following were objected to by Pryor and excluded by the court, to which Ryburn excepted: 1st. “That if the jury-^Éfelieve from the evidence that Matthew Ryburn held and retained possession of the negro slaves sued for, as his own property and claimed them as such, the jury are bound to find for the defendant, unless there was some instrument of writing duly recorded, showing that the title was not in said Matthew Ryburn.” 2d. “That if the jury believe from the evidence that the negroes in controversy, before the alleged sale, were merely loaned by Matthew Ryburn to Pryor, temporarily, with the right to reclaim them at any time, no sale under execution or otherwise, or process against Pryor, would alter, take away, or destroy the rights of Ryburn, unless he (Ryburn), so concealed such loan as to enable Pryor, by using the property as his own for a length of time, to acquire credit on the strength of that possession of the property. But if there was no such concealment on the part of Ryburn, either actual or constructive, he might reclaim the property after such sale, to the same extent as before, whether the property remained in the hands of the purchaser at such sale, or in the hands of a subsequent purchaser.” 3d. “That the sale in Tennessee, if any such sale and subsequent gift took place, (and the jury are to determine from the evidence whether any such sale or gift took place) in no respect changed the attitude of Ryburn and Pryor, in regard to the property.” Ryburn filed his motion for new trial on the ground, 1st. The admission of irrelevant and incompetent evidence for plaintiff; 2d, The exclusion of projK- and competent evidence offered by the defendant. 3d, Giv jBPimproper instructions for the plaintiff. 4th, Refusing instrucW asked by the defendant! 5th, Verdict contrary to instructioiw 6th, Verdict contrary to law and evidence. 7th, Verdict ex(0t ve and unwarranted by proof. This motion the court over'. s <■., and Ryburn took his bill of exceptions. It appears from the bill of exception hat Ryburn filed á plea of the statute of limitations of three years, in bar of the action, which, on motion of the plaintiff was stricken from the files, to which the defendant excepted. ife- ist. The court below, in striking from the files the defendant’s plea of the statute of limitations of three years, committed no error. We think it clear the period of three years does not apply to an action of trover. This case does not come within section , of the Revised Statutes, in relation to limitations. “Trover is not an action ior taking or injuring goods or chattels. It goes on the ground of a finding and conversion.” The defendant having filed his plea of five years in bar, the plea applicable to this case, the court decided correctly, in striking the other plea of three years from the files. 2d. It appears that during the trial, the plaintiff, to prove the gift of the negro, offered the declarations of the donor made subpequent to the alleged gift, but before the donor parted with his interest to the defendant. The defendant, in order to rebut this, and to show that the negrb was merely loaned and not given, offered the declarations of the donor made during the same time. The court below received as evidence the declarations of the donor in favor of the plaintiff and rejected his declarations offered in behalf of the defendant. The principle is well established, by repeated adjudications, that although a man’s declarations are not evidence for him, they are evidence against him, andhis subsequent vendee must abide those declarations. If the plaintiff had relied alone on the evidence of the gift and delivery of the negro, without resorting on his part to the subsequent declarations of the donor, although competent for him to do so, the declarations of the donor offered by the defendant against the plaintiff ought to have been rejected. But as the plaintiff thought proper to resort to the declarations of the donor to ascertain his intention, that testimony like every other ought to be given entire. We therefore think the court erred in excluding the declarations of the donor offered by the defendant in this case. But in as much as the court did permit the defendant to prove by John W. Ryburn and Montgomery Ryburn, the subsequent declarations of the donor against the plaintiff, in substance the same as that rejected, we think the case should not be reversed for this error. Sims vs. Sanders, Harp. R. . Bailey’s R. , . 3d. Although the copy of a writ of attachment, the affidavit, attachment bond, the return on the writ showing the levy and judgment, made an exhibit in the deposition of Jenkins, are no evidence of the legality of the proceedings therein contained, or of the validity of the subsequent sale of the negro under them^ yet as facts or circumstances connected with the acts and declarations of the donor and in relation to which they took place, we think was good evidence to prove the negro was given and not loaned, and for this purpose it was competent. 4th. The four instructions asked and given on the part of the plaintiff, we consider substantially the law. The only doubt that can reasonably arise is as to the 4th instruction, the substance of which is, “that the jury might make the highest value proven the measure of damages.” This we take to be the law. 5th. The first instruction asked and excluded on the part of the defendant is clearly erroneous. An instrument in writing' has never been held necessary to pass the title to negroes. 6th. The second instruction asked and excluded on the part of the defendant was also erroneous. For the reason that the title of the lender might be divested in more ways than the “person in possession obtaining credit on the strength of the property,” as for instance, standing by and encouraging the sale of his pro* perty. The court, therefore, correctly excluded it. 7th. The 3d instruction asked and excluded on the part of the defendant was likewise erroneous. For the reason that the sale, taken in connection with the admissions and acts of the donor, was evidence of the fact that the negro had been given and not loaned. Otherwise the sale and all the proceedings connected therewith would have been irrelevant and should have been excluded. The instruction, therefore, was not applicable, and therefore properly excluded- The only remaining question to be considered is as to the amount of damages given by the jury. One witness testified that he knew the negro woman in - — -thinks she had one child, and they were worth about $, Another witness testified that he owned negroes and knew the value of them; and that the negro woman and her child in , were worth $. Another testified that in the negro wor snqn was worth $, or $, and her child $. Montgomery Ryburn testified that at the time of the trial the negro woman and her three children were worth about $. The jury, at the May term, , rendered a verdict for $. Upon this evidence we think the verdict of the jury might wel} be sustained. Judgment affirmed with costs.

1862734,Biscoe et al. vs. Tucker et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins, delivered the opinion of the Court.. The bill in this case, exhibited on the 10th of June, , represents that upon the organization of the Real Estate Bank, fifty shares of stock were awarded to Wood Tucker, for which he executed his stockbondin the sum of five thousand dollars, bearing interest atfive per cent.,together withamortgage on certainlands to secure the same, the mortgage pursuant to the charter being also conditioned for the payment of all monies which he might receive from the Bank on account of subscriptions for stock therein, and the interest on such monies according to the requisitions and regulations of the Bank. That Tucker being so entitled by the charter, had borrowed from the Bank, at two different times, $, on account of his stock credit, which with the interest remain wholly unpaid, and for this breach of the condition the bill seeks a foreclosure and sale of the mortgaged lands. It appears that Tucker executed two deeds of mortgage, one on the 10th day of September, , of the following-lands in T. , S, of R. ' W., in Jefferson county: SE qr sec. , W \ sec. , NEqr. sec. , E i sec. , in all acres. This mortgage being acknowledged, was filed for record 'on the-10th of November in the same year. On the 9th of November, , Tucker executed a second mortgage, conditioned like the first, upon a part of the foregoing lands as follows: SE qr. sec. , W sec. , in all acres. This mortgage was acknowledged on the 13th of November, ' before the Clerk of the Jefferson Circuit Court, and on the same day filed for record. On the 21st of October, , Tucker sold and conveyed to the defendant, Wright, for the consideration of $,, the two tracts of land last mentioned, being the SE qr. sec. , and the W-J- sec. , which deed being acknowledged was recorded on the 28th of the same month. The effect of Tucker’s answer, filed at October term , putting the most favorable construction upon it, was to make the issue whether he ever was legally a stockholder in the Bank in conformity with the charter, and if so, he denied that the monies in question had been borrowed on account of his stock credit; but on the contrary, he alleged that they were upon personal security, the same as ordinary loans upon paper discounted by the Bank, and therefore not embraced in or secured by the mortgage. Wright answered at the same term, disclaiming any knowledge or correct information concerning the transactions between Tucker and the Bank. He alleged that on the 10th of April,-, he had purchased at sheriff’s sale under a judgment rendered in the Pulaski Circuit Court, in favor of the Bank, on the-28th day of September, , the NE qr. sec. , and SE qr. sec. , sold as the property of Tucker, for the sum of one dollar, subject to all legal incumbrances, and that he held the sheriff’s conveyance therefor, dated on the 11th day of April, , but no such conveyance was exhibited, nor was there any proof concerning it. He claimed the benefit of his purchase from Tucker, on the 21st October, , of the SE qr. sec. , and the W-?,- sec. , insisting according to his information and belief that Tucker had good right to sell and convey, and that there was then no legal or equitable incumbrance upon the same. The cause came on to be finally heard at October term , on bill, answers, replications, exhibits and the deposition of Newton for the complainants, and that of Davies on behalf of the defendants Those depositions related to the issue in dispute, whether the moneys borrowed by Tucker were stock loans or ordinary discounts on personal security. The Circuit Court denied the relief and dismissed the bill for want of equity. It may be supposed that this decree was rendered in conformity with the previous opinion of this court, in the case of Duncan vs. Biscoe et al., Eng. , that the Real Estate Bank had only a fiduciary interest in the stock mortgages, which were designed exclusively for the indemnity of the State and the holders of the bonds, for the capital stock of the Bank, that no interest whatever in those mortgages passed by the deed of assignment, executed by the Bank to the Trustees, and that consequently they had no right to foreclose them for any purpose. That decision, likely to be attended with some unfortunate consequences, was overruled upon solemn consideration in the subsequent case of Wilson vs. Biscoe et al., Eng. , where it was holden that the assignees might well foreclose those mortgages for the failure to repay moneys borrowed from the Bank on stock credit, and sell the mortgaged lands, subject always to the ultimate and paramount lien of the State and the bondholders. In accordance with Wilson vs. Biscoe, the decree of the Jefferson Circuit Court in this case was reversed on the appeal of the Trustees, Biscoe et al. vs. Tucker et al., ib. , so far as the same question was involved, and the court then proceeding to consider another question arising out oí the peculiar facts at issue in this case, determined in view of the whole transaction, that although Tucker gave personal security, it was only cumulative, as the Bank had the right to require, See Dawson vs. R. E. Bank, Ark. , and the real intention of the parties was that Tucker obtained the loans on account of his stock credit. On the remanding of the cause to the Jefferson Circuit Court, the defendants were allowed, against the objection of the complainants, to file amended answers; in which the only material new matter was that set up by the defendant Wright, who alleged that Tucker had purchased one of the tracts in controversy, namely, the NE qr. sec. , from one John McLain, for $,, taking McLain’s bond for title, on payment of the purchase money, and which bond for title he, Tucker, had assigned to the respondent. That the purchase money not being paid to McLain, Tucker, on the 2d day of November, , conveyed the said lands to one Sterling H. Tucker, in trust among other things to pay the purchase money due to McLain, which was a lien on the land. That pursuant to such deed, the Trustee, on the 9th April, , sold and conveyed the lands mentioned in it to the respondent, wherefore he claimed to be sole proprietor of the lands, but if mistaken in that, he claimed that the original purchase money, which he had paid upon his purchase from the Trustee to satisfy McLain, should be a charge upon the lands and refunded to him. The whole cause was again put at issue, additional depositions were taken relating to Wright’s purchase under the deed of trust, and upon the second hearing the Circuit Court of Jefferson county decreed that the money borrowed by Tucker from the Bank were not stock loan's, but merely private discounts on personal security and could not attach as a lien on the lands in controversy, by virtue of the mortgage, and the complainants were not therefore entitled to the relief sought, and even if they were, Wright was entitled to a prior lien on said lands for the purchase money therefor paid to McLain, but on the grounds that the loans to Tucker were not connected with the mortgage, decreed that the bill be dismissed. There is a singular obscurity throughout the new matter set up in Wright’s amended answer. The only land he alleges that Tucker bought of McLain is the NE qr. sec. , a tract not embraced in the Bank mortgage. He professes to exhibit McLain’s bond for title to Tucker, but does not do so, and there is no proof whatever concerning it, when or upon what conditions it was executed, or when assigned to Wright, and none of the witnesses ■who depose about the sale from McLain, refer to any title bond, •or identify the tract in question. It does appear from the proofs .on the record that, on the 2d day of November, , Tucker conveyed to a Trustee the NE qr. sec. and the SE qr. sec. , with power of sale, to pay in whole, or pro rata certain debts therein recited, and among them a note to the State Bank made by Tucker with McLain, as one of the securities, and it further appears that Tucker had bought a tract of land from McLain, but what tract is no where shown, and paid for it by the proceeds of a discount in the State Bank of his own note with McLain as .security, and which note McLain was afterwards obliged to take up. And also that, on the 9th of April, , the Trustee sold the lands mentioned in the deed of trust to Wright in consideration of his paying to McLain the amount due him for said lands, and the further consideration of $ paid to the Trustee, and Wright paid the debt to McLain, by taking up his note in the State Bank for $,, and refunding to his administrator the sum of $ previously'advanced for interest and curtails, in all $,. Now, upon the case presented, the additional matter relied on by Wright in opposition to the foreclosure amounts to nothing. But supposing that Tucker had purchased one or more of the tracts of land embraced in the mortgage to the Bank, from McLain, taking an ordinary bond for title on payment of the purchase money, the claim of Wright in opposition to the mortgage would hardly be entitled to any serious consideration. Upon the hypothesis most favorable to him, the transactions were, that Tucker mortgaged to the Bank land to which he had only an equitable title, McLain having a prior lien for the unpaid purchase money. Then Tucker conveyed the land intrust with power of sale for the payment of certain debts of his, and among them that for the original purchase money. Wright bought the land under this deed of trust, the proceeds of the sale going to extinguish the debt for the purchase money, and also took from Tucker an assignment of McLain’s bond for title. If Tucker mortgaged land of which he was the equitable owner by virtue of a bond for title, his equitable title only was thereby encumbered. When he made the deed of trust he conveyed only such interest as he then had left, being what the court, in Brown vs. Morrison, Ark. , call “the equity of an equity, or in other words, a right of redemption still remaining.” If McLain had assigned to Wright a note of Tucker for the purchase money, it might have resulted that such assignment carried with it the right to subject the land to its payment as a prior incumbrance. If Wright, being the security of Tucker for the purchase money, had been forced to pay it, that being the condition only 'upon which the vendor could be required to part with the title, the security thus paying might have a claim in equity to be subrogated to the vendor’s lien. But the object and effect of the sale under the deed of trust was to pay McLain and extinguish that lien, Wright comes in as a stranger or volunteer, the same as if he had bought the land directly from Tucker on the 2d of November» , subject of course to all incumbrances. If by the terms of that purchase, Wright having so agreed, did accordingly pay off the original debt to McLain, the result would be the same as if Tucker had himself discharged that debt out of the proceeds of the land, or any other means of his. Tucker could not for any purpose, sell or assign any greater interest than he himself had in the land, and the only effect of extinguishing the prior lien, which he was legally and equitably bound to do, or cause to be done, was to let in the mortgage as the next oldest incumbrance. It is not to be inferred from onr patient examination of this cause, that there is anything in the terms of the order remanding it, Eng. , which authorized the inferior court to open it for rehearing, or for the purpose of letting in further defences without any showing of equity: more especially as it appears that the transactions relied upon by Wright in his amended answer, transpired before the filing of the bill, and of which from their nature, he must have had personal knowledge. The statute Digest, title Chancery, sec. , provides that upon the hearing and determination of appeals in chancery, the Supreme Court, if it shall reverse the decision or decree of the Circuit Court, shall make such decision, order or decree with costs, as the Circuit Court ought to have made, “which when certified to the Circuit Court shall be entered up as the decision, order or decree of said court, and shall be carried into effect in the same manner as if the decree had been made by the Circuit Court.” Whatever may have been the former practice of this court, and which, indeed, has prevailed and been acquiesced in since its organization, we must conclude that the clear and explicit language of the section quoted, makes it incumbent upon this court to render a final decree upon reversal, in all chancery causes brought here by appeal, whenever it appears that the cause was in a condition to have been finally heard and disposed of in the court below. We add this qualification because there may be instances where this court, owing to its peculiar organization, not having original jurisdiction in such cases, but authority only to hear and determine the appeal de novo upon the law and facts, just as it was heard and submitted in the court below, might think proper, and within the spirit of the statute, instead of making any final decree to remand the cause upon an issue or reference to ascertain a necessary fact, or upon some further equitable directions. But as a general if not universal rule, when a chancery cause is ripe for hearing, and is finally heard in the court below, after all the opportunities afforded for careful and mature preparation, considering also the rehearing that may be sought in that court Upon petition, and the remedial jurisdiction by bill of review, the decision of this court ought to be final and conclusive upon the case as it is presented here by the record in the appeal. It is to be presumed that the parties have brought upon the record every appropi’iate allegation and corresponding proofs essential to the determination of their rights. In chancery appeals this court does not sit, as in common law cases, for the correction of errors but for all the purposes of that appeal, as a court of chancery with authority to make such final disposition of the cause as the inferior court ought to have done. The cause has passed from the jurisdiction of that court, and no questions can come before it, or be returned to this court for revision, except such as may rarely arise out of proceedings that are had subsequent and in obedience to the mandate. When this court decided, at January term, , that the loan to Tucker was on account of his stock credit, after the lapse of that term, the decision had passed beyond its control, Ashley vs. Hyde and Goodrich, Eng. , and the question of fact, if there was before any doubt concerning it, became irrevocably settled. It would then be extraordinary if the Circuit Court possessed the power it assumed to exercise, of decreeing, after the remanding of the cause, that the loans to Tucker were exclusively upon personal security, and not connected with the mortgage. The repose and good order of society demand that there should, at some period of a cause, be an end of litigation. The verdicts of juries are none the less conclusive because they do sometimes determine a fact contrary to what may be the real truth. Upon the same principle, and no matter how injurious the consequences may be, the parties in the appellate court may be bound by the submission of a cause upon a diminished record, according to which one has affirmed and the other denied that there is error. The appellate court, with a deep sense of all the obligations resting upon it, may sometimes mistake the record, and will be liable to err in matters of law so long as men are liable to differ in opinion. But the decision in the particular case is forever the law of that case; see Porter vs. Hanly, Eng. , referring to former decisions of this court, and is conclusive not only of.those points that appear to be noticed or decided by the opinion of this court, but of every question of law or fact presented upon the record, and which was necessary to have been decided in order to enable the court to arrive at such conclusion.

On the 20th of April , a writ of fieri facias execution issued returnable to the May term following, and being levied on certain real estate of the defendant, the same was advertised to be sold. On the 23d of May, which was the first day of the term, the defendant Hanly moved to quash the execution because it bore teste more than a year and a day after the rendition of the judgment, and no intermediate execution had been sued out between that period and the issuance of the one sought to be quashed. It may be conceded, for all the purposes of this opinion, as having been made to appear that no execution was issued upon the judgment within a year and a day after its rendition. The motion to quash being overruled, the defendant excepted and appealed to this court, and upon the granting of the appeal, he entered into recognizance, the effect of which was to stay further proceedings upon the execution, then in the hands of the sheriff. According to the ancient practice which grew up and became settled at the common law, if execution was not issued within a year and a day, and kept renewed within like periods, the judgment in personal actions was presumed to be paid, and the plain ¿iff was put to his action on the judgment, or required to pursue' the remedy by scire facias afforded at a later period by statute!The issuances of execution were entered as continuances on the' roll, constituting the record of the judgment. The object of the' new action or scire facias was to give the defendant the benefit of the presumption of payment, by enabling him to plead at law' payment or release. Execution might be had after a year and a-day when the judgment had been entered with a stay of execu-tion, which repelled the presumption of payment, but otherwise; and where the judgment had not been kept alive by the issuance of execution and continuances upon the roll, an execution, issued after a year and a day, might be quashed as irregular. According to the system under which this practice originated and to which it was adapted, the judgment was not a lien, nor were lands sub-j ect to sale under execution; and when afterwards they were made subject, in a qualified manner, by being extended and set apart to the creditor, until his judgment was satisfied out of the rents- and profits, the judgment came to be considered as a lien, because of the right to issue execution, and by analogy to the lien on the chattels of the debtor, which were bound from the teste of the writ. The law presumed that the execution was an entire thing, and that it issued and bore teste upon the rendition of the judgment, and that the sheriff began immediately to execute; hence, the death of the debtor, after the supposed teste and before execution actually begun, did not stay execution against his property, in the hands of his representatives, and no scire facias was necessary in such case to revive the judgment in order to complete execution. The law contemplated diligence on the part of the creditor, and as the judgment did not bear interest as a compensation for delay, and the execution ran usually against moveables, there was good reason for indulging in the presumption in favor of the debtor, that the judgment had been satisfied where the creditor had lain passive and taken no step to have execution for a year and a day. But in this State, from its admission into the Union, a different system has prevailed, being introduced by statute, and to which the common law practice, though useful by way of illustration would be inapplicable. The judgment is a lien on lands, which equally with chattels, are absolutely subjected to sale to satisfy it. The lien on land continues for three years from the day of the rendition of the judgment, and may be revived and kept alive for like periods of three years, not depending upon the ceremony of issuing and returning executions from time to time without further action, but by scire facias sued out before the termination of the lien. The execution is a lien only upon chattels and upon lands to which the lien of the judgment does not extend, (that may be when directed to another county,) or has determined, from the time of its delivery to the proper officer to be executed. All judgments are required to be docketed and indexed, by entering abstracts of them in regular order, in bound volumes, to facilitate the actual notice which the law has made construe- tive; and judgments thus become a security for money equivalent, in many essential features, to a statute mortgage on all lands of the debtor within the county or district to which the lien attaches. So long as the lien continues, or is kept alive in accordance with the statute, it is not impaired, nor does any presumption of payment arise, so as to render the judgment inoperative, in consequence of the mere delay of the creditor in proceeding to consummate the lien by the issuance of execution. If the judgment be satisfied in whole or in part by judicial sale, the statute requires such fact to appear by the officer’s return, which must also be copied, or an abstract made of it, in an execution docket; and whether paid upon or without legal process, it is made the duty of the plaintiff, under a penalty not exceeding five hundred dollars, within a certain number of days thereafter, to enter satisfaction on the docket of judments and decrees; and on his refusal, the defendant, on application to the proper court, may cause such satisfaction to be entered. In addition to the resort to chancery, in cases where it may have jurisdiction, the statute has also provided a summary remedy by application to the judge of the court, out of which the execution issued, and upon due notice to the opposite party, to supersede or quash executions, of which the defendant can always avail himself to show any subsequent payment or release, or other matter de hors the record, whereby he would claim the benefit of any credits, or insist that the execution ought to be superseded. By the Revised Statutes of , Tille Limitations, sec. , judgments and decrees thereafter rendered are presumed to be paid and satisfied, after the expiration of ten years from their rendition, and by the act of December , repealing the 30th section referred to, the like period was adopted as a limitation of actions upon judgments! Such, in brief and comprehensive terms, and so stated only with reference to the particular case now before the court, is a summary of the statutes bearing on the question under consideration. They contain no reference to the common law practice on this subject, nor any provision indicating an adoption of it! On the contrary, the two systems are, in many important respects, so dissimilar that we must presume the legislature im tended, by those various statutory regulations in pari materia, the adoption of a system to the exclusion of so much of the common law as may be inconsistent with our own frame of laws, Digest, Title Commobt and Statute Law of England, sec. ; and it is clearly the duty of courts to give effect to such intention, more especially when an implicit adherence to the common law forms or practice might lead to consequences that could never have been contemplated by the framers of our statutes. Entertaining these views, we are led to the conclusion that the opinion in Brackney vs. Wood, Eng. . which holds that, in order for the plaintiff to have execution of his judgment, he must revive it by scire facias, unless execution has been issued within a year and a day from its rendition, and regularly continued by the issuance of execution from year to year in order to keep the judgment alive, and rebut the presumption of payment, was not well considered, and cannot be reconciled with the provisions of law in force when it was pronounced. Indeed, from the report of the case, it does not appear that the inconsistencies here adverted to, were urged upon the court or in any way noticed by the opinion. The statute repels the presumption of payment within a year and a day, and as the rights of the defendant are so carefully guarded and protected, no injustice can result to him by holding that execution upon an unsatisfied judgment may well issue at any time within ten years from its rendition. As between the plaintiff and the defendant, a sale under such execution would be good, though as against third persons, the plaintiff would lose the benefit of the lien of the judgment if omitted to be revived. The spirit of the statute would seem to require that an execution, after ten yéars from the rendition of the judgment and without any subsequent revivor, ought to be quashed, as having improvidently issued upon a dormant claim, and this without reference to whether the formality had been pursued of continuing executions within each year and a day, so that the plaintiff being put to'his remedy by action, would have an opportunity of rebutting the presumption of payment, or avoiding the statute bar, provided by the act of December, , if by any matter he might lawfully do so. But to require a revival by scire facias, after each, omission of execution for a year and a day, for the mere purpose of letting in proof of payment or release, would be foreign to the policy of the statute, and a practice expensive and vexatious to both plaintiff and defendant. The case of Davis vs. Helm, Smedes & Marsh. , relied upon by counsel in one of the cases under submission, and depending upon the same question, falls short of sustaining the position in support of which ■it is cited. The point there was, whether upon a judgment •against two or more, and one of the defendants dying, the plaintiff might have execution against his administrator without revivor, and the court decided that the statute making the judgment a lien, did not, by analogy to the common law, enable the plaintiff to complete the execution as if already begun, or dispense with the scire facias to bring in the representatives. This would be a very plain question with us, Bently vs. Cummins, Eng. , if indeed, in accordance with the administration law, the creditor would not have to be remitted for satisfaction, as against the estate of the decedent, out of the assets before the court of Probate. After the decision in Brackney vs. Wood, the General Assembly passed an act, approved January 10th, , Acts of , p. , the first section of which is as follows: “It shall and may be lawful for any party plaintiff to any judgment or decree rendered by any of the courts of this State, to issue execution thereon, at any and all times within ten years from the rendition of any judgment or decree as aforesaid, without revivor; except in case of the death of either party to any such judgment or decree.” It is argued that this statute is not retrospective in terms, and even if it was so expressed* such an operation ought not to be allowed by any judicial construction. Inasmuch as the statute is prospective for the only purpose contemplated by it, that is, the issuance of execution, it would be difficult to maintain that the application of it to judgments previously rendered, impaired any vested right of a defendant, lessened his remedies, extended the life of the judgment, or affected him in any way, save to relieve him from the burthen of costs occasioned by useless revivals. But having considered that the provisions of the act quoted, so far as they relate to judgments of a Circuit Court, are only declaratory of what the law was before, the judgment appealed from must, in any view of the case, be affirmed.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862677,The State Bank vs. McGuire,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. This suit was instituted on the 22d of March, , by the Bank against the defendants upon a promissory note for $,, purporting to have been executed by them, on the 1st of July, , in favor of the Bank, due twelve months after date, and negotiable and payable at the Branch of the Bank at Batesville. The only material enquiry arises under two of the pleas interposed by the defendants; 1st. Nil clebet sworn to, being the same in effect, under our statutory practice, as non est factum ; 2d that the note in question was given by them without any consideration whatever therefor. The history of the transaction, according to the undisputed facts appearing in the record, would seem tobe as follows: That on the 10th of February, , when the act to place the Bank of the State of Arkansas in liquidation took effect, the Bank at Batesville held five notes of William L. McGuire, amounting in the aggregate to $,, all either then due or falling due shortly after that period. Under the liquidation act passed at the session of , Daniel J. Chapman had been elected Executive Receiver, and Thomas S. Drew as Financial Receiver of the Branch at Batesville, the especial duties of the former being to turn his. attention to the situation and circumstances of the debtors to the Bank, to enquire into the sufficiency of all security offered, &c.; and of the latter to attend to the keeping of the books, accounts, notes and moneys of the Bank, to receiving the calls and interest on the debts due her, and to the making out of reports, statements, &c. And they constituted a board for the management and control of the business of the Bank or Branch under their immediate charge. There were also attorneys elected for the principal Bank and each of the branches, who were authorized, though not required to preside at the respective boards, and in case of a disagreement between the Receivers, should decide between them. The sufficiency of any security offered upon the renewal of any note was to be approved by both Receivers, and such approval entered upon the minutes of their proceedings, and if not so approved, such security should not be deemed sufficient. Acts of , p. . The debtors of the Bank were required, under penalty of forfeiting all claim to further indulgence, to come forward within ninety days after public notice, directed to be given by the respective Receivers of the principal Bank and branches, and pay all arrearages of interest and costs, and upon doing so were privileged to renew their notes for one year by giving satisfactory security, to be approved by the Receivers, and paying interest at seven per cent, in advance, and as such renewal notes became due, the subsequent calls upon them were to be so regulated as that the whole debt should be called in within ten years in regular annual calls. Ib. p. . Various persons were securities of McGuire upon the five notes of his referred to, Chapman, the Executive Receiver, being on one of them. On or about the 1st of July, , McGuire offered to the Receivers the large note here sued upon, in consolidation of his five notes, the securities upon it being Edwin R. McGuire and Thomas Hughes, who were also securities upon some of the other notes. The arrears of interest on the old notes over due, and discount upon the new one, amounted to $ , the curtail to be paid under the liquidation act was $, making in all $, , which W. L. McGuire had to pay in cash in order for his notes to be renewed as proposed. We may anticipate here the material enquiry of fact in the case for-the jury to determine, which was, whether the new note for $, was accepted in substitution for the old ones, by way of renewal, and if so, it would operate to discharge the old notes as a payment of them, the transaction being the same in effect, as if the debtor, according to Bank usage, obtaining a new dis-. count, had applied the proceeds of it for that purpose. And a fair test of this would be to enquire whether in case the Bank had sued the principal and securities upon the old notes, they could Jraim sustained a plea of payment upon the same state of proof as to the acceptanceof the consolidated note in rene w.al. Because,, so far as the principal debtor is concerned, it would not be possible in law that he should be liable upon two different sets of notes or securities ofequal grade for the payment of the same debt; but oneorthe otherofthem must be without consideration, no new or further consideration appearing, nor anything from which it could be inferred that the latter note was intended to be collateral to the former. The result would be the same if according to the shape of the transaction, the old note had been discharged by a release or any valid agreement in the nature of one, or satisfied by an accord executed. The deposition of Drew, taken in Louisiana, in August, , makes out the case fully in favor of the Bank. He goes into a detail of the whole matter and states that his recollection has been refreshed by an inspection of the books of the Batesville branch, made by him in , at Little Rock (where they had been removed pursuant to the act of January 9th, , Acts of , p. , withdrawing the branches and concentrating the assets and papers of the Bank at Little Rock,) and that it is more distinct, from the fact that the debt of McGuire was perhaps the, largest due by any one individual to the Batesville branch. His version of the transaction is that at the time of offering the new note, on 1st of July, , W. L. McGuire deposited with him $,, towards the cash payment required to be made, and McGuire being unable to raise any more money, the following arrangement was agreed upon and closed between him and witness, Drew, on the 29th of August, , the same being entered on the books of the branch Bank. Among the five old notes of McGuire was one for $. A credit of $ was entered upon this note, so as to reduce it to $, the amount of cash for which McGuire was short on the proposed renewal, and this note thus reduced, was retained as security for that cash balance. The new note for $,- was then passed and acceptedin renewal ofthe other four notes of McGuire and his various securities. And at the trial the Bank produced these four notes cancelled, and the fifth note for $ unpaid and having a credit endorsed of $, as stated by Drew. He deposes that the Receivers at the Batesville branch, being entirely satisfied with the sufficiency of the securities on the note for $,, and with the note itself then offered, received, accepted and approved the same, and he thinks it was properly entered on the books of the Bank, and thenceforward held as the note of the Bank. The substance of his deposition may be expressed in his own language, that “said note was received and accepted in renewal of the four notes before mentioned, on which W. L. McGuire was principal, and those four notes were extinguished, discharged and cancelled, and no longer kept on the books of the Bank or considered as assets.” Magruder, who succeeded Drew, as Financial Receiver, in October, , testified that the new note here sued upon and the one for $ with the credit of $ on it, were turned over to him by Drew as assets, and he received them as such, not passing upon or questioning the sufficiency of the security, which he supposed to be good, and so, on going out of office-, he turned over the notes in question to his successor. He had no recollection of ever before seeing the four cancelled notes that were produced on the trial. On the other hand, Chapman, who had been Executive Receiver until the close of the year , testified that about the time as stated by Drew, McGuire had offered the consolidated note for renewal of his indebtedness, and paid $, leaving some $ to be paid in money. That while he was in office the new note had never been put to a vote of the board, or approved by him; that he considered it doubtful whether the securities were sufficient, andhe so advised the Financial Receiver, and he would not approve it, because the old notes of McGuire were well secured, and the parties to the renewal note offered, were liable to the Bank as securities on other notes, and besides being a security himself on one of the old notes to the amount of $,, he wanted further and undoubted security, as a matter of personal delicacy, before he would assent to any arrangement which would have the effect to discharge himself. He thinks that while he was in office the pote was entered on the offering book for renewal, but never was passed upon the minutes or ledger, as having been approved by the board. The circumstance that the officers of the Bank retained possession of both sets of notes, would not be important either way, as it was in proof that it was not customary for the debtors of the Batesville branch to take out their notes when paid or canceled. The defendants produced two letters from Drew, while he was-Financial Receiver, addressed to W. L. McGuire, one of them; dated August 14th, , more than a year after the note in-question had been offered for renewal, in which he writes, “The payment you made to the Bank on the 29th of August last, of"" $,, lacked $ of paying the calls and interest on your several notes that were intended to be consolidated into one. This-note still awaits your further payment of that balance before it can be posted, which I am now anxious to do, and indeed it will be necessary, before your note passes and the others can be canceled.” And he concludes, “It may possibly require one or two more names on the large note, as it embraces all your liabilities without several of your endorsers on the old notes.” The second letter accompanies a statement of the amount required for renewal, and is without date, but in it he says, “I am about to retire from office in a few days, and until you pay the-above balance of $, shall be unable to apply the above pay] ment to your credit in due form. It has been suffered to remain unacted upon in consequence of a knowledge that you had claims against the Bank for fees as sheriff, and supposing they would be made out and broughtin as early as convenience wouldpermit.” And adding,'‘As neither of your securities have renewed their own notes, the Receivers will expect an additional name on your note as it is large.” Finally, it was proved on behalf of the defendants, by Ring-gold, the former Cashier of the branch at Batesville, and by Magruder who had been also a clerk in the Bank at Little Rock,that the marks of the canceling hammer on the four old notes produced at the trial, were those of the canceling hammer of the principal Bank, and were not made by that of the Batesville branch, the impressions being distinguishable. So that the actual cancellation could not hav’e been made at Batesville, but must have been done at Little Rock, as late as , after the branches were called in. Now, it is true that, under the issues the burthen of proof was upon the defendants, and it may be possible that within the few days before Drew went out of office, McGuire may have come in, and by some means, though no where explained, perfected his renewal so long deferred; and though, if so allowed, it might not have been in accordance with the liquidation act. But without further comment, and laying aside the circumstance of the cancellation, as being more curious than important, the two letters to McGuire, written by Drew while the transactions were recent, are so inconsistent with his statement's made nine years afterwards, as to raise a violent presumption, that he was mistaken in his recollection of every material fact touching the pinch of the case; and this conclusion appears to be so irresistible that the jury were warranted in disregarding his entire deposition. But for the earnestness with which this cause has been pressed in argument, it might have been briefly disposed of as an ordinary case where a jury have passed upon a conflict of testimony, and after the refusal of the court below, in the exercise of its sound discretion to set aside the verdict upon the motion for new trial made on behalf of the Bank, it ought not to be disturbed by the appellate court. We may concede the legal propositions contended for by the attorney representing the plaintiff in this court — that according to the authorities cited, there may be instances where the breach of the charter of the Bank in making a contract, cannot be set up as a defence in an action on such contract, as, for example, where a director becomes principal or endorser to an amount prohibited by the charter. So the omission of the Financial Receiver to keep a record or minutes of the proceedings of the board in the approval of new notes, and the sufficiency of the security offered, would not vitiate a renewal in fact made, that part of the liquidation act being directory. And equally good law, that a corporation may by her acts subsequently adopt or ratify the contract of her officer or agent not under seal or made without authority, so as to make it binding on the corporation or confer a corresponding right of action in her favor upon it. But in such case it must be assumed that there was a contract made, not a pending negotiation, but an agreement executed. The point here is, whether the offer of renewal ever was perfected, so as to take effect as a contract — whether Drew himself, as an officer of the Bank, either in accordance with the liquidation act or in violation of it, ever did accept the renewal note, or approve the security. The jury must have concluded that he did not. Some of the instructions given on motion of the defendants are certainly objectionable, as argued for the plaintiff; because two of them are mere statements of legal propositions, not purporting to apply to any supposed state of case made by the evidence. For instance, the last instruction is as follows, “A contract is an agreement between two or more persons founded upon a sufficient consideration to do or not to do a particular thing, and the very life of a contract depends upon its mutuality between the parties to be affected.” This mode of charging juries ought to be strongly condemned. Nisi ptius attempts at legal definitions are apt to be faulty, and though good law as mere abstract propositions, they are in nine cases out of ten calculated to confuse or mislead a jury. The second instruction, -“That where a witness has testified falsely to any one material ¡fact, it throws a suspicion upon his whole evidence and such evidence should be disregarded unless corroborated by other testimony,” is even more objectionable because it assumes as true or proven the state of fact -upon which it is predicated. As the practice does not prevail in this State forjudges to give a regular connected charge, we have to reiterate the views expressed in Floyd vs. Ricks, at July term, , that without regard to any -set form or phraseology, every instruction asked for should be hypothetical, that is, predicated upon the supposition that the j ury find certain facts .to be proved or disproved, then the legal consequence resulting therefrom is one way or the other according as the law is claimed by either party, so that the jury hav ing to pass upon mixed questions of law and fact may shape their verdict according to the judge’s opinion of the law. Where juries choose to find a special verdict, they devolve upon the court, where it ought to rest, the responsibility of deciding the law. When the judge charges a jury in anticipation of the general verdict, the only difference is, that he undertakes to tell them in advance, what the law would be in case they should return any given state of facts by a special verdict. And yet the court is placed in the embarrassing position of refusing to award a new trial because upon the whole record, we are not prepared to say that the motion for new trial ought to have been granted in the court below, and we do not feel safe in presuming that another jury would, or ought to find differently. And moreover the court below gave all the instructions asked for on behalf of the plaintiff, and which were carefully and elaborately framed so as to present the case to the jury in the most favorable aspect for a recovery. There being no other questions requiring a serious consideration the judgment will be affirmed.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862686,Cossart vs. The State,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins, delivered the opinion of the Court.- • Pending the trial of a criminal prosecution in the Clark Circuit Court, the present appellant, Cossart, being introduced and sworn as a witness on the part of the State, refused to answer a certain question propounded to him, relative to the issue in the case then progressing; for the reason, as he stated to the court, that his answer thereto would criminate himself and subject him to an indictment. The court directed Cossart to answer the question, and upon his refusal to do so, adjudged him in contempt and ordered that he be fined in the sum of one dollar; for which, together with the costs of that proceeding, judgment was rendered in favor of the State. Cossart took a bill of exceptions, and prayed an appeal to this court, which was granted. The question thus sought to be presented for the adjudication of this court, is no doubt the same decided in the case of The State vs. Quarles, Ark. , sustaining the .constitutionality of the statute, which enacts that, where two or more persons are concerned in the commission of any crime or misdemeanor, either of them may be sworn as a witness in relation to the same, but the testimony given by such witness, shall in no instance be used against him in any criminal prosecution for the same of-fence; and on the supposition that it devolved upon the proposed witness to represent, as part of the reason assigned for his refusal, that his answer to the question might tend to criminate himself or subject him to a prosecution for some other offence or criminal act, distinct from the one for which the prosecution was-pending, and to which the question related, we might not hesitate to hold, in accordance with that decision, that the provision of the constitution to the effect that, in all criminal prosecutions,, the accused shall not be compelled to give evidence against himself, was designed for the protection of the-accused, not as immunity for crime; and to tbe extent that the statute referred to could, afford such protection to a witness, it was no invasion of his right to be exempt from self accusation touching the same crime or misdemeanor about which he is called to testify. However delicate the duty of enforcing that statute may sometimes be, where the compulsory evidence would relate to a capital of-fence, or a lesser grade of.'felony, not yet barred, as against the witness, by limitation of time, we might, if a proper case were presented on this record, be again required to express the opinion that the law may be so cautiously administered as to sub-serve the ends of public justice, without violating, the spirit of the constitution. But the enquiry is, whether a person, who may think himself aggrieved by a proceeding against him in the inferior court for contempt, can obtain any redress in this court, by appeal or writ of error. As uniformly held, the appeal provided for by statute in common law and criminal cases, is cumulative to the remedy by writ of error, and the rules governing them are the same; so that unless a writ of error will lie to an order punishing as for contempt, there would be no authority for entertaining an appeal in such a case. We do not propose to go into any elaborate examination of this subject. We are persuaded that the statute, Digest, Title, Ckimistal Pkoceedings, sec. , et seq. allowing appeals and writs of error in criminal cases, applies to prosecutions by indictment or presentment, and was not designed to. extend, nor does it in terms, to summary convictions for contempt of court, which, though in the nature of criminal proceedings, are not public prosecutions for any criminal charge, which an accused can only be put to answer by indictment, presentment or' impeachment, and for the trial of which a jury may be demanded. The power of punishing summarily and upon its own motion contempts offered to its dignity and lawful authority, is one inherent in every court of judicature. The offence is against the court itself; and if the tribunal have no power to punish in such case, in order to protect itself against insult, it becomes contemptible, and powerless also in fulfilment of its important and responsible duties for the public good. It is no argument that the power is arbitrary, though indeed settled by precedents or' limited by them as rules for the future guidance of the courts. While experience proves that the discretion, however arbitrary,, has never been liable to any serious abuse, it would be a sufficient answer to say that the power is a necessary one and must-be lodged somewhere. And it is properly confided to the tribunal against whose authority or dignity the offence is committed. One court ought not, indeed cannot undertake to judge of a contempt committed against another court. In a great variety of instances the demeanor punished as contemptuous, if examinable elsewhere, might become intangible or inappreciable. If a contumacious witness, juror, party litigant, or counsel, be entitled to an appeal or writ of error, he could also claim the full benefit of a supersedeas or stay of execution of the sentence, by complying with the statute in such cases, and thereby effectually check the machinery of the court in its operation, and frustrate-the wholesome administration of the law. The statutory regulation of the writ of habeas corpus, Digest, ch. , Art. , sec. , and the statute itself; ib. ch. , which would seem to limit, while it purports to confer the power of punishing for contempts, are inconsistent with the idea that the hand of the court may be stayed' in the act of exercising its authority, and the pending question of contempt between the court and the party concerned, adjourned on appeal or error into another forum. At the common law no writ of error lay in such case; nor would a prisoner for contempt be released on habeas corpus, by a different court. Ld. Mayor of London’s case, Wilson . Ex parte, Kearney, Wheaton, . Ex parte, Tobias Watkins, Peters, . Yate’s case, John. . And the decisions in the United States are to the same effect, that there can be no appeal or writ of error. Johnson vs. The Commonwealth, Bibb, . The State vs. Tipton, Blackford, . See also The State vs. Woodfin, Iredell, . Martin’s case, Yerger . In Hummell’s case, Watts, , the court intimated that, by reason of its superintending jurisdiction, it would revise the proceedings of inferior courts in contempt cases by certiorari. In Bickley vs. The Commonwealth, J. J. Marshall, , the court, not intending as they said, to disturb the authority of the opinion of Ch. J. Bibb, in Johnston’s case, yet departed from it by reversing upon a writ of error, a sentence of imprisonment for contempt, because the inferior court had exceeded its authority. And while concurring in the result of the case of Neil vs. The State, Eng. , where the sentence of the Circuit Court striking an attorney from the roll for six months, for an out door charge against the judge personally and not officially, the attorney disclaiming any insult or contempt to the court, was set aside on error, it is sufficient to say of it on this point, that the question, whether such was the proper mode of seeking redress, does not appear to have been raised or considered. Though by not indicating what remedies would be available, in the variety of cases where it might be alleged that the inferior court, in punishing for contempt, had exceeded its lawful authority or jurisdiction, it is not to be understood that in such cases there can be no remedy; yet we are clear in the opinion that according to existing law, there is none by writ of error or appeal.

1862712,Bunch vs. The State,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. The appellant was' attached for contempt in failing to attend •the Desha Circuit Court, when duly summoned as a witness in certain State prosecutions, and which in consequence of his absence were nol. prossed by the attorney for the State; and being interrogated failed to purge himself, to the satisfaction of the court, of the alleged contempt. The court ordered him to be fined in the sum of fifty dollars and to stand committed until the fine and costs be paid, &c. He took a bill of exceptions, prayed an appeal and entered into recognizance before the court below for stay of execution. The disposition manifested by the Circuit Court, to cause to be stated upon the record, fairly and truly, for the protection of the person adjudged to be in contempt, the grounds and reasons for the same, and the substance of which ought to be set forth in the warrant of commitment, is every way commendable. But as held in Cossart vs. The State, at this term, the appeal and supersedeas, if allowable, would virtually set at naught the power óf a Circuit Court to punish summarily for contempt in any case.

1862628,McDaniel vs. Coleman,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Waticins delivered the opinion of the Court! Coleman applied to the White Circuit Court for a rule upon McDaniel to show cause why a mandamus should not be awarded to compel him to issue execution upon a judgment which, the petitioner alleged, he had obtained against one Walter, on the trial had before McDaniel, as a justice of the peace, of a suit in which the petitioner was plaintiff and Walker was defendant, on the 6th day of September, , to which day the summons issued by the justice in that suit and which had been duly served on Walker was returnable. The magistrate, in his response, admitting that he had rendered such judgment, as set forth in the alternative writ, further stated that afterwards and on'the same day the judgment was rendered, an application was made to him by Walker’s counsel, to set it aside and grant a new trial, because an offset, offered to be filed on the part of Walker, had been improperly ruled out at the trial in question; and he, the respondent, being satisfied that he had erred in rejecting the offset, did set aside and vacate that judgment and grant a new trial, of which new trial the petitioner, Coleman, had notice. That upon a second hearing of the case, a judgment was rendered against Coleman, which stands in full force upon the respondent’s docket as a justice of the peace, unsatisfied and unappealed from; and there being no longer any such judgment as that alleged by the petitioner, the respondent submits whether he can or ought to issue execution upon it. Upon the hearing the court below adjudged that a peremptory mandamus issue. This case presents a question of no little interest to the numerous class of suitors before magistrate’s courts,- that is, whether a justice of the peace can set aside a judgment and grant a new trial. And it is one of some difficulty; because justices of the peace being judicial officers, it would seem that so much discretion ought to be confided to them, as would enable them to correct their own erroneous judgments, by granting anew trial. But the Legislature has not thought proper to provide for such remedy, and the power cannot be inferred as one inseparable from a court of such inferior and limited jurisdiction. While the General Assembly could not deprive justices of the peace of any part of the jurisdiction given to them by the constitution, or even so legislate as to clog or impair it, or prevent its exercise by omitting to legislate Moore vs. Woodruff, Ark. , there can be as little doubt that the mode and manner of exercising their jurisdiction may be controlled and regulated by law. The various provisions of the statute concerning justices of the peace and regulating the proceedings in suits before them, are so minute and specific, as by intendment to exclude the power of granting new trials in contested cases, to which no allusion is made. A justice of the peace may adjourn causes from day to day until the business qn his docket is disposed of, Digest, Title, Justices of the Pf.ace, sec. ; may adjourn a case, ifhe deems it necessary, not exceeding thirty days, ib. sec. ; may grant continuances for cause shown on the application of either party not exceeding sixty days, ib. sec. ; may set aside a judgment of non-suit or by default, if applied for within fifteen days; ib. sec. , and then the justice is required to make out and cause to be served, in the same manner as a summons, a notice to the opposite part¿ of the time and place fixed for the new trial, ib. sec. . Either party aggrieved by the judgment of a justice may appeal within thirty days (except from a judgment of non-suit, or by default, where no application is made within fifteen days to set it aside) to the Circuit Court, where the trial is de novo upon the facts and merits, ib. see. , et seq., whereby the party aggrieved is relieved from all apprehension of irreparable injury by means of an unjust and erroneous decision, and if the right of appeal be lost without any fault of the party, or is attempted to be taken away by the legislature, the supervising controll of the superior courts may be exercised in some other appropriate mode. Leaving out of view any case where the new trial might be granted by consent of parties, or where the appearance to the merits by both parties at the new trial might amount to a submission to the jurisdiction — there being no limitations or restrictions upon the granting new trials by justices of the peace, where there has been a trial and judgment, and no power conferred except in the cases specified of judgments of non suit or by default, the assumption of such .a power in all cases would be productive of the utmost confusion and uncertainty and might lead to gross abuses. The number of new trials, the causes for which they should be granted, the kind of notice to the opposite party, the time beyond which the magistrate should cease to have contrail over judgments rendered by him, would, as the law now stands, be left to the discretion of a vast number of inferior courts, only quasi courts of record, having no clerk, no seal, no perpetual succession or continuance of office, and without terms of fixed and limited duration. In Kentucky and Indiana it seems that justices of the peace may grant new trials, Hotten vs. Greenwell, Dana , where certain, limitations upon the power are prescribed. Robideau vs. Ewing, Blackfield, , where it appears to be expressly allow-, ed by statute; and in that State justices’ courts are courts of record. Hooker vs. The State, ib. . And in Kentucky justices of the peace by statute have powers wholly unknown to our laws. Breckenridge vs. Coleman, B. Monroe, , while in New York, and some other States, they are treated as jurisdictions even more inferior and limited than with us. But in Missouri, under a system very similar to ours, the power of justices to grant new trials not being conferred by statute, is utterly denied. Cason vs. Tate, Missouri, , referring to Downing vs. Gainer, ib. , and Rutherford vs. Winn, ib. . So in Iowa, Helmich vs. Johnson, Morris . Our opinion is that if Walker, the defendant in the suit before the justice, was aggrieved by the decision there, his appropriate remedy was by appeal, and that all the proceedings of the-justice subsequent to the rendition of the first judgment mentioned in the pleadings were unauthorized by law. This conclusion is not predicated upon any want of capacity-in justices of the peace to set aside the verdicts of juries and grant new trials in causes pending before them, but upon the distinct ground that the Legislature, having the power to regulate the exercise of their jurisdiction, intended, according to what seems to be the proper construction- of the statutes- on the subject, the trial de novo upon appeal as a substitute for the granting of new trials by the justices themselves.

1862705,Strawn vs. The State,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court, The appellant was indicted under the statute for maiming one Jesse Edwards, the offence being a felony: The same statute, Digest, Title, Criminal Law. Part , Art. , Sec. , enacts “that if persons fight by mutual agreement, and one of them be maimed, it shall not be deemed maiming within the meaning of this act; but the parties shall be punished by fine and imprisonment as fin-an aggravated affray; which fine shall not exceedone thousand dollars, and the imprisonment shall not exceed one year, at the discretion of the court.” On the trial the verdict was, “We the jury, do find the within named John Strawn, not guilty, as charged in the within indictment, but find that he and the within named Jesse Edwards fought by mutual agreement. By authority of the statute, Digest, Title, Criminal Proceedings, sec. , the court assessed the punishment to fifty dollars fine and imprisonment for one hour, and passed sentence accordingly. The prisoner moved in arrest of judgment, because the verdict, which acquitted him of the offence charged in the indictment, failed to show that he was guilty of any minor offence. Certainly it might have been proper for the verdict to have stated more explicitly that the accused was not guilty, as charged, of the offence of maiming, but that he and Edwards fought by mutual agreement, whereby the latter was maimed. But looking at the indictment, the statute and the verdict as returned, the conclusion is reasonable, if not unavoidable, that such was the meaning and intention of the jury; and although the verdict does not state, in express terms, that Edwards was maimed, it will bear that construction, and was therefore sufficient to warrant the sentence. Under the existing law, Revised Statutes, Title, Criminal Jurisprudence, Division , Art. . See Eason vs. The State, Eng. , an accused convicted of an assault merely, with intent to commit certain felonies, including mayhem, might have been subjected to an equally severe punishment by fine and imprisonment; and so for an aggravated assault: and for a simple assault, not attended with battery, the fine may be in any sum not exceeding one hundred dollars. Whatever might be the degree of strictness required in convictions for felony, we are not disposed to apply it to misdemeanors after verdict, and the present case is not stronger than that of McBride vs. The State, Eng. . The verdict here was not a special one, which referring the law to the court, must state all the facts essential to a conviction; as for example, that the act supposed to constitute the felony, was done within the county, but was a general one, finding conclusions of law and fact, as will appear from the case of The Commonwealth vs. Call, Pick, , cited for the appellant. The verdict does indeed specially acquit the prisoner of the particular offence with which he is charged, but such acquittal, so far from vitiating the verdict, or precluding the jury from proceeding to find the lesser offence, in cases where it is allowable to do so, Cameron vs. The State, Ark. , it is the proper form of returning the verdict in such cases. Chitty Crim. Law, . It is argued here for the appellant that as the jury found the accused guilty of a misdemeanor only, the verdict should have stated that such offence was committed-within a year previous to the finding of the indictment; else having pleaded to an indictment for a felony, the limitation of which is three years, he might have been illegally convicted of a misdemeanor, which for aught that appears, was barred by lapse of time. Though the better opinion would seem to be that where an averment in an indictment as to time is not material, The People vs. Santvoord, Cowen, , unless indeed the averment be of an impossible date, it is not required to be proved as laid, yet any question that might arise under the statute, whether an indictment ought not to be quashed, or the judgment upon it arrested, where upon the face of the indictment, the offence of which the prisoner may be convicted appears to be barred, is obviated in this case, because here the offence is charged to have been committed within a year previous to the first finding of the indictment. The language of the statute is, “No person shall be tried, prosecuted and punished for any offence less than felony, unless the indictment be found within one year after the commission of the offence.”. Our understanding is, that the uniform construction of the phraseology quoted has been, that in order to make out the offence the State is required to prove affirmatively, to the satisfaction of the jury, upon the issue to the plea of hot guilty, that the alleged misdemeanor was committed within a year previous to the finding of the indictment. Stevens vs. The State, Ark. . Consequently, where the indictment alleging an offence within the year is good on its face, if the proof at the trial discloses an offence committed at some anterior time, the only way in which the prisoner can avail himself of the objection is, to bring it upon the •record by exceptions; or it might be ground of motion for new trial; but would not be available in arrest of judgment.

1862730,Jester et al. vs. The State,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins, delivered the opinion of the Court. The indictment, preferred at the February term, , of the Hot Spring Circuit Court, charged that the appellants, on the tenth day of March, A. D. , at&c., bet a certain sum of money at an unlawful game at cards called draw pocre, then and there played by them together. Asecond count alleged the game played to be called pocre. On the trial the State proved that, at the August term , an indictment which, leaving out of view any variance between them, the jury were authorized to .infer was for the same offence, was preferred against Jester, Ready, Morehead and one Cyrus A. Hale, charging that the games in question were played by those four persons together, on the tenth day of March, . That Hale, having pleaded guilty to that indictment at the February term, , it was then, on motion of the attorney for the State, quashed as to the other defendants, Jester, Ready and Morehead. The parol testimony on the trial conduced to prove that during the month of January, , in the county of Hot Spring, these defendants had bet money upon a game at cards called pocre, then and there played by them together with Hale and one Joshua F. Morris,, and that the witnesses for the prosecution had so testified before the grand jury, at each term of the court when the respective indictments were found. The defendants asked the court to instruct the jury, that in order to convict upon an indictment for betting at cards, under the 8th section of the statute against gaming, it is necessary -as part of the description of the offence, to set out the names of the persons by whom the game was played, if known to the grand jury, apd that the proof should correspond with the allegations in that respect. The refusal of the court to give this instruction and the omission to charge the jury in any manner equivalent to it, was clearly erroneous, according to the opinions of this court in Drew vs. The State, Eng. . Parrott vs. The State, ib: . Moffat vs. The State, ib. . Stith vs. The State, Ark. , and Johnson vs. The State, ib. . An objection was also taken and reserved to the sufficiency and legal effect of the record evidence adduced to prove the pendency of the former indictment, in order to displace the operation of the statute bar, supposed to appear on the face of the second indictment, which charged the offence to have been committed more than a year previous to the time when it was preferred, And it was further objected that the State could not avail herself for this purpose of the record of an indictment or prosecutipp pending and quashed at her own instance. The provision of the statute, Digest, Title, Criminal Proceedings, sec. , is “When any indictment or prosecution shall be quashed, set aside or reversed, the time during which the same was pending, shall not be computed as part of the time of the limitation prescribed for the offence.” As the first indictment could only have been quashed by the decision of the court, the presumption is, that it was done, though on motion of the attorney for the State, for sufficient cause, in the exercise of judicial discretion, and not capriciously, or with any design to harrass the accused, so that, although the quashal might operate as a hardship, we cannot presume they yvere injured by it, because such a proceeding is a .contingency provided for by the statute and liable to occur in the administration of justice. Conceding that it was necessary for the State to prove that the offence, no matter when alleged to have been committed, was in fact committed within a year previous to the finding of the indictment, (Strawn vs. The State, decided at the present term), or to displace the bar by showing, in accordance with the statute the pendency and quashal of a former prosecution for the same offence, we might incline to the opinion, by parity of reasoning with the case of The State Bank vs. Gray, Eng. , and The State Bank vs. Roddy, ib. , that the record of a former indictment against four persons might be admissible for that purpose on the trial of a subsequent indictment against any one or more of the same persons, and who might be separately indicted, provided the offence charged appeared to be in other respects the same, But the difficulty here is, and it is, in a different aspect, the same question presented by the motion to instruct the jury, that the second indictment charges the games to have been played by three persons, (the present appellants) while the record adduced in evidence, disclosed by the former indictment, a charge against them for betting at games played by four persons — which being a distinct offence there was a material variance, for which the record should have been excluded. If the second indictment had charged that these defendants bet at a game played by them together with Hale, the question might have been analogous to The State Bank vs. Gray, and same vs. Roddy, where the cause of action was the same, though all the defendants in the first suit were not embraced in the second. For these errors the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to grant the motion of the defendants for a new trial, and that the cause be further proceeded in according to law and not inconsistent with this opinion.-",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862685,Austin vs. The State,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. The appellant was indicted, tried, convicted and sentenced to death in the Independence Circuit Court for the murder of Hiram Payne, a white man. He appealed to this court, and his senténcé having been respited by the Circuit Court, under the provisions of the statute, a sufficient time to allow him to make an application to a judge of this court for a suspension of his execution until his appeal could be heard here, that order was made upon an inspection of a transcript of the record and proceedings in accordance with his prayer. From the bills of exceptions it appears that, on the day before the killing, the appellant and his master, Benjamin Watson,had a conversation, in which the slave talked improperly to his master,' and that at night when he returned from ploughing, he brought, a club in with him. That after supper he sat out upon the yard fence with the same in his hand, and also picked up another stick, which he took to his quarters and set up at the door, carrying the first named stick into the house. That in the course of the evening, and after supper, his master went into a room where the-school boys and hirelings were, whereupon the appellant left his own room and went to the chimney corner of the dwelling house. That about the middle of the night the appellant walked out into the yard carrying a fire torch, and the stick that he had brought from the field, in his hand. Upon returning to his quarters he told his wife they were going to take him, but that he would not be taken by bis master or any body else, and that he would knock the first man down that came into the room. ■ The next morning, the appellant went to mill and returned, and then bundled up his clothes and took them away. He then got some tubs, as he was ordered to do, and went to the Woods for some hoop poles, as he was ordered to do by a witness, who was doing some work for Watson, the master, and needed the hoop poles for the work in progress. It would seem thats about this period of time, Mrs. Watson, the wife of the master, had sent a message to her husband, who was at the school house, to the effect that the appellant had run away, and it appearing that while Watson, the master, was on the way from the school house to his dwelling, whither he was going in consequence of receiving such a message from his wife, he met the appellant coming from the woods with some hoop poles and an axe in his hands. It appears that then “Watson and others advanced towards the (appellant) at the request of Watson, and for the purpose, as expressed by Mr. Watson of correcting” him. Who these others were and how they happened to be with Watson does not appear. It appears, however, that when Watson and these others approached to the appellant, that he retreated, but that they overlook him in the road and ordered him to lay down his axe, and he refused, and said that he would not be w’hipped by Watson, or any body else, and that he would kill the first man that attempted to take him, and that he then walked on, and Watson and the men after him. In a short time he stopped again and was conversing with Watson, but what was said does not appear. At this point of time “Hiram Payne, the slain, walked rapidly by the witness, from behind the witness, being behind the boy and the company, having in his hands a piece of pine plank. That Payne, the deceased, walked directly up to Watson and Austin, the appellant, and drew his stick upon Austin. That Austin stood with his axe drawn as Payne drew his stick upon Austin. That Austin warded off the blow of Payne with his left arm, and with his right struck Payne with the axe. That Payne was hit with the whole edge of the axe on his head, the cut penetrating to the brain, and that Payne died the Saturday afterwards.” Upon the trial so much of the evidence was objected to as related to matters that transpired the day before the homipide, upon the ground of its disconnection with that principal fact, and irreleyan cy to the issue. It is certainly true as a general rule, both in civil and criminal cases, that the evidence must be confined to the point in issue; and in criminal cases there is perhaps a greater necessity, if possible, than in civil proceedings to enforce the rule: but in neither class of cases does this rule exclude all evidence that does not bear directly upon the issue; on the contrary, all evidence is admissible which tends to prove it, and no facts are forbidden to be shown, except such as are incapable of affording any reasonable presumption or inference in elucidation of the matters involved in the issue. In this case the line of defence taken, and which the State had the right to anticipate, was that the homicide amounted to no more than manslaughter. The presen ce or absence of malice was therefore an essential matter of enquiry. To establish it the State was not bound to rely exclusively upon the malice that the law presumes from the killing, and the evidences of it which were otherwise shown by the circuriistances at the point of time when the killing occurred, but had the right to add any other evidence, as former grudges, former threats, previous lying in wait, cumulative of the former, and • thus effectually to repel any inferences that might be drawn in favor of the defence from the circumstances that transpired at the time of the killing. In like manner, antecedent facts and circumstances, from which any reasonable presumption could arise, or inference be drawn, that the course of conduct pursued by the prisoner at the time of the killing had been previously premeditated and resolved upon by him, in reference to a probable effort to bring him back into perfect subordination to the lawful authority of his master, although without any reference to the particular individual slain, tended at once, not only to elucidate the intention of the slave at the’time of striking the fatal blow, but the state and condition of his heart, both as to evil design in general, and in being resolved, in pursuance of the dictates of such wicked, depraved and malignant evil design in general, to do the particular, unlawful act of resisting the rightful authority of his master at all hazards, including that of taking human life in general, regardless of social duty and without respect to persons. Such a resolye, prompted by the dictates of such a heart, could not be otherwise, than essentially malicious, and if in being acted out, human life was taken, although under circumstances which, disconnected with such resolve, might lay grounds for presumptions that the slayer was actuated by a design to save his own life, or was prompted by circumstances transpiring at the time strongly calculated to excite the passions of terror and resentment, it could not be otherwise than a legitimate point of enquiry by the jury, whether or not the homicide had been really superinduced by the former, although apparently by the latter, to the end that the presumption in favor of manslaughter might be legitimately overslaughed by these cumulative presumptions of malice. . It is in this point of view that we think the jury in this case had the right to consider and weigh the evidence objected to. They ivere sitting in judgment upon an act which, in point of law, was to be essentially characterized by the motive of the heart which prompted it. These in the order of Providence are hidden and beyond the reach of human law, until developed by acts of commission, or of omission, which present them to its judgment in determining the quality of the act brought in question. Every act then of either class, which in the range of probability could cast a ray of light upon the motive, which produced the homicide in question, was legitimately within the range of the investigation, although occurring at an antecedent time, or at another place unless forbidden by the rule designed to confine the investigation to the issue made; and this rule, as we have seen, does not exclude any evidence that tends to prove or elucidate any of the matters involved in the issue. And regarding the evidence objected to in this case as of that character, we think the court below properly allowed it to go to the jury. The second bill of exceptions raises the question, whether or not the confessions of the accused, being otherwise unexceptionable in point of law, can be allowed to be produced in evidence after the facts themselves have been proven by witnesses who were present when they transpired. We think it perfectly clear that they may, being both of the same grade of evidence, although differing in the weight to be given to them by the jury. In the third, it is admitted that it was shown that the confessions were obtained without the prisoner having been promised or threatened in any way, and that there was no inducement ,or reason held out to him to- answer the question propounded by one of his guards “what he had against the deceased to induce him to strike him,” or otherwise to talk upon the subject. But it is insisted, as the confessions were so made in response to that question, which it is urged implied the guilty act of the prisoner, and was made to one of his guard at a time when he was in chains and being brought to jail upon the charge in question, that they ought to have been excluded from the jury. In Mr. Greenleaf’s work on evidence the law upon this subject is thus stated: “Though it is necessary to the admissibility of a confession that it should have been voluntarily made, that is, that it should have been made, as before shown, without the appliances of hope or fear from persons having authority, yet it is not necessary that it should have been the prisoner’s own spontaneous act. It will be receivable though it were induced by spiritual exhortations, whether of a clergyman or any other person; by solemn promise of secrecy, even confirmed by an- oath, or by reason of the prisoner’s having been drunk, or by some collateral benefit or boon-, no hope or favor having been held out in respect to the criminal charge against him, or by any deception practiced on the prisoner or false representation made to him for that purpose, provided there is no reason to suppose that the inducement held out was calculated to produce any untrue confession, which is the main point to be considered. So, a confession is admissible though it is elicited by questions, whether put to a prisoner by a magistrate, officer or private person, and the form of the question is immaterial to the admissibility, even though it assumes the prisoner’s guilt, In all these cases the evidence may be laid before the jury, however little it may weigh under the circumstances, and however reprehensible may be the mode in which, in some of them, it was obtained.” ( Greenl. Ev. part , ch. , sec. , p. , edition.) Although in some few of the cases stated in this text, we would look closely to the authorities, upon which they are based, before declaring the law to the full extent that they are stated to go, we can have no hesitancy, on the question before us now, in holding that the objection taken was not good. The fourth bill of exceptions presents a question of practice in this wise. The name of Benjamin Watson, the master of the prisoner, was endorsed upon the indictment as a witness; he was summoned as such for the State, was in attendance upon the trial, and with the other State’s witnesses was sworn in chief, but he was not interrogated or put upon the stand by the State as a witness. The prisoner claimed the right to cross-examine him upon the whole case, and relied upon the English practice. The court overruled his motion. Upon an examination of the authorities, we think that the decided preponderance in the American courts, is in favor of confining the right of cross-examination to those facts and circumstances only, connected with the matters actually stated in the direct examination of a witness; and that if the cross-examining party wishes to examine the witness as to other matters, he must do so by making the witness his own-, and calling him as such in the subsequent progress of the case ( Greenl. Ev. part , ch. , sec. , p. .) The fifth bill of exceptions presents the question whether the owner of a slave is a competent witness in a prosecution involving the life of the slave. In this case he was offered as a witness on the part of the prisoner; the State objected because of his pecuniary interest as owner, and the court sustained the objection. This question first was discussed in North Carolina, in a case where a master refused to testify against his slave, and on error his appeal was sustained, but the court, in the discussion laid great stress upon the fact of general incompetency,-because of the law of that State, which made the master substantially a party to the record, by reason of the provision for a judgment of ¡costs against him upon the conviction of his slave. (State vs. Charity, Dev. Rep. ). In that case, however, Chief Justice Henderson delivered a separate opinion from the majority of the court, and foreshadowed the principles which have since been recognized and adopted in some of the other slave States. He said, “ My concurrence in the opinion of the court, in excluding the master on the ground of interest, is so feeble that it almost amounts to a dissent. Where pecuniary interest only is at stake, to exclude a witness on the score of interest, however small, is applying a scale of morality to our nature sufficiently humiliating. But when the life or death of a fellow being is to be the result of the trial, to exclude a witness because he may have a pecuniary interest, either in preserving or taking the life of the accused, is attributing to us, frail as we know ourselves to be, more depravity than we are willing, I think, to admit. The rule, as laid down by the court, as I understand it, excludes the master on the same ground, that of interest, in becoming a witness for his slave; for the rule must be mutual. If he cannot be compelled to give evidence against his slave, because of his interest, he cannot, even if he is willing, give evidence for him on the same ground. I should rather suppose that the interest at stake, being so entirely different from that which is ordinarily brought forward to protect a witness from giving evidence, orto exclude him> if willing, that it is not to be weighed in the same balances with mere pecuniary interest. It is so transcendant in its nature that its weight is not to be ascertained by mere money balances.” The same question afterwards arose in Tennessee, in a case where, like in this before us, the master’s evidence had been rejected by the Circuit Court, on the ground of interest. The court reversed the judgment for that error, and in delivering its opinion, by Reese, J., said: “ But it is said the Circuit Court erred in rejecting the master of the slave when offered as a witness in his favor, on the ground of his incompetency from pecuniary interest. And of this opinion are the court. A father has an interest, which may be valuable, in the services of his minor son, yet it is not questioned that he can be a witness for or against him on a charge affecting his life. A master may have a pecuniary interest in the future labor and services of his apprentice, much exceeding, it may be in a few pursuits, the entire value of his slave: yet perhaps it has never occurred to any one that the master is incompetent to testify on behalf of the apprentice in a matter affecting his life. The relation of master and slave is indeed different; but in a case like this, the law, upon high grounds of public policy, pretermits for a moment that relation, takes the slave out of the hands of his master, forgets his claims and rights of property,” — as in the case, the judge might have added, where the trespass for killing a slave is merged into the felony, and prohibits the recovery of the money value of the slave until the slayer has been first tried under an indictment for the felony. ( Porter Ala. Rep. )—“treats the slave as a rational and intelligent human being, responsible to moral, social and municipal duties and obligations and gives him the benefit of all the forms of trial which jealousy of power and love of liberty have induced a freeman to throw around himself for his own protection. If thep the master knows any fact tending to save the life of the slave, shall society, who have taken from him the slave for the purpose of trial, say to him, not that you are master, and we will weigh your credit, but you are master and shall not speak at all! On grounds of public policy, of common humanity, of absolute necessity, the master must be held to be competent as a witness for or against the slave. Society will not allow him to say, I have a pecuniary interest in the event of the trial, my testimony may subject me to a loss, and I will not testify against my slave. On the other hand, humanity forbids that society should say, you have such an interest and shall not be heard to prove a fact in his favor. In cases where one slave may kill another, the master may often be the only person cognizant of his guilt, or the only person who can establish his innocence. Shall he refuse to speak in the one case, lest he incur a loss? Shall his lips be sealed in the other, because he has an interest? Public policy and common humanity declare the necessity of so treating this relation that the guilty should not escape punishment, or the ipnocent be made to suffer.” (Elijah vs. The State, Humph. R. .) Afterwards, in the year , a case raising the same question was brought before the High Court of Errors and Appeals in Mississippi. That also was a case where the master of the slave was offered as a witness for him in the Circuit Court, and that court refused to allow him to testify, on the ground of interest; and for this error the Court of Errors reversed the judgment, and Chief Justice Sharkey, after approving the opinion of the court in Tennessee, which we have cited, as “based upon sound and humane principles” and recognizing the analogy to the case of master and apprentice, on the score of interest, then, in treating the question as one of public policy and common humanity, remarks as follows: “The master has the custody of his slave and owes to him protection, and it would be a rigorous rule indeed if the master could not be a witness in behalf of his slave What would be the condition of the slave, if the rule which binds him to perpetual servitude, should also create such an interest in the master as to deprive him of the testimony of that master? The hardships of such a rule will illy comport with that humanitjr which should be extended to that race of people. In prosecutions for offences, negroes are to be treated as other persons: and although the master may have had an interest in his servant, yet the servant had such an interest in the testimony of his master as will outweigh mere pecuniary considerations, nor can he be deprived of the benefit of that testimony by the mere circumstance that in a civil point of view he was regarded by the law as property.” Isham vs. The State, How. (Miss.) R. .) Recognizing these principles of law, public policy and common humanity, thus so aptly presented, as clearly sound, we adopt them without hesitancy, as the true exposition of the point of law in question, and therefore think it clear that the Circuit Court erred in refusing to allow Watson, the master, to testify when offered as a witness on the part of his slave, Austin, the appellant; holding that the matter of Watson’s pecuniary interest lay to his credibility only and not to his competency as a witness. The remaining question relates to so much of the charge of the court as was objected to and saved in the sixth bill of exceptions. That was, “That if the jury should find that the defendant was in rebellion to the authority of his master, Payne had a right to take the defendant and to use such force as was necessary to take him, and that if the defendant then attacked Payne and slew him, he was guilty of murder, and his offence could not be reduced to manslaughter, even although the striking of the defendant by Payne would have been evidence to show an extenuation of the killing of Payne by the defendant from murder to manslaughter, if the slave had not been at fault in acting in rebellion to the authority of his master.” From the face of this record we cannot say that this charge is too latitudinous and unqualified, because the bills of exception neither purport to save all the evidence produced on the trial of the cause, nor all to which the charge was applicable, so as- to exclude any presumption in favor of the charge, that other evidence in support of it might have been produced. But without any regard to this consideration, we are free to say, that the tranquility of the public at large, the security of the master, the value of the slave as property, and the just protection and comfort of the slave himself, all depend so essentially upon his entire subordination to the lawful authority of his master, that we would hesitate long before we would declare otherwise than that the principle, laid down in this charge, was any other than a sound general principle of the common law of slavery, as it exists in our slave States. In preserving this lawful subordination, upon which the best interests of the community, of the master, and of the slave, so radically depend, every citizen in common with the master, has an abiding interest. And when a slave is in rebellion to the lawful authority of his master, whatever force may be necessary to bring him within the pale of subordination, graduated upon principles of law and humanity, let it tcome from what quarter it may, invades no right of the slave, and consequently does him no such wrong as the law can recognize as a mitigation or excuse for crime. (Jacob vs. The State, Humph. R. .) For the error of the court below in refusing to allow Watson, the master, to testify, when offered as a witness on the part of the appellant, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded to be proceeded with to another trial and judgment.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862713,Biscoe et al. vs. Sandefur ad. et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"S. H. Hempstead, Special Judge, delivered the opinion of the court. A serious objection exists to the judgment of May, , which forbids us giving it.sanctity or effect. The act of the Legislature of 7th January, ', authorizing the Circuit Courts to recall judgments on delivery bonds, was pronounced unconstitutional and void by this court, in Byrd vs. Brown, Ark. , chiefly on the ground that the General Assembly possessed no power to authorize a Circuit Court to revise its own judgments- rendered at a previous term. Nothing need be added to the reasoning in that case, because if any proposition is self-evident, it is, that if the Legislature can confer on the Circuit Courts authority to revise one class of erroneous judgments, the same power may be conferred in all cases, and thus effectually deprive this tribunal of its appellate jurisdiction granted by the Constitution. This cannot be done, and hence recalling the previous judgment and entering judgment anew on the delivery bond, were proceedings coram non judice; and consequently the execution which issued on this new judgment, the levy on lands, their appraisement and offer for sale, were mere nullities, and must fall with the judgment, because no valid thing can spring from a void thing. And this brings us to the first judgment on the delivery bond rendered in . It was taken on mere motion, without process or notice, without detailing the facts otherwise than in the judgment itself, and was undoubtedly so erroneous, as to have been reversible on error, in a direct proceeding for that purpose, if that remedy had been sought by either party. It was, however, voidable merely, not void; and according to the doctrine in Borden vs. The State, Eng. , must be regarded by this court as a valid judgment, since the court pronouncing it was a superior court in contemplation of law, and had jurisdiction over the subject matter. There is then no alternative but to treat it as a binding judgment. The attempt of the same court at a subsequent term to recall it had no effect on it whatever. Fellows vs. Griffin, Smedes & Marsh. . Dowd vs. Hunt, Sm. & Marsh. . And it may be remarked, that in addition to the unconstitutionality of the law above alluded to, the court, on general principles, had no power to set aside its own judgments after the term had passed, inasmuch as jurisdiction over the subject matter had been exhausted, and to assume it again would be the same, in its effect, as acting in a case where there was an entire want of jurisdiction. This doctrine has been approved by this court in the cases of Ashley vs. Hyde, Eng. ; Cossitt vs. Biscoe, Eng. , and Rawdon vs. Rapley, Ark., and has become the settled law of this tribunal. The execution which issued on the original judgment was levied on two slaves as the property of Naborne T. Nelson, one of the defendants, on the 27th of November, , and were restored to his possession, upon his giving a delivery bond, signed by all the defendants in the original judgment, with Ambrose K. Ellett as security, and this bond was forfeited and judgment rendered on it, as stated, in , for the whole debt; the slaves levied on having been of that value. The question then is directly presented as to the effect of a levy and delivery bond on the original judgment, and the difference between a simple forfeiture not pursued to judgment and an actual judgment on the delivery bond. And to a proper understanding of the subject in all its bearings, it will be necessary to advert to the previous and present law concerning delivery bonds, noting such differences as may exist, but still regarding those laws as forming one system, according to the ancient rule of exposition, that acts in pari materia are to be construed together. As a system it is sui generis, and has afforded a fruitful field of litigation for more than ten years, and it would seem to be high time that something should be settled with regard to it. The counsel of the appellants have well said it is a “vexed question,” and although we might evade, yet we think it more compatible with duty to meet and decide it. s .. And first as to a levy on personal property. A levy on personal property belonging to the defendant, to an amount equal to the debt, is a temporary satisfaction of the judgment. But if the' property is fraudulently withdrawn by the defendant, or by his procurement or agency from the custody of the officer, or the defendant by his own act procures the release of the levy and the property comes again to his possession, it does not amount to satisfaction. Ontario Bank vs. Hallet, Cow. . Mickles vs. Haskin, Wend. . Green vs. Burke, Wend. . Ostrander vs. Walter, Hill . Piper vs Elwood, Denio . McGinnis vs. Sillard’s Ex’r, Bibb . Morrow vs. Hart, A. K. Marshall . Porter vs. Boone, Watts & Serg. . The People vs. Hopson, Denio . Peck vs. Tiffany, Comstock . And this doctrine, so conformable to justice and common sense, and so abundantly sustained by the best authorities, has been sanctioned by this court in cases running through a series of years, from the organization of the court to the present time. Walker vs. Bradley, Ark. . Caudle vs. Dare, Eng. . Sullivan vs. Pearce, Eng. . Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe, Eng. . Kelly vs. Garvin, Eng. . In the late case of Trapnall vs. Richardson, Ark. , it was said that “the law is understood by the court to be, that a levy on personal property is a satisfaction while the property remains in legal custody, but is not a satisfaction where the property is restored to the debtor, or in any manner gets back to his possession, or when the levy being exhausted by the sale, fails to produce satisfaction. In any such case the plaintiff is entitled to have further execution, and when the levy has been exhausted by sale, it is a satisfaction pro tanto, and execution will be had for the residue.” By the term levy, as used in this connection, must be understood, an act of seizure, which deprives the debtor of the possession of his property, or in other words, places it in the custody of the law to meet the debt, since it would be monstrous to hold that a mere levy on personal property, without regard to the fact that the debtor was deprived of it, should work a satisfaction either temporary or absolute; for in such a case the hands of the plaintiff might be tied, while the defendant was in the actual enjoyment of the property. This would be intolerable. It has undoubtedly been laid down in some books, that the defendants’ property is altered by a seizure'in execution, and that thereby the debtor loses his goods. To that effect is the ancient case of Clerke vs. Withers, Salk. , reported also in Modern , and other cases which have followed it. In that case, Powell, J., said: “the property, by the execution, is out of the defendant, whose goods they were.” Expressions of a similar import are ascribed to Lord Kelyng in Levinz , to Lord Holt in Holt’s Reports , and to Moreton, J., in Modern Reports . And in Ladd vs. Blunt, Mass. , Chief Justice Parsoxs, adopting that doctrine, said that by a lawful seizure, the debtor lost his property in the goods. Indeed the rule, that a levy is an absolute satisfaction, can rest on no other ground, and wherever it has been maintained, it has been on the authority alone of Clerke vs. Withers, as will be perceived by reference to the cases, Denton vs. Livingston, Johns. . Hoyt vs. Hudson, Johns. . But that doctrine is not correct, and has been effectually exploded. The officer by the seizure acquires a special property connected with the possession, and on that may maintain trespass or trover against any person who takes the goods away before the levy is legally disposed of. Willbrahan vs. Snow, Saund. and note c. Term Rep. . But the general property in the goods remains in the debtor, notwithstanding the seizure. And this L; warranted even by the old cases. Shelton’s case, Dyer , b. n. Milton vs. Ederington, Dyer a. In Brownlow , it is said, “if the sheriff shall by virtue of a fi. fa. levy the debt and damages of a man, and make return that the goods remain in his hands for want of buyers, the property remains still in the defendant, although-the sheriff hath possession of the goods.” In Waller vs. Weedale, Noy’s Rep. , the judgment debtor supported detinue against a sheriff, who had returned that he made the levy and had the goods but had not sold them. The court held that the sheiiff could not keep the goods and pay the debt with his own money. It would be difficult to account for this judgment, if the debtor had lost his property in the goods by the seizure. Justice Powell, in Mod. , admits that if by any accident the execution determines, the debtor shall have his goods again. In Ayre vs. Aden, Yelv. , it is said that by “seizing the goods the owner’s property is not altered.” Lord Hardwicks observed in Lowthall vs. Tonkins, Eq. Cas. Abr. , that the property of the goods continues in the defendant until execution executed; which means until the sale of the goods. Thompson vs. Clerke, Cro. Eliz. . Shallcomb vs. Cross, Ld. Raym. . Cooper vs. Chitty, Burr. . Payne vs. Dreeve, East. . American decisions may be found in abundance to the same effect. Thus in Sadd vs. North, Mass. , Parsons, C. J., says that the special property of the sheriff is defeasible by the defendant’s paying the execution in money, before the sale of the goods. In Blake vs. Shaw, Mass. , and Ludden vs. Leavitt, Mass. , it was held that the general property in goods is not changed until a levy and sale by execution; or in technical language, until execution executed, Catlin vs. Jackson, Johns. . It was never supposed that the property in an estray, or in goods distrained was lost or altered by the seizure; nor that goods pawned with a limited time for redemption, ceased to be the property of the pawnor. Yet in each of these instances, there is an inchoate act which renders the property liable to be altered and lost by the negligence, or inability of the owner; but it may be saved by his seasonable interposition. This is the true state of property seized on afi.fa. and in legal custody. It is perfectly clear, on both authority and principle, that the sheriff' only acquires a special property in the goods by the seizure; the judgment creditor none at all, and that the general property remains in the debtor, until sale under execution. A mere levy then on personal property, without anything more, does not divest the title of the debtor, nor change it, nor does the levy amounts,to satisfaction, as before observed, Eng. . The true rule is, that satisfaction takes place only when the execution has been so used as to change the title, or in some other way deprive the debtor of his property, to the amount of the judgment. This includes the case of a levy and sale, and also the loss or destruction of the goods, otherwise than by the act of God, and without fault or misconduct on the part of the debtor. It does not divest a title, but only creates a lien on the property. The levy may be overreached by some paramount lien or be defeated by the act or misconduct of the debtor, or become entirely ineffectual in consequence of the property coming again to his possession and use, as upon giving a delivery bond. Another instance may be given. The idea of satisfaction rests on the main ground that the debtor is deprived of a sufficiency of property belonging to him to discharge the debt, and although the presumption is, that property seized belongs to the defendant, yet, if in point of fact, the contrary is true, and he has no' interest in it subject to execution, the levy, so far from being even a temporary satisfaction, can have no effect at all, because the debtor is deprived of nothing, and is not injured by a levy on property not belonging to him, and of course can derive no benefit from it. On no principle of law or reason can the seizure of property of one person satisfy an execution against another, Cowen , Wend. , Wend. . In these and other cases falling within a like principle, there is no color for saying the judgment is satisfied or affected. The case of The People vs. Hopson, Denio , is a decisive authority to sustain these positions and was cited with approbation by this court in Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe, Eng. , and Kelly vs. Garvin, Eng. , in both of which cases it was explicitly announced as a fixed rule, that a mere levy on sufficient personal property of a defendant, without anything more, never amounted to the satisfaction of a judgment, and that the only effect was, that so long as the property remained in legal custody, the other remedies of the creditor would be suspended. In Peck vs. Tiffany, Coms. , the court oí appeals of New York, used this language, “There are some old cases in which dicta are found that a levy on sufficient personal property to satisfy an execution, is a satisfaction; but that doctrine has been long since exploded Where a sheriff levies on sufficient personal property, and through his negligence or misconduct it is lost, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of, so that the defendant is deprived of the benefit of it, there is no doubt it should be regarded as a satisfaction of the execution and the plaintiff must seek his remedy against the sheriff. But where the debtor has neither paid the debt, nor been deprived of his property, the simple act of levying upon it, is not a satisfaction, whether the debtor has been permitted to retain the property, either by his own misconduct, or by his request, or the voluntary act of the officer, because neither work any wrong to him.” The court cited Greene vs. Burke, Wend. . Ostrander vs. Walter, Hill . Taylor vs. Rauney, Hill . Voorhees vs. Gross, How. Pr. Rep. . And this court, in Sullivan vs. Pierce, Eng. , said that a mere levy on property did not constitute satisfaction. Now satisfaction depends on two things ; first, on the fact that a sufficiency of property belonging to the defendant, has been seized to meet the debt; and second, that the debtor is deprived of it. And even then the satisfaction is temporary, not absolute, subsisting only as long as the property remains in legal custody, and hence this court, in the case in Eng. , correctly remarked, that the greatest extent, to which the authorities had gone, had been that where property was taken in execution, and remained in the hands of the officer unsold, it might be considered as a temporary satisfaction, to the extent that it must be disposed of before other property can be taken in execution. The effect of the levy in that case was held to be destroyed by the return of the property to the defendant on the order of the plaintiff, and which left the latter perfectly free to proceed on the judgment. In Dugan vs. Fowler, Ark., this court said it had been repeatedly held that, an existing unsatisfied levy on property, suffi■cient in value to satisfy the judgment, is a satisfaction, but not an absolute satisfaction in any event; that it must depend on circumstances connected with the future disposition of the levy, whether it is an absolute satisfaction or not; that the cases of Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe, and Trapnall vs. Richardson, had settled the general principle that a subsisting undischarged levy upon property sufficient to satisfy the judgment, is a satisfaction until, by the discharge of the levy by sale or otherwise, it proves to be partial or incomplete. It is almost superfluous to remark, that a levy is discharged or legally disposed of by giving a delivery bond, to retain the possession of the property. It is no longer in legal custody and the levy does not subsist for any purpose whatever. As before intimated, it must be understood that if on a judicial sale the property in the hands of the officer proves insufficient, the judgment with all its consequences subsists in full force as to the balance of the debt; because pai'tial payment can never extinguish an entire demand, and the plaintiff is in no fault, because the property does not bring the whole debt. Denio . We think it must be regarded as a settled and inflexible rule in this State, that a judgment is neither satisfied nor affected when the property seized is fraudulently withdrawn by the defendant or his procurement or agency from the custody of the officer; or the defendant by his own act, as giving a delivery bond, procures its release, and it comes again to his possession and resumes its place among the mass of his property, or the property seized does not belong to the defendant. In such cases the judgment would not only maintain its vitality against the defendant, but its priority as to other judgment creditors; because the plaintiff has lost no lien by tampering with the levy; nor his priority by any agreement to release property; nor are his rights postponed or suspended by any act he has done, Greene vs. Burke, Wend. . And cases falling within a like principle would necessarily be governed by the same rules. We have said this much as to the effect of a levy on personal property, and how it may be discharged, because it was a necessary part of our inquiry, and for the further reason that some misapprehension seemed to exist with regard to it- As to this branch of the subject it only remains to say that the doctrine announced is considered to be just to both debtor and creditor; to the former, because protecting him from the oppression of a further levy, when suflicient property of his remains in the custody of the law to produce satisfaction; to the latter, because preserving to him rights not yielded, and appropriately rewarding his vigilance in their prosecution. . As to the ejject of a delivery bond on the judgment. A delivery bond, under the law as it existed in the Revised Statutes, was required to be given to the plaintiff in double the value of the property seized in execution, with sufficient security to be approved by the officer. But on forfeiture it did not have the force and .effect of a judgment, nor could execution be issued against all the obligors, as is the case at present. Rev. Stat. ; Digest , . It was intended for the ease and favor of the debtor, and formed a part of that system of legislative relief peculiar to some of the western and southern States, and which, jn its practical operation, is believed in mosteases to have proved detrimental to both the debtor and creditor. Under the present law, no matter what the value of the property levied on is, the bond must secure the whole “debt, damages, interest and costs,” and on forfeiture, execution issues on the statutory judgment, against all the obligors, for the whole amount upaid, Digest . And in view of this new feature we think, when the bond is returned forfeited, the clerk should in all cases note it on his judgment docket, setting forth the names of the obligors, the date of the forfeiture, and fhe amount of the debt, damages and costs, as in the case of judgments formally rendered in the Circuit Court, to the end that record evidence may exist; and the utmost publicity be given to a proceeding which, on a fair construction of our law, must necessarily operate as a lien on the real estate of the obligors in the county from the date of the forfeiture, Digest . The statute respecting the lien of judgments .and decrees does in spirit, although not in letter, embrace such cases, and the establishment of the rule is only carrying out what the Legislature must have intended, because otherwise the creditor might be placed in a worse situation than he was in before, and lose important rights without an equivalent. The delivery bond under the previous law, afforded a cumulative remedy merely, of which the plaintiff might avail himself at his election. He was not obliged to do so, but could proceed on the original judgment, which was neither satisfied, extinguished, nor affected by the taking and forfeiture of the bond. By electing however, to proceed on it to judgment, either in a summary manner by motion or by an ordinary suit, the effect could not be otherwise than to extinguish the previous judgment; because the creditor not only had a new one, but additional security, thus resembling in some respects accord and satisfaction. Pope vs. Tunstall, Ark. . By thus proceeding, the plaintiff virtually accepted the new judgment in lieu of the original, and could not, on well established principles of law, resort to the latter to obtain satisfaction of the debt. And it followed as a necessary consequence, that all liens arising under the original judgment or executions issued on it were released, or in other words, such liens, the real judgment, and the delivery bond itself, on which the new' judgment was based, were all merged in such new judgment. Bac. Abr. D. . And the recourse of the plaintiff was from thenceforward against the parties on the new judgment. In Purdy vs. Doyle, Paige , it was held that where a creditor obtained a lien upon real estate by a judgment, and subsequently brought an action of debt on that judgment, and recovered a new one, the lien of the first judgment was lost. This is what Chief Justice Marshall in The United States vs. Graves, Brock. , called “a technical satisfaction” of the previous judgment. When the plaintiff elected to proceed, and by his own voluntary act substituted the new for the original judgment, the case then stood on the same footing as it does in those States where the law accords to a forfeited delivery bond, the force and effect of a judgment, and on which an execution issues as a matter of right without further proceedings. Our present law concerning delivery bonds derived its main features from Virginia. Kentucky and Mississippi drew their law on this subject from the same fountain head. The decisions in those States, as to the proper construction and effect of this law, are entitled to great respect and should weigh heavily in arriving at a proper conclusion, although not absolutely binding on this court. In Virginia, if. a forthcoming bond is forfeited the execution is at an end, because the forfeiture had the effect of a judgment, and execution issued against all the obligors on this statutory or constructive judgment. Lusk vs. Ramsey, Munf. . Cooke vs. Piles, Munf. . The bond there covered the whole debt, regardless of the value of the property levied on, and on forfeiture had the effect of a judgment by express statute. Hen. Stat. , . And the forthcoming bond was no satisfaction of a judgment until forfeiture. Munf. . In the case above cited in Brock. , Chief Justice Marshall, in reviewing the decisions of the courts of Virginia, said: “They have undoubtedly determined that a forthcoming bond when forfeited, is a satisfaction of the judgment on which the execution issued, and that no further proceedings can be founded on that judgment. The forthcoming bond is substituted for the judgment, and the recourse of the plaintiff is against the parties to that bond.” And so a replevy bond in Virginia extinguished the judgment, for the reason that by statute the creditor approved the security, and the bond, as soon as executed, had the force of a judgment for the whole debt, and execution issued against all the obligors without any further proceedings. Munf. ; and it was said to be “as complete an execution of the judgment as if the estate of the defendant had been sold to the full amount of the debt, and the party was left to pursue his own remedy upon the bond.” Taylor vs. Dundass, Wash. . In Mississippi, the law of Virginia having been, as already stated, substantially adopted, a forthcoming bond covered the whole debt and had the force and effect of a judgment when forfeited, How. & Hutch. Stat. . No judicial action was necessary to produce that result, and execution issued on this statutory as upon any other judgment. Miner vs. Lancashire, How. Miss. R. . Wanzee vs. Barker, ib. . Sanders vs. McDowell, ib. . United States Bank vs. Patton, How. Miss. R. . McNutt vs. Wilcox, How. Miss. R. . Annis vs. Smith, Peters . Brown vs. Clarke, How. S. C. R. . And so effectual is this satisfaction, that after a delivery bond taken and forfeited, a second execution, levy and bond on the original judgment are utterly void, and it was so expressly held in Witherspoon vs. Spring, How. Miss. R. . The original judgment being entirely extinguished could only be revived by the quashal of the bond; until which time its lien was gone, and all levies made under it were released. “The forfeiture of the bond,” says the court, in How. , “extinguishes or satisfies, as it is said, the original judgment; because it is a proceeding arising on it, and has in itself the force and effect, and is of equal dignity with a judgment, and a plaintiff is not entitled to two subsisting judgments on the same cause of action against the same individuals. It is like a second judgment, obtained by an action on the first; the plaintiff cannot proceed to enforce the first, but must rely on the second.” Bac. Abr. D. . Again in Clarke vs. Anderson, How. Miss. R. , it was said that the forthcoming bond after forfeiture becomes, by operation of law, a judgment, and necessarily extinguishes the former judgment, because two judgments are'not allowed at the same time, against the same person on the same cause of action.” And in Burns vs. Stanton, S. & M. , it was decided that the original judgment after the forfeiture of the bond, was no longer in existence. And it has been further held, that as the forfeiture of a forthcoming bond is a satisfaction of the original judgment, the lien of it is extinguished and a new lien commences with the forfeiture of the bond, on new parties, and that any execution issued on the original judgment afterwards is a nullity, and a sale under it passes no title. McComb vs. Ellett, S. & M. . Robinson vs. Tainter, ib. . Chilton vs. Cox, S. & M. . The Supreme Court of the United States, in Brown vs. Clarke, How. , took the same view of the subject. It is there said that “the lien of the first judgment ceases, and a new and more comprehensive lien arises upon the statutory judgment, embracing the'property of both principal and sureties in the forthcoming bond, and no action of the court is necessary on the forfeited bond. As soon as the bond is forfeited the old judgment is extinguished, and a new lien attaches.” This new judgment is considered as possessing the qualities, force, effect and dignity of a judgment obtained in the ordinary mode of proceeding according to the course of the common law, and in a court of competent jurisdiction; a scire facias may be issued to have execution upon it, ( How. Miss. R. ,) and in another State it will be regarded as a judicial proceeding within the meaning of the act of'Congress of . As a judicial proceeding it may challenge full faith and credit, and can no more be impeached collaterally than any other judgment. This precise question came under review in the court of appeals of Kentucky, in the case of Kelly vs. Lank, B. Monroe , and was fully discussed and ably considered. It was an action of debt brought on one of these statutory judgments from the State of Mississippi, and the court held that while the statutory judgment remained in force, unreversed or annulled, it was record evidence of right in the plaintiffs, and could only be impeached by evidence of as high a grade as itself; and further, that nul ticl record was the only proper or admissible defence to it in their courts. In Kentucky, a delivery bond is for the whole debt, and on forfeiture has the force and effect of a judgment on which execution issues as of course. Morehead & Brown's Laws Ky. . Joyce vs. Farquar, A. K. Marsh. , . Chitty vs. Gleim., Mon. . And so, as in Virginia, a replevy bond is held to be an extinguishment of the previous judgment, and of all liens created by execution, because the bond when made has the force and effect of a judgment, and execution issues against all the obligors for the whole debt. The present law came before, this court in Reardon ex part, Eng. , and was pronounced constitutional. Subsequently’, in the case of Ruddell vs. Magruder, Eng. , that case was confirmed, and it was held that the non-delivery of the property transformed the bond, by operation of law, into a statutory j udgment, on which execution might issue against all the obligors, for the debt, interest and cost remaining unpaid; that the forfeiture imparted to the bond the force and effect of a judgment, and that the sheriff’s return of forfeiture was conclusive evidence of the fact, and could not be controverted by parol proof. Substantially, the doctrine of the cases in Mississippi is adopted by this, and undoubtedly where the law is the same, the decisions of the courts should correspond, as far as justice, comity and reason will permit. And we think it would be impossible to establish any other doctrine, without leaving the debtor exposed to greivous evils, without seriously impairing the harmony of the law, and without departing from the manifest intention of the legislature. It will strike every one that it is not the fact of giving a delivery bond and its forfeiture, that works the extinguishment of the previous judgment. It is the fact that the forfeiture, by .express statutory enactment, ipso facto, has the force and effect .of a judgment, becomes a lien by necessary implication against new parties from the date of the forfeiture, and execution issues on this new statutory judgment against all the obligors; or .as was the case with the bond in question, where the forfeiture had no such effect, it was only when judgment was actually rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, that the original judgment became extinguished, its lien destroyed and the execution ended. The mere giving and forfeiture of the bond could not affect the judgment, if the creditor chose to still proceed on it, and not proceed to judgment on the bond. As stated, the plaintiff was not bound to resort to the bond and thus surrender any security which the original judgment afforded, unless he felt disposed to do so. But if he elected to pursue that remedy to obtain the payment of his demand, he could not capriciously abandon it. Eng. . In Campbell vs. Spence, Ala. , it was held that a forfeited delivery bond was no satisfaction, and did not impair the lien of the judgment. And in Leach vs. Will iams, Alab. , which was a case of conflicting liens, it was held that when goods seized were delivered to the defendant on his giving a forthcoming bond, which was forfeited, so that they could not be sold, the plaintiff might have a new execution, because it did not amount to' satisfaction in law. Ala. . Ala. . Ala. . These cases are presumed to have been decided on a statute similar to our previous law. We think it has been settled in this court, that a forfeited delivery bond, not having the force and effect of a judgment and not proceeded on to judgment, is no extinguishment or satisfaction of a judgment, either temporary or absolute, nor does it have the effect of breaking or interrupting the judgment lien as between judgment creditors. Thus in Caudle vs. Dare, Eng. , after a delivery bond forfeited, which did not have the force and effect of a judgment, the plaintiff was allowed to proceed on the original judgment, and disregard the bond, the court remarking that “personal property levied on by virtue of the original execution, being returned to the defendant, did not satisfy the execution,” citing Walker vs. Bradley, Ark. , where it was decided that levying an execution on the property of a judgment debtor is no satisfaction where the property does not remain in possession of the sheriff, but is re-delivered to the defendant on his giving a delivery bond. In Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe, Eng. , it was held that where a levy was made and a delivery bond taken and forfeited, and which by statute had the force of a judgment the levy was discharged, and the judgment on which the execution issued, satisfied. And various cases were cited which clearly sustained that position. In Kelly vs. Garvin, Eng. , it was held that a forfeited delivery bond under the present law amounted to the extinguishment of the original judgment, and the creation of a new one by force of the statute. And it is proper to observe, that as a forfeited forthcoming bond, whilst in force under the existing law, is a satisfaction of the first judgment, a faulty or irregular bond may be quashed on motion, at the return term of the execution, and thus remove the. impediment to proceeding on the judgment. Downman vs. Downman, Wash. . The rights and remedies of parties to the bond, and the time and manner of their assertion may be collected from the cases of Reardon ex parte, Eng. ; Ruddell vs. Magruder, Eng. ; and that of Kelly vs. Lank, B. Mon. , and the authorities therein cited. On a parity of reasoning a bond, which on forfeiture had not the force and effect of a judgment, could not possibly extinguish or impair the original judgment, interrupt its lien, or arrest proceedings on it; because to so hold would be to declare that inferior could destroy evidence of debt of the highest grade and dignity, and that a mere cause of action could extinguish the solemn judgment of a court of record. Such a doctrine would contravene every principle of law laid down in the books. Indeed the technical satisfaction springing up under the present law almost reaches the verge of constitutioual authority, and could not go much farther and be upheld and maintained. The previous statute itself shows clearly that the mere taking and forfeiture of a bond, without proceeding to judgment on it, had no effect on the original judgment; because, upon the condition being broken, the officer could seize the same, “or any other property of the defendant,” and sell the same to satisfy the execution, thus in the amplest manner recognizing the judgment and execution as in full force and unsatisfied, Rev. Stat. . The plaintiff was not confined to the specific property levied on, and which had been released from legal custody on giving the bond. The officer was not obliged to seize it again on execution, but had the right to resort to any other property of the defendant, real, pei’sonal, or mixed, subject to execution, and sell the same on five days notice, except land and slaves, which could only be sold on the usual notice; Cummins vs. Webb, Ark. . This most clearly demonstrated that on that statute, as well as on general principles, after giving a delivery bond there never was the slightest reason for saying that the levy remained undisposed of, or that the property still remained in legal custody, subject to the execution, or that the plaintiff was precluded from resorting to other property until the levy was exhausted, or that it amounted to a satisfaction, or had the slightest influence on the original judgment, when the plaintiff elected to proceed on such judgment. Certainly it cannot be doubted that the restoration of property to'the defendant on giving a bond for its delivery, was such a legal and effectual disposition of the property as to remove or discharge the levy. Dallas , Taylor vs. Royal Saxon. Wallace , Walker vs. McDowell. Smedes & Marshall, . After that the officer was not responsible for the safe keeping of the property, or for its value, nor did the defendant hold it under, or for him, or for the plaintiff. It was no longer in legal custody, for if so no further levy could be made until that was disposed of. We have seen that a further levy might be made, and that other property might be seized on the same judgment and execution. The officer had no special property, and could not maintain trespass or trover for injuring or converting the property, as he-could do if it still remained in legal custody. Although the officer, before the day appointed for its delivery, might see the property wasting or about to be alienated, yet he would have no right to become the curator of it, or interfere in any way, as he might and as it would be his duty to do if it was still in custodia legis. In fact, all that the officer had to do to avoid responsibility, was to see that the security on the $bnd was sufficient, as the law made him answerable for that. But the property remained in the possession and under the absolute control of the defendant, and belonged to him for all practical purposes, and whether it was or was not charged with a lien could make no difference. The defendant might or might not deliver it at his election, because he might prefer to submit to the penalty for a failure; the law on a fair construction giving him that right. The officer could take no measure to force the debtor to have the goods forthcoming at the day of sale; and if the officer was bound to receive a sufficient delivery bond when tendered, and part, with the possession of the goods, was in no manner liable for them, could take no measure to compel their delivery, and could bring no action concerning them; it follows inevitably, in the language of Lord Holt, that there was “no person who could make title to the goods by virtue of the execution,” and that the debtor was therefore restored to his rights over them, Mod. ; Munf. . The idea of legal custody of them was utterly excluded, for, as has been shown, by the giving of the bond, the levy in contemplation of law was legally disposed of, and to still consider the goods as held under and by virtue of the execution would be an absurdity in itself. Malone vs. Abbott, Humphries . If there had been no authority on this point at all, the previous statute would settle the question; because if a forfeited delivery bond, not having the effect of a judgment and without judgment being sought or pronounced on it, could amount to the extinguishment of the original judgment and satisfaction of the execution, no further levy could possibly be made, and the plaintiffs, nolens volens, would be obliged to resort to the bond. But that law recognized both judgment and execution to be still effectual for all purposes. We have not lost sight of the fact that the 39th section of the execution law, authorizing the officer, when the condition of the bond was broken, to seize the same or any other property of the defendant subject to the execution, and sell the same on short notice to satisfy the execution, was repealed on the 3d December, , Rev. Stat. ; Acts , p. . It was revived on the 6th of December, . Acts , p. . We have referred to, and argued from it merely to illustrate a general principle, and to evince the intention of the law maker at the time of the enactment of the system, as to the effect of a forfeited delivery bond pursued to judgment, and not pursued to judgment, and to demonstrate that such intention was in perfect harmony with general principles of law on the subject. Our reasoning and decision however, rest on the latter and not on any statutory provision. The original judgment mentioned in the bill, was rendered on the 8th of October, ;y?. fa. issued thereon the 27th of November, ; delivery bonds executed on the 4th of March, , and forfeited the 4th of April, , and judgment was rendered on the delivery bond, on motion, at the April term, . All these proceedings were had when the above section was not in force; and as the counsel for the appellants admit, that if there was no statute providing that the lien should remain, and the sheriff seize and sell without process, the lien of the levy and the sheriff’s title are absolutely discharged by giving a delivery bond: we might say shortly that there being no such statute, when the proceedings were had, it would follow on their own reasoning, that there was no lien on the slaves levied on, to be asserted or pursued, and that the court very properly refused to recognize or enforce it, especially after such a lapse of time, and against bona fide purchasers at a public sale, who have ever been, and ought to be favorites of a court of equity, and whose titles or possessions are not to be disturbed except upon the strongest and most conclusive grounds, and certainly not on astute constructions, doubtful implications, or stale claims. There can be no question but that it is sound policy, as well as the duty of courts to strongly incline to uphold sales, made under the authority of law, and protect the title of puz’chasers, because prudent men az’e not disposed to risk their money in so precarious an izivestment as the purchase of law suits; and if szich a policy did not prevail the sacrifice of property at judicial sales would be as ruinous as it would be inevitable. But that proposition admits of a more conclusive answer, which is, fiz-st, that after the delivery bond the shez’iff has no title to the goods of any sort, and the levy is released; and second, treating that section as not repealed, the effect would be the same,because in the constz’uction of statutes, every part must stand it possible and that could only be effected, in cases circumstanced as this is, by holding that their lien could subsist no longer than the judgment remained in foz’ce, and that if the plaintiff should abandon the original judgment and obtain a new judgment on the bond in cases where the property levied on was of equal value with the debt, he must abide by all the consequences flowing fz’om that step; which have been declared to be, that the original judgment was thereby extinguished, its lien merged in the new judgment, and such lien as arose from the levy released and forever discharged, and the execution end-' ed. This, we think, was the true intention of the Legislature. This would operate as a postponement of the collection of the debt, and to that extent afford relief to the debtor, and for which the creditor is supposed to have obtained additional security on the responsibility of the officer as to taking a sufficient bond. Although not compelled, yet if the plaintiff elected to proceed to judgment on the bond, then it was like an ordinary case of waiving a lien created for his benefit, which waiver may be either express or implied. The statute fails to define exactly how long the lien of a levy, so called, shall last, or when it shall end, but that and the subsequent section authorizing the seizure of that or any other property of the defendant to satisfy the execution, when the condition of the bond was broken, and selling personal property on short notice, indicate clearly enough, when taken together, that the lien could not subsist, when the old was merged in the new judgment, since the accessary must follow' the principal. Harrison vs. Wilson, A. K. Marsh. . And the reason of the rule is that the law', condemning a multiplicity of suits, which too often unnecessarily harrasss a defendant, will not as it has been said, suffer two subsisting judgments on the same cause of action against the same individual. Nor does this at all conflict with the rule, that a party, having several subsisting remedies, may pursue any one or all of them until he obtains actual satisfaction, (Taylor vs. Thomson, Peters, ); for that rule is not to be shaken or weakened. Cases might and doubtless did occur under the previous law, where the property seized was less in value than the debt, and consequently the plaintiff had no choice and was obliged, by motives of self interest and necessity, to proceed on the original judgment, regardless of the delivery bond, thus showing that it could not have been intended, as it could not be in fact, a satisfaction, or tie up the hands of the plaintiff from proceeding on the judgment. This can never occur under the existing law, because the bond covers the whole debt, irrespective of the value of the property. The expression in the statute, that the “levy shall remain a lien upon the property,” means no more than that there is a lien upon it, not substantially different from that general one which an execution creates upon being placed in the hands of the officer. It does not mean that the property is in legal custody, or does not belong to the defendant in the same manner as his other personal property, and the authority to seize it, “into whose possession soever the same may have passed,” was intended to guard against fraudulent alienations; but not to inhibit bona fide sales before execution executed. The provision, that “no execution shall be a lien,” but from the time such writ •shall be delivered to the officer,” (Digest, ), has been repeatedly held not to alter the property of the goods until the execution is executed, ( Johns. ; East, ), and so, on a parity •of reasoning, the provision above alluded to would have no greater effect. And this exposition we conceive to be in exact accordance with the policy of the law, which does not encourage liens •on personal property when the possession is parted with, be-, •cause such liens are of a secret nature, and tend to embarrass and obstruct the free alienation of property, so necessary in the trade and commerce of men. They open the door to the perpetration of frauds on innocent persons, and owing to the mobility of personalty, nothing can be more uncertain than such liens and in no case should they be extended or enlarged by judicial construction, Wend. . In point of dignity and certainty they are not like liens on real estate created by judgments, or evidenced by recorded mortgages, for these are public and notorious, and preserved in the records of the country, to which all have access, and of which all are bound to take notice, in all cases where the law makes such 'records operate in that way. The Legislature might have considered that the seizure of property to answer the debt, the release of the levy on giving a delivery bond, ( Yerger, ), and the passing of the goods out of the possession and custody of the officer into the hands of the defendant again, might, in the absence of any enactment, be construed into the loss of all lien whatever; on a principle sound in law, that as a general rule, possession of personal property is essential to the creation as well as to the continuance of a lien on it. Kent, . When a party voluntarily parts with the possession of the property, upon which a lien has attached, such lien is divested, because it has been well said, that if it was to follow the goods after they had been sold or delivered, the incumbrance would become excessively inconvenient to the freedom of trade, and the safety of purchasers. Stra. ; East. ; East. ; East. ; Wend. ; Eng. . It has been said by this court that the lien is only co-existent with the possession of the article, and being once surrendered, cannot be revived by any subsequently acquired possession. Eng. . It is true that this doctrine, arising from a different lien, could not apply in terms, but only by analogy to the lien of an execution, and to what we consider as the same in effect — the lien of a levy, since the latter too originates under the execution and stands on the same footing. The Legislature therefore might not have thought it labor thrown away to exclude the conclusion that might otherwise have been drawn from the restoration of possession to the defendant. But however full and inflexible and public the lien might be, still it could not discharge nor affect a judgment, nor amount to satisfaction, because it is indisputable, on both authority and principle, that a lien is neither a right in or to the thing, but is simply a right on the part of the creditor to have the property, charged with the lien, appropriated for the purposes of satisfaction, if he shall feel disposed to do so. Peters. ; Mason, ; Peere Wms., . The fact, that the lien exists, does not place the property in legal custody, nor appropriate it to the payment of the debt. The two negroes, originally levied on and released upon giving the delivery bond, were sold under an order of court, at public sale, by the administrator, as the property of Norbone T. Nelson, deceased, on the first of January, , and purchased by Draper and Williams, two of the appellees. From the views above expressed it is manifest, that the Real Estate Bank, had no lien on, or claim to them, and the decree of the court dismissing the bill as to them was correct. Thomas M. R. Bankhead, as administrator of Norbone T. Nelson, answered the bill and insisted that the claim set up by the complainants had not been presented and authenticated according to law against the estate of his intestate within two years from the date of letters of administration, and that the same was barred. The court being of that opinion, dismissed the bill as to» him. This decree we think was right. It falls within the principle decided by this court in Walker vs. Byers, Ark., where it was held that, with the exceptions therein specified, all claims and demands against the estates of deceased persons, whether legal or equitable, must be exhibited properly authenticated, within the period of two years, or be forever barred. This claim is not within any of the exceptions and therefore that case is a decisive authority on the question that the appellants can have no relief against the estate of Norbone T. Nelson, or his heirs, ordistributees. Whatever errors exist in the decree as - to Joanna T. Carrington, administratrix of Robert Carrington, deceased, Charles T. Nelson, and Ambrose K. Ellett, cannot be noticed as these parties have not appealed, and certainly there is nothing,of which», the appellants have a right to complain. Let the decree be affirmed. Watkins, C.

1862658,"Phillips, et al. vs. Wills, Pease & Co.","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1852-07,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. This writ of error was sued out by the plaintiffs in error, to a judgment obtained against them in the Clark Circuit Court, after execution had been issued and levied upon their property, and they, together with others, as securities, executed a forthcoming bond, and the same had been forfeited, and so returned by the sheriff, and the return term had elapsed, as appears by the dates set out. These facts were set up by plea, to which a demurrer was interposed, and the question is thus presented, whether the plaintiffs in error can now maintain their writ of error to the original judgment. The constitutionality of the forthcoming law act was considered and determined in the case of Reardon, Ex parte, Eng. R. . Its unconstitutionality was again urged in the case of Ruddell vs. McGruder, ( Eng. R. ), and the point again ruled as in the former case, with the additional intimation that, after the lapse of the term, to which the forthcoming bond was returnable, the obligors of the bond could find relief only in a court of equity. Afterwards, in the case of Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe, et al. Eng. R. , it was held, that after the forfeiture of the bond the levy was discharged and the former judgment was satisfied. And to the same effect are the cases of Wright vs. Yell, et al. Ark. , and Jamison vs. May, id. . And in the case of The Trustees of the Real Estate Bank vs. Sandefur, ad. et al. decided during the present term, where many of the cases decided in Kentucky, Vix*ginia, Mississippi and the Federal Court, as well as our own, are reviewed, it is shown that the statutory judgment is considered as having the qualities, force, effect and dignity of a judgment, obtained in the ordinaiy mode of proceeding according to the course of the common law, in a court of competent jurisdiction, and as such may be revived by scire facias, and, in another State, is within the act of Congress of , and can no more be impeached collaterally than any other judgment, (Kelly vs. Lambs, B. Monroe, p. .) And these cases sustain the decision of this court in the case of Kelly et al. vs. Garvin, Carson & Co., ( Eng. R. at p. ), where it is held that “the statutory judgment is an extinguishment of the first judgment upon the principle that a party cannot have more than one judgment for the same subject matter at the same time.” These consequences resulting from the voluntary act of the defendant in the execution executing the forthcoming bond under the provisions of the statute, it is no more unreasonable that he should thereby be cut off from any further remedy in a court of law, and be driven to a court of equity exclusively for relief, as against any other judgment at law, than making an injunction operate as a release of errors at law. We think the matters set up in the plea sufficient, and therefore the writ of error must be quashed. Watkins, C. J., did not sit.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862632,Dougherty vs. McDonald,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins said, The question presented in this case, is the same as that decided in Hart, et al. vs. Wills, Pease & Co., on a former day of this term. The defendant in error pl'eads in bar of the writ, that before it was sued out, a writ of fieri facias issued upon the judgment complained of as being erroneous, and the execution being levied upon certain goods of the defendants, for the production of which, at the time and place of sale, they had entered into a delivery bond with security, and containing the further condition prescribed by the act of Deccember 16th, , that in case the property, specified in the bond, should not be delivered as provided therein, the bond should have the force and effect of a judgment, on which an execution might be issued against all the obligors therein; that the property not being delivered nor the execution paid, the sheriff had duly returned the execution unsatisfied, together with the delivery bond declared to be forfeited, &c.,'to which plea the plaintiffs in error have demurred. It might be sufficient to say that the decision of the court is in accordance with that made in Hart vs. Wills, Pease & Co., before referred to, overruling the demurrer; but as this is the first opportunity I have had of expressing any opinion of my own on this subject, it seems to be proper that should avail myself of at, though in a very brief manner. When this question was first raised, I thought there were serious difficulties attending the determination of it, either way. When the act of December was passed, after several years of uncertainty and litigation, the effect of delivery bonds and the mode of obtaining judgments upon them, where the creditor chose to pursue that course, had come to be settled and understood according to pre-existing statutes; and though doubtless enacted with the earnest intention of strengthening the obligation of contracts by facilitating the remedy for any breach of them, it seemed to me that the various questions, growing out of the proper construction to be given to the amendatory statute, so as to harmonize it with the general law as it stood before, and some of which never could have been anticipated by the framers of the amendment, would unfortunately be productive of renewed litigation. But while those difficulties might have to be anticipated and considered in construing the new law, they would afford no color of license for disregarding its plain provisions, if within the pale of legislative power. I am free to say, the doubt in my mind has been whether the statute giving to a forfeited delivery bond the force and effect of a judgment, with all its conclusive and unimpeachable qualities,, was constitutional. Though the decisions of this court, in Reardon, ex parte, Eng. , and Ruddell vs. Magruder, ib, , sustaining its validity, were imperative upon me, I might still have thought the law constitutional for the only purpose appearing to-be contemplated by it, that is, the summary issuance of execution; and to this end the delivery bond could be likened to a general power of attorney, whereby the obligors authorized the sheriff to take and sell any property belonging to them for the purpose of paying a particular debt. And this would be leaving-out of view the various further questions, that might have to be determined, some of them being whether the statutory judgment on the delivery bond became a lien on the property of the principal and securities, and therefore constructive notice to subsequent incumbrancers and purchasers, thus laying the foundation, for a train of adjudications growing up into a law of property; whether it would be respected under the authentication act of' Congress, when sought to be made the foundation of an action, in another State: whether a writ of error would lie to it, as to the final judgment of a court; whether the same presumptions are to be indulged in its favor, as would be accorded to the judgment of a court of general jurisdiction; and lastly this question, whether it was such a merger or extinguishment, that no writ of error could afterwards lie to the judgment upon which the execution issued. According to the former delivery bond law, where there was a forfeiture by the non-delivery of the property, the plaintiff, not. choosing to sue out alias execution, might either bring an ordinary action at law upon the bond, or he might obtain a judgment at any time during the return term against the obligors, on summary motion and without notice or process. The power to render a judgment without notice, was for a long time doubted, as being contrary to natural justice. But then the only question was, whether the obligors in the bond might not contract for notice, either as a waiver or an acceptance of it in advance of the suit. Yet whether upon actual or constructive notice, there was, in such cases, the intervention of judicial power; the formality at least of a judicial consideration and sentence. Admitting that a party may well contract for notice of a judgment to be rendered against him by a court of competent jurisdiction, the difficulty here would still be, whether he can contract that his contract shall be a judgment. Because if this be law, the same principle might come to be greatly extended in its application to a variety of cases, whereby judgments would spring into being without the intervention of judicial power. The policy or propriety of constitutional legislation is no official concern of a judge; but regarding the judiciary as an independent and coordinate department of the government, it becomes his duty to maintain its authority and assert its jurisdiction, for wise purposes conferred by the organic law and for the time being entrusted to his keeping. I can understand that, as the conclusive effect of a judgment operates by way of estoppel, the General Assembly might, by legislation, attach the same consequences to a contract voluntarily entered into by the parties to it, though it could hardly be said to be of the same grade of dignity and solemnity; the difference being that in the one case the party is estopped by his own voluntary act, while the suitor at law has the right, with the aid of a court, to conclude his adversary by its judgment, against his will. Yet the received idea, the recognized definition of a judgment has always been that it is the exercise of judicial power. So that, to constitute a judgment, there must not only be a subject matter, about which an adjudication is sought, a plaintiff and defendant, whose rights are to be affected by it, but a judge also, or court through whom the law speaks, and who is authorized to declare its sentence. It was owing to this view that the case of Pickett & Gregg vs. Thruston, Eng. , the authority of which is now fully established, may not have been regarded as a safe precedent. Sincerely desiring to uphold the statute giving to forfeited delivery bonds the force and effect of judgments, I am enabled to yield to the authoritative opinions of my brother judges; but in doing so, feel it incumbent on me to characterize the statute referred to as a dangerous innovation in the law, and one which in principle cannot, consistently with the constitution, be any further extended. Consent being admitted as the sole foundation for these statutory judgments, I concur in the views expressed in The Trustees R. E. Bank vs. Sandefur, during the present term, which treats them as judgments for all purposes. Otherwise the most injurious consequences would follow; indeed, there ought to be no middle ground, if it could be avoided by any reasonable interpretation. And though this be done, many perplexing controversies may be expected to grow out of the statute. Demurrer overruled.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862716,"Marlow vs. Robins, Exr.","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker, delivered the opinion of the Court. '* Elijah D. Robins, in his life time, obtained a judgment before a-justice of the peace against William Marlow, and for the purpose of’ having execution against the real estate of the defendant, as provided for by the statute, Dig. ch. , filed a transcipt of such judgment in the Circuit Court clerk’s office; but before satifaction thereof was had, the plaintiff died, and his executor, John Robins,' sued out scire facias to revive the judgment in his name as such: executor! At the return term the defendant filed his plea to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, which plea, on motion of the plaintiff, was stricken out, and judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff. If this had been an original suit upon the contract sued upon, or upon the judgment rendered in the justice’s court thereon, there can be no doubt but that the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the same, because the amount in controversy is a matter of contract for some $, a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace. But this was a proceeding under the statute to reach the real estate of the debtor to satify a judgment rendered before a competent tribunal. The transcript, when filed, had under the statute the force and effect of a judgment rendered in the Circuit Court, as well to-bind the real estate by lien, as for process and sale under it, with-no reference, however, to any adjudication upon the cause of action, because that had already been adjudicated, but solely by the aid of the process of the Circuit Court to have satisfaction of the judgment,- Such being the object of the statute, such transcript when filed has the force and effect of a judgment in that court for that purpose. The object would, in cases like the present, fail unless the court has the power to keep its process alive by reviving the judgment, so as to enable the plaintiff to sue out process. It is true that, in a limited sense, a proceeding by sci. fa, is a suit upon which an issue may be formed, but that issue is substantially an -enquiry into the right of the plaintiff to have execution of the judgment, and is not an infringement upon the constitutional jurisdiction of the justices of the peace. The plea of the defendant was therefore insufficient, and upon demurrer should have been so adjudged; but as a matter of practice, as settled by this court in the case of Sanger vs. State Bank, at the present term, the objection could not be reached by a motion to strike the plea from the files!

1862641,"Cox, et al. vs. Morrow","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. Waiving any objection to the manner in which the questions of law, supposed to be involved in this case, were sought to be-reserved in the court below, we may assume, for the consideration of them here, that the facts (and which might readily have-been put into the shape of an agreed case, or a special verdict by the court below sitting as a jury), are as follows. In Asa Grant died in North Carolina, leaving a will, one clause of which is in these words, “ I further give unto my beloved wife, (Jemmima), one negro woman, known by the name of Harriett,- and her issue, during her natural life, and after her death the said negro woman Harriet and her issue, I give and bequeath-unto my beloved daughters, Clarissa Grant and Polly Grant, to be equally divided amongst them.” Jemmima Grant, the widow,. married Arthur Morrow;, and they moved to Tennessee, and from thence to Arks ansas, where she died in the year . Clarissa Grant married Eli Cox, in Tennessee, where they continue to live! Polly Grant married Hiram Williams and they moved to Texas, where she died in the year , leaving several children, the issue of their marriage, who are still living. In Williams sold and conveyed all his right, title and interest in the slaves in controversy to Pack and Cates, two 'of the appellants. From the time of his marriage with Jemmima Grant, Morrow always had possession of Harriet and her; issue, in right of his wife, and after her death, in , he continued to keep them in possession, never until then claiming them as his own. The negroes now in controversy pre Delia, who is the daughter of Harriet, and George the child of Delia. Upon the refusal of Morrow to surrender them, when demanded by the appellants, they sued him by action of replevin in the detinet. The defendant pleaded non-detinet, and a special plea asserting property in himself, with a traverse of property in the plaintiffs. The court sitting as a jury found upon the evidence, for the defendant, and he had judgment accordingly. . The action of replevin in the detinet, as now regulated by statute, is very similar to detinue, and may be said to lie in all cases where the plaintiff has the right of property, either general or special, and the right to immediate possession of a chattel taken or detained by the defendant, and differs from detinue in this; that in replevin the plaintiff obtains possession of the chattel in advance of the trial, and the defendant is supposed to be protected from the harshness of the remedy by the affidavit and bond of the plaintiff, and the short period of limitation prescribed for it! The plea of non-detinet (Digest, Title, Replevin, sec. ), puts in issue, not only the wrongful detention of the chattel, but the property of the plaintiff therein, and the special traverse pleaded here had no other effect than to tender a distinct and formal issue of the plaintiffs’ property, general or special, and right to possession at the time of suit brought. The action may be maintained, not only for the breach of a contract of bailment, but the allegation of bailment is fictitious and not traversable; so that replevin in the detinet extends to all cases where the property of one man is wrongfully in the possession of another, though that possession may have been, in its inception, both peaceable and lawful; as in the case of a bailment determinable by demand. It results from the nature of the action, which is to recover possession of a specific chattel, that if there be several part owners of it, they ought all to be joined as plaintiffs in the suit, and the non-joinder or misjoinder of parties in interest, who ought to be plaintiffs, is available in bar as well as in abatement. Although classed among actions ex delicto, and in theory the remedy for a tortious taking, replevin in the detinet differs essentially from actions ex delicto, where, for the injury, loss or destruction of personal property, owned by two or more persons in common, each part owner might consistently recover several damages, which would be commensurate with his interest in the chattel, though the chattel itself be not susceptible of division. We think, therefore, the plaintiffs were required, under the pleadings in this case, to show that, as against the defendant, they were the persons and the only persons having such right of property, as would entitle them to present possession of the slaves in controversy. . There is no where upon the record any allegation or proof of what was the law in North Carolina, the domicil of the testator when his will took effect in the year , or of Tennessee, where Williams and Polly Grant were married, or of the law of Texas, where Polly Williams resided at the time of her death, in ; all of which were legitimate subjects of proof, and might perhaps have been important in determining the rights of the parties; in the first instance, as to the character of the limitation, by way of executory devise, in the will of Asa Grant; in the second, for ascertaining what right Williams acquired, by his marriage, to the property in possession or expectancy of his wife; and lastly, whether by the law of Texas he succeeded at her death, as heir or distributee, to her property or right of property in the slaves. It must be assumed, as a settled proposition, that the courts of one State or sovereignty cannot judicially take notice of the laws of another and foreign State. They will by comity respect the foreign law, by protecting rights acquired under it, and will interpret and fulfill the obligation of contracts made in a foreign State, or with reference to its laws, but those laws are to be proved as facts upon which the claim or defence is based, though this rule of comity is subject to exceptions, where the right claimed under the foreign law is contrary to good morals, public policy or positive legislation in the country where it is sought to be enforced. The origin and peculiar relations of the American States involve the consideration of this subject, so liable to expand itself, in many perplexities. In Connecticut it seems, Hale vs. The New Jersey Steam Navigation Co., Conn. , that by statute, comity is carried to the extent of requiring her courts to notice judicially the statutes and the reports of decisions by the courts of other States of the Union; thus imposing upon them, as may readily be imagined, a most delicate as well as difficult duty. Notwithstanding the law of this State only relaxes the rule of evidence by providing, that the printed statute books of other States, purporting to be published by authority, shall be received as evidence of their contents, several cases are to be found in the reported decisions of this court, not the least Remarkable among which is Moody vs. Walker, Ark. , where counsel argued and the court referred, for the rule of decision, to what was understood to be the common or statute law of other States, without any admission or proof of it appearing to have been made in the inferior court. The courts of every State are bound to take judicial notice of the public laws and treaties of the United States; because, to the extent of the powers delegated to the federal government, and the subjects about which Congress may rightfully legislate, they form one country: while on the other hand, the life of the federal judiciary and its stronghold on the affections of the people depend upon respecting the reserved sovereignty of the States, and the due administration of their respective systems of law or local usage, under which private rights have vested. And unless with the anomalous exception of the civil law procedure in Louisiana, good policy has always dictated a conformity with the remedies furnished by the State laws. So that, in a case like the present, a court of the United States, otherwise acquiring jurisdiction by citizenship of the parties and value in dispute, would be enabled to know judicially the law of any State, and all modifications of it affecting the title to the slaves in controversy upon the facts here proven. And where two countries have the same origin, or were at one time associated, the courts of each are bound to take judicial notice of what the law was, when it was common to both. Thus, before their separation, the laws of Missouri extended over what is now Arkansas; and the courts of the new States, formed out of territory which belonged originally to one of the thirteen colonies, might have to look to the jurisprudence of the parent State, while its laws were in force over the entire territory. No such relation has ever existed between Arkansas and Carolina, Tennessee, or Texas. Our English ancestors, who colonized America, brought with them certain fundamental principles of the common law, such as the right of trial by jury, and the privilege of habeas corpus, which were essential to the enjoyment of civil liberty in England, as they are here. But it cannot be said that the great body of the common law, or the English Statutes, passed in aid of it, prevailed in the colonies, Black. Com. , and it cannot be presumed that it prevails now entire in any of the States of this Union. Even if the periods of its adoption could be ascertained, and a distinction taken between the common and statute law of England, we must know, as matter of legal history, that in every American State many of its leading features have been abrogated or changed by legislation, or essentially modified by local common law or usage. Of so much of the common law, as has been expressly adopted, or is tacitly recognized, the reported decisions of the courts in England ought to be regarded as its expositors. But even such adoption is partial, and disjointed: nor .are the decisions of the courts of this country, federal as well as State, in harmony with one another, or with those of the courts in England, upon a variety of purely common law questions. Even in cases involving commercial law, where#uniformity is so much to be desired, the decisions of each State, liable to be influenced by local considerations, not appreciable in another, cannot there be always safely followed as precedents. We need not look beyond the case under consideration for examples of such diversity of law. It is to be inferred from a provision contained in the Revised Statutes of North Carolina, vol. , ch. , sec. , passed in the year , and the decisions in that State, cited in Inge vs. Murphy, Ala. , that previous to the statutes referred to, a limitation of a remainder in a chattel after a life estate, like that contained in the'will of Asa Grant, would be effectual in North Carolina, by way of executory devise, but such limitation, if made by deed, would not have been valid, and the first taker would have the absolute estate. In Newton, ex’r vs. Cocke, ex'r. Eng. , where suit was brought here by one claiming to be a foreign executor, by virtue of the statute authorizing foreign executors and administrators, appointed in other States or territories of the United States, under the laws thereof, to sue in any of the courts of this State in their representative capacity with like effect as if they had been qualified under the laws of this State, in as much as the exemplification of the record of the will in Kentucky produced an oyer, did not afford any evidence of the appointment or qualification of the plaintiff, suing as executor, and there being no evidence of what the law of Kentucky was, and it could not be judicially recognized here, .this court felt itself called upon to presume that the law of England, as it stood at the time of the American revolution, prevailed in Kentucky, and to determine with apparent reference to it, the sufficiency of the evidence adduced to prove the appointment and qualification of the plaintiff, as executor. ■ And that course seemed unavoidable because the statute, by referring to the law of the State under which the executor derived his authority, excluded the idea that his qualification was to be tested by the law of this State. But apart from that or like exceptions., which might be occasioned by unguarded legislation, the courts of this State have no warrant for knowing judicially, and so administering the law of any other State or country foreign to this: and outside of the federal compact the States of this Union are to be regarded as foreign to each other. In the Territorial Legislature of Missouri, formally adopted and declared in force the common law of England of a general nature and all statutes of the British Parliament in aid of, or to supply the defects of the common law, made prior to the fourth year of James the first and of a general nature, and not local to that kingdom, and which common law and statutes were not contrary to the laws of that territory, and not repugnant to, nor inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the United States, as the rule of decision in that territory, until altered or repealed by the Legislature: and that statutory adoption has ever since continued to be in force under the territorial and State governments in Arkansas. Having thus introdnced the common law, without indeed the benefit of any of the judicious statutory reforms in England since the fourth year of James the first, when we administer that law, or what is left of it consistent with our own codifications, we do so, not because it is the law of England, but because it is part of our own law. It is therefore the law of the forum, to which they have submitted, that, in the absence of proof or admission of any other, is to determine the rights of the parties, no matter where the transactions occurred out of which those rights may spring. If the contract, for a breach of which suit is brought here, was made, or to be performed in another State, the law of that State, unless shown to be different, is presumed to be the same as our own. So that if either plaintiff or defendant, asserting or resisting a demand by suit, claimed that the law, peculiar to another State and applicable to the case, arising upon the facts proven, is different from that of the forum, he can only obtain the benefit of the foreign law, by making it a part 'of the case in evidence, . One of the questions mainly argued is, whether Williams succeeded as distributee to the choses in action of his deceased wife, or her chattels not reduced into possession during the coverture; and, supposing that he would be entitled to them, whether he or any assignee of his could bring- an action for their recovery, without taking out administration upon his wife’s estate and suing in a representative capacity. It will be conceded, that at the common law, the custom grew up for the husband to be entitled to receive from the ordinary the delegated power of administering upon the wife’s estate, and, becoming possessed of the goods as administrator, he was allowed to retain any surplus after the payment of the debts, without being required to make distribution to her next of kin. But neither the statute of Chas. , requiring administrators to make distribution; nor that of 29th of Chas. , exempting the husband, administering in right of his being such, from the duty of making distribution, and thus recognizing his legal right to'retain the surplus, ever had any force or operation in this State. And for the source of the husband’s right to administer, it would hardly be necessary to go back to the common law; superseded here by a statutory system of administration. . According to the Territorial law, Steel & McCamp, Dig., Title Administration, sec. , the husband or wife had the preference, before the next of kin, in administering upon the estate of the other; and that law, ib. Title Descents and Distributions, undertook to define accurately what interest the husband, surviving •his wife, should take in her real estate and slaves and personal estate in possession or in action, varied by the contingencies of her dying with or without issue. The Revised Statutes succeeding the Territorial law, re-enacted so much of it, Title, Administration, sec. , as required letters to be “granted to the representatives of the intestate who may apply for the same and are qualified, preferring first, the husband, or wife,.or one of the persons entitled by law to a distribution of t]ie intestate’s estate,” and though the language there used, would seem as if intended to apply to a state of Case, where by law the husband or wife surviving would succeed, as distributee, to the whole, or some part of the estate of the other, yet the statute of Descents and Distributions, as re-modelled by the revisors, negatives any such apparent intention. The first section of that chapter provides, that “when any person shall die having title to any real estate of inheritance or personal estate, not disposed of nor otherwise limited by marriage settlement, and shall die intestate as to such estate, it shall descend and be distributed in parceny to his kindred, male and female, subject to the payment of debts and the widow’s dower, in the following manner; first to children or their descendants in equal parts,” &c. In addition to that section, which would impose upon every administrator the duty of making distribution in accordance with it, because no exception is any where made in favor of the husband, the 7th section excludes all right of his by providing, that in the event of there being no children or their descendants, or any paternal or maternal kindred capable of inheriting, the whole estate shall go to the wife or husband of the intestate, and if there be no husband or wife, then to escheat. Though an examination at large of this subject, and especially as connected with a more recent enactment of December 8th, , enabling married women to become seized or possessed of property, real or personal, in their own right, while the former law, denying to them the general power of testamentary disposition, is retained in force, would disclose much of lamentable uncertainty and inconsistency, we have no discretion to construe away what appears to be the necessary result of the statute, whether so intended or not, Swift Digest . Reeves Dom. Rel. . Bunch's ad. vs. Hurst's adm'r Dessau. . Gough vs. Crane. Maryland Chy. Rep. , and must conclude that as the law now stands, the husband surviviving is entitled only to the preference in the administration of the estate of the wife, to enable him to recover her choses in action not disposed of or converted by him, and her personal property, not reduced to possession during coverture, for the purpose of paying her debts and making distribution of the surplus among her next of kin, to all of whom he is postponed in the succession. It is not pretended that two of the plaintiffs have sued here in a representative capacity; and assuming the law to be as we have stated it, we need not enquire further whether the husband, entitied as distributee of the wife’s estate, should nevertheless sue as her administrator; though we apprehend, that in such case he would come under the general rule, that in an action at law to recover the personal property of an intestate, the plaintiff must derive title by or through an administrator. . Conceding that Morrow, upon the death of his wife, who had the use of the negroes during her life, ceased to have any right to detain them from those entitled in remainder, the only remaining ground contended for in argument, upon which the present plaintiffs can expect to recover, is that the interest of Polly Grant in the negroes being a vested one, though in remainder, it became also, upon her marriage with Williams, transferred to and vested in him as absolutely as it was in her. The argument is, that the negroes were not choses in action, but property, the possession of which is always presumed to be with the title; that the possession of Morrow, in right of his wife and during the continuance of her life estate, was not adverse but consistent with the title of .those in remainder, and consequently, his possession was their possession, in like manner as if he had been a mere bailee. Plausible as that may appear, we apprehend the law to be Well settled, that marriage is a gift to the husband of personal property and choses in action of the wife, subject to the condition of his reducing them to possession during coverture, and that being accomplished the gift becomes absolute. By the marriage he becomes liable for her debts previously contracted, but such liability ceases upon the dissolution of the marriage by her death, if not before that time enforced by suit against him. The creditors of the wife would then be without remedy, unless they can resort to the separate property of the wife, or her chattels, or choses in action, not reduced to possession by the husband during coverture. According to the law in England and many of the United States, the husband surviving is entitled to all such property of the wife, which he is entitled to recover as her administrator, thus affording a fund for the payment of the debts of the wife whilst sole, and he retains the residue absolutely, succeeding to it in the character of husband. The’ husband during coverture, may sell or transfer by assignment, legal or equitable, for a valuable consideration, his wife’s choses in action, her chattels not reduced to possession, or, in more general terms, all her right to the present or future enjoyment of them; but if he die without making such disposition, the title to them has not been changed and they survive to the wife in preference to the administrator of the husband. So that the marriage does not operate transfer to the husband as an absolute gift, all the property to which the wife may be entitled, but only the power, by virtue of her right of property, of recovering or reducing it to his possession during the coverture; though indeed there may be a variety of vexed questions in practice, not affecting the theory, concerning what acts of the husband will constitute a reduction to possession. The later decisions in England not only hold that as against the wife surviving, the husband must have exercised his power of alienation during the coverture, but they go to the extent of making the validity of the husband’s alienation contingent upon a reduction to possession by the assignee during the coverture, not only in respect of sales of reversionary interests of the wife, which might not fall in, but of all choses in action, though at the time of assignment susceptible of being immediately reduced into possession; proceeding upon the ground that such being the extent of the husband’s power, his sale or assignment passes no greater authority than he himself had. If that apparent change in the common law is induced by a desire to enlarge the equitable claim of the wife to a settlement or possession for her support, similar to that policy which has prompted the recent statutes in this country, allowing the wife to take and hold a separate property, it may be defective because its benefits are precarious; but it has the merit of enabling a court to afford, in harmony with the common law, an adequate provision for the wife where she needs it, and without any of the jealousies and heart-burnings attending a separation of interests while the married relation subsists. But without reference to what may be termed a new feature in the law, it does seem that, upon old and established principles applicable to the present case, the husband, Williams, did not acquire any absolute property in the slaves in controversy. The two daughters had a vested remainder, which gave them a fixed right of future enjoyment, but the beneficial use of the slaves was in the mother during her life.’ The right of possession was with the temporary use, which Williams could not lawfully disturb, and as his wife died before the determination of the life estate, it was not possible that he, or any assignee of his could have reduced it to possession during coverture. At her death, without any previous disposition of them by him, his power to sell her choses in action, or rights of property in expectancy ceased, equally with his own right to recover them! It is true, those entitled in remainder to a specific chattel have an interest in preserving it, and may by injunction prevent its removal, or restrain those having the temporary use, from acts tending to injure or deteriorate it, and not necessary to a reasonable or judicious enjoyment. If destroyed they might have a remedy in trespass for damages, equivalent to the value of their interest in remainder; but there could be no remedy for those in remainder, inconsistent with the temporary right of possession in the person having the particular estate. Upon an examination of the cases cited for the appellant in support of the position, that Williams by his marriage acquired an absolute title to his wife’s estate in remainder in the slaves even though she died before the determination of the particular estate, and not subject to any contingency of the property being reducible into possession during the coverture, it will be found that the doctrine had its origin at a very early day in Virginia, the first reported case being that of Dade vs. Alexander, Wash. , and the sole reason given in the report of the case, was the statement of the President of the court of appeals; that such had been the constant decision of the old general court from the year , to the revolution, since confirmed in the then court of appeals in several cases, and that it had thus become a fixed and settled rule of property. In Wallace vs. Taliafero, Call., the same court, evidently embarrassed by having to adhere to another and inconsistent rule of the common law, yet respected the former decisions and upheld them upon the only intelligible ground, assigned by the President of the court, that he “had considered the principle as a fixed rule of property tending to quiet disputes.” The same remark is applicable to Robinson’s adm’r vs. Brock, Hen. & Munf. , and Wade vs. Boxley, Leigh . In Dummon vs. Sneed, Call. , the sale by the husband surviving, of a slave to which his wife had been entitled in remainder, was sustained on that ground, and also because he was empowered to sell as administrator. It was natural that the course of decisions on this subject in Virginia, the parent State, should have been adopted in Kentucky. The first case where it appears to have been followed is Pinkard vs. Smith, Littell Sel. cas. ; and there the court say, “Except for the purpose of ascertaining the proper parties to the present contest, it is not however material whether the husband was entitled to the remainder in the slaves, merely as surviving husband, or in virtue of his right to administer on the wife’s estate.” In Bank’s adm’r vs. Marksberry, Littell , the rule was distinctly asserted, though it may have been influenced by a statute of Kentucky there quoted, and the court enter into the same argument used here, to establish a difference between choses in action, which do not vest in the husband unless reduced into possession during the coverture, and his marital rights in the wife’s expectancies in remainder; an argument which implies that the rule sought to be introduced was an innovation, and not a familiar principle of the common law! It has been since followed in that State, Ewing vs. Handley, ib. . Jackson vs. Sublett, B. Mon. , though an attempt to reconcile all the cases, Tilford vs. Anderson, Dana . Turner vs. Davis, B. Mon. . Thomas vs. Kennedy, ib. . Hord vs. Hord, id. . Bowling adm’r vs Bowling, id. . Ring vs. Baldridge, ib. . Davenport vs. Brewett, ib. , bearing upon the rule contended for, would result in demonstrating it to be an exception, which the courts of that State have been endeavoring to limit in its application to the precise state of ease occurring in Dade vs. Alexander, where but for the exclusion of the creditors, if any, of the wife dum sola, it would be immaterial whether the husband surviving took as such, or as administrator of the wife. The case of Magil vs. Toland, Porter , stands upon its special circumstances, as would appear from the subsequent case of Bibb vs. McKinley, ib. , and decides only that the possession of the guardian is the possession of the ward. The case of Pitts vs. Curtis, Ala. , (not within reach) has also been cited for the appellants,but as referred to and qualified in Broome vs. King, ib. , it appears to have been based solely upon the authority of Dade vs. Alexander and Banks vs. Marksberry. And in this connection it is worthy of remark that the doctrine of some of the later cases in England, Hornsby vs. Lee, Mad. Chy. . Parden vs. Jackson, Russ. , and Honnor vs. Morton, Russ. , before alluded to, has been formally recognized by the court of appeals in Virginia, Browning vs. Headley, Robinson , though it may be subject to their peculiar distinction between the wife’s remainder in a chattel and her choses in action. On the whole, we conclude that, whatever may be the result in a suit between other parties, or under a different state of proof, according to the case made by the record before us, upon the death of Polly Williams, her estate in the slaves in controversy devolved upon her next of kin, according to the statute of distributions, and would be recoverable by her administrator for their benefit, and consequently two of the plaintiffs, claiming as assignees of the husband, have failed to establish any legal title in themselves.

1862621,"Yell, Governor, &c., use of Conant & Co. vs. Outlaw et al.","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court* The peculiar state of case, upon which the question here to be determined arises, is as follows : Upon the remanding of this cause, after the decision of it by this court, reported in Eng. , various amended pleas were interposed by the several defendants, to which the plaintiffs replied, and upon which issues of fact were formed, properly triable by a jury. We do not now consider or determine, whether those issues were material or immaterial, or the legal sufficiency of any of the pleas to bar the action; because that enquiry is not now involved, and the plain-' tiffs having treated the pleas as sufficient, we may intend that they were so, and that they were amended in accordance with the intimations contained in the opinion of this court, before cited. A reference to that opinion and the previous report of the same case, Outlaw vs. The Governor, Ark. , will explain the nature of the suit which was against the principal and securities on the official bond of an administrator, and the various defences interposed. Upon the last trial of the cause a jury was empam neled and sworn to try the issues joined. There were also issues upon pleas of nul liel record, which, being submitted to the coart, were found in favor of the defendants: “And thereupon,” as stated in the record, “the plaintiffs excepted to the finding of the court upon said issues, and immediately filed their bill of exceptions in respect thereof, which is signed, sealed and ordered to form a part of the record herein. Whereupon the plaintiff refusing to proceed further in the cause, it is ordered by the court that the jury empanneled in the cause be discharged.” Then follows the judgment of the court, that the plaintiffs take nothing by their writ, and that the defendants go thence without day and recover their costs, &c. It appears from the bill of exceptions that the plaintiffs offered in evidence certain records which are set out, to prove the recovery of judgment in the original suit by Conant & Co. against the administrators, and which was all the evidence adduced in the cause. The finding of the court, that there was no such record, was without doubt, a gross error; the issues and the evidence being the same in respect of which this court decided, when the cause was here before, ( Eng. ,) that the court below had correctly found in favor of the plaintiffs: nor would an enquiry be tolerated of an after discovered variance, if any such be alleged. And inasmuch as those issues were triable by the court itself, not sitting as a jury, having a plain duty to find the evidence sufficient, which the previous decision of this court had made a foregone conclusion, there could be no hesitation in reversing the judgment, if that was the only question; disregarding the point argued for the defendants upon the authority of The State Bank vs. Conway, Ark. , where there was an exception to the finding of the court sitting as a jury, certifying the evidence without raising any question of law. But that error of the court did not, in our opinion, warrant the plaintiffs in stopping the cause there, and refusing to proceed any farther with it. It is a clear proposition that a plaintiff would not be entitled to judgment when there is a good plea in unanswered, Cole vs. Wagnon, Ark. . Boyer vs. Robinson, Eng. ; though a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff will not.be reversed for want of a plea, which was the fault of the defendant. Shropshire vs. McLain, ib. . The question is, whether a judgment is final, so that a writ of error will lie to it, which disposes of only a part of the issues in the cause. In Woodruff et al. vs. The State, Ark. , the defendants below had pleaded several pleas; to one of which a demurrer was interposed on behalf of the State, issues of fact being made up on the others. The demurrer was sustained in the court below, and by agreement, the other issues awaited the decision of the Supreme Court on the demurrer; but the nature of that agreement, and the judgment consequent upon it, not necessarily noticed in that decision, will appear in the subsequent report of the same case, Eng. , where the question arose whether the agreement had not been violated after the remanding of, the cause upon reversal. The agreement was to the effect, that the court below, in case it sustained the demurrer to one of the pleas, should proceed by consent of parties to render final judgment in favor of the State, not only upon the demurrer, but upon the other pleas, to which issues of fact had been joined. Such judgment was accordingly rendered, and unless that hadbeendone, we apprehend this court would not have adjudicated the cause without an oversignt. The result was that the defendants below staked every thing on obtaining a reversal of the judgment, which they had agreed should be final, if against them upon the demurrer; because if the judgment had been affirmed, the cause could not have been remanded for the trial of the other issues of fact. In the report of the case last cited, the court say, “It is not in the power of a party to single out any one issue, even by the most solemn contract of record, and submit it to the consideration of the Supreme Court, so as to elicit the opinion of the Supreme Court, upon the law or the fact of that particular issue. Such a judgment would not be final; as not embracing all the issues in the case; and, consequently, it could not become the subject of an appeal or writ of error. The real object of the parties was to take the opinion of the Supreme Court upon the question of law arising upon the demurrer to the second plea; but in order to receive the benefit of that decision it became absolutely-necessary that the Circuit Court should pass upon all the issues joined.” The language of the opinion quoted is applicable to the present case and decisive of it, though the position of the parties is inverted. In the case of The State vs. Woodruff et al., the defendants, if they wished to take the opinion of the Supreme Court upon any one of their defences, were bound either to have withdrawn the pleas upon which issues of fact had been joined, or consented that final judgment might go upon them in favor of the plaintiff, so as to mature the whole case for the decision of the appellate court, because the record could not remain in both courts at the same time for adjudication: otherwise causes would be determined by picemeal, and there would be an end of the • salutary rule of law, the design of which is to make an end of the litigation, that the judgment concludes the parties as to every matter examinable at law, in support or avoidance of the right asserted, whether urged there or not. In this case, where the judgment of the court below, in favor of the defendants, upon one good plea, going to the whole cause of action, was sufficient to bar it, and the plaintiff could not force the defendants, having the right to plead several matters, to withdraw their other defences, the only course left for the plaintff was to proceed with the trial, and obtain or submit to a verdict of a jury upon the issues of fact, which they had been sworn to try. The most favorable construction for the plaintiffs, that can be put upon the record entry, is that, during the progress of the trial, they elected to take a non-suit, though such may not have been their intention. Since with us courts have no power to order a peremptory non-suit, it is no answer to say that the plaintiffs were compelled to go out of court by an erroneous decision upon one of the issues, which, if it had been correct, would have barred a recovery and put an end to the case. If the plaintiff goes out of court by his own voluntary act, though under a misapprehension, no writ of error lies to reverse the judgment consequent upon it. He might move to set aside a non-suit occasioned by surprise or alarm at some interlocutory decision of the court, or if he persisted in going on to verdict and judgment, might ask for a new trial upon the ground that the court had erred: but even in such case he would have to satisfy the court that but for its erroneous decision, he was prepared with evidence to entitle him to a recovery upon all the issues. The decision of the court therefore, is that the writ of error be dismissed. Upon this, see Peet vs. McGrace, Wend. . Watson vs. Anderson, Hardin Rep. . Van Worneer vs. Mayor of Albany, Wend. . Vestal vs. Burditt, Black. . It is proper to say, that in the decision at a former day of the present term, upon demurrer to a plea in bar of this writ of error, because the plaintiffs had prayed and prosecuted an appeal without supersedeas from the same judgment; that was the only question presented, and the record itself was not before the court.

1862676,Allis vs. Bender,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott, delivered the opinion of the Court. The declaration was in debt upon a writing obligatory, averring that it was made by the defendant, Allis, payable to the plaintiff, Bender, “by the style of D. Bender, & Co.” At the return term, after oyer granted, Allis pleaded that he did not make the writing obligatory, payable to the plaintiff, Bender, by the style of D. Bender & Co., as alleged in the declaration, but that he made it payable to said Bender and one James A. Henry, as partners, by the name, style, description and firm of D. Bender & Co., and of which he put himself upon the country. A demurrer was interposed, and the causes assigned were : 1st, that the plea was not sworn to; 2d, that it concluded to the country, and not with a verification; and 3d, that it was frivolous. The demurrer was sustained and final judgment was rendered for the plaintiff below, and the cause brought here by writ of error. According to the course of decisions in this court, the demurrer did not reach the first objection. To do this a motion to strike out was necessary. (Wilson & Turner vs. Shannon & wife, Eng. R. . Hardwick et al. vs. Campbell, &c., Eng. R. . Mayor & Aldermen of Little Rock vs. State Bank, Eng. R. . State Bank vs. Ward, Eng. R. . Knott vs. Clements ad. Ark. R. .) The averment in the declaration that the writing obligatory in question, was made payable to the plaintiff, Bender, by the style of D. Bender ¿¡ Co., was a material and traversable one, according to the decisions in the cases of Bower et al. vs. State Bank, Ark. , and Nicholay et al. vs. Kay, Eng. R. . And although, in general, it is the property of the plea of the “general issue,” in any form of action, to deny all the facts set forth in the declaration, and to put the plaintiff on proof of every essential fact alleged by him, it was expressly ruled, in the last mentioned case, that the plea of non est factum would not traverse an allegation like this in question, and that that plea putting in issue only the sealing and delivery of the writing obligatory, admitted as true all the other material allegations in the declaration. From this then it follows that the allegations in question could only have been specially ha versed. This was the object contemplated by the plea in question; the legal sufficiency only of which, and not its form, or want of verification by affidavit, is brought in question by the demurrer. As a special traverse, designed for the denial of only one of the several facts alleged in the declaration, although it contained other matter, and was otherwise objectionable upon special demurrer, before that was abolished, it properly concluded to the country. And it would have been equally good in substance, had it concluded with a verification, ( Saunders , a. b. n. (,) tendering as it would have done, a material issue and admitting; as the plea did, the truth of all the other allegations contained in the declaration. The plea was therefore not frivolous, but good in substance, and the demurrer should have been overruled.

1862612,"Moore & Cail, adm'r. of Irvin vs. Anders","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court! The facts of this case, necessary to a correct understanding of it, may be thus stated. On the 29th of May, , Reason and John T. Bowie executed a bond with covenant, to make title to one Blackmore, for certain tracts of land in Phillips county. The bond was in the penal sum of $,, and after reciting, that the Bowies had that day sold the lands therein described to said Blackmore, his heirs and assigns, for the consideration of $,; that is to say $ cash in hand, and the residue in two installments of $ each, one due on the 1st of January, , and the other on the 1st of January, , it was conditioned to be void if they should well and truly make or cause to be made to Blackmore his heirs or assigns, a good and sufficient warranty deed, in fee simple, for the lands therein before described, so soon as the final payment of said sums of money should be made, or as soon thereafter as might be reasonably convenient. The bond for title was acknowledged and recorded, on the day of its date, in the office of the recorder of deeds and mortgages for Phillips county. Black-more paid the first note for $, due on the 1st of January, , and Reason Bowie, to whom the second note for like amount was made payable on the 1st of January, , assigned it to Irvin, to whom Blackmore afterwards made payment of $, upon it. The residue of this note with interest remaining unpaid. Ir.vin sued Blackmore, and on the 19th of November, , obtained judgment against him on the corfimon law side of the Phillips Circuit Court for the amount due. Execution was issued upon this judgment on the 27th of March, , under which the lands in question were advertised and sold on the 21st of April following, and Irvin became the purchaser of them, for the sum of $. Anders and Horner being creditors of Blackmore, obtained a judgment against him in the same court, on the 20th of November, , for $, upon which an execution was issued, and under it the same lands were advertised and sold as the property of Blackmore on the 1st of April, , and Anders became the purchaser for the sum of $, and by virtue of such purchase obtained possession of the lands. On the 27th of February, , Irvin exhibited his bill against the two Bowies, Blackmore and Anders, alleging the foregoing facts, and farther representing that Anders had become,insolvent and non-resident: that the judgment against him in favor of the complainant remained wholly unsatisfied, unless it be entitled to a credit of $, the amount of his bid at execution sale for the lands in question; and that the Bowies refused to make a deed for the lands until Blackmore had complied by the payment of the purchase money therefor, according to the condition of their bond and covenant to him for title. The bill prayed that the complainant’s purchase of the lands under execution be set aside and held for nought; that Anders be required to pay to the complainant the full amount of his judgment at law against Blackmore, or in default thereof, that the lands be made subject and decreed to be sold by a commissioner of the court for the satisfaction of the same: that the entire interest and claim of all the parties to the suit should vest in the purchaser of the lands at such sale, and that the same operate as an acquittance and release to the Bowies, from all obligation under their bond for title to convey the same. The bill, on the demurrer of Anders, was adjudged insufficient and dismissed for want of equity. The main question argued in this case, is settled by the decision of this court in Smith vs. Robinson et al. Ark. . When the Bowies sold the lands to Blackmore, and gave him their bond for title on payment of the purchase money, the transaction was, in all essential features, a security for the payment of the purchase money; the same, in effect, as if they had made him a deed and taken a mortgage back to attain the same end, which the parties had in view. In the case referred to, the origin and history of this species of conveyance, peculiar to the new States, is explained. Under the land system adopted by the United States, inchoate equitable titles were derived in various ways, from the government through its land officers. Until the emanation of patents, often suspended or delayed for years, it would be impossible for the owner of land so situated, to make title upon a sale of it. Bonds or covenants for title were therefore resorted to as a matter of necessity. The policy of the country having always been to facilitate the transfer of real estate, it often happened that the same tract of land would be successively sold in the same manner, where none of the vendors or purchasers had the legal title. So the custom grew up of selling lands by means of a bond or covenant of the vendor,, conditioned to make conveyance of the legal title when procured from the United States, and where the sale was upon credit, the further condition was inserted to make title upon the payment of the purchase money. This informal conveyance was something more than an executory agreement to sell; it imported a present sale, which passed the ownership and beneficial interest in the land, to the purchaser, usually accompanied with possession, or the right of possession as against the vendor, being an equivalent for the interest of the purchase money. Such an estate or interest in land was recognized at an early day by territorial legislation as a “seizin in equity.” Steele & McCamp. Dig. Title, Administration, sec. ; ib. Title, Conveyances, sec. ; ib. sec. . Rev. Stat. Title, Administration, sec. . Ib. Title, Execution, sec. . Provision was made for the recording of such instruments, whereby they became constructive notice of title; Rev. Stat. Title, Conveyances, sec. . The lien reserved by means of them to the vendor, has none of the odious characteristics of the vendor’s equitable lien for the unpaid purchase money, where having conveyed the legal title, acknowledging the receipt of the purchase money, he ought not to be heard to assert it against any subsequent purchaser or incumbrancer, without clear and unequivocal proof of actual notice.. On the contrary the vendor, in this mode of conveyance, does not expressly refuse to part with the legal title; and whether by the terms of the contract the payment of the purchase money be a condition precedent, or dependant upon the final execution of the deed, the result is the same. It makes no difference whether the bond for title be recorded or not. If recorded, it becomes notice: if not on record, that circumstance would, of itself be sufficient to put any subsequent purchaser or incumbrancer upon enquiry; because an examination of the record would show title out of the vendor. And unlike the equitable lien of the vendor, who has parted with the legal title, if notes be taken for the purchase money with any additional or personal security, the fact of the vendor, who gives only a bond or covenant for title, taking such additional security, is no waiver of the lien, where it is expressly reserved by the terms of the contract, so that the payment of the purchase money, from whatever source it may be derived, is to be a condition precedent, or a simultaneous act with the execution of the deed. Although in Brown vs. Morrison, Ark. , this distinction is not clearly stated, it necessarily follows, from the decision there, upholding the lien of Brown, the vendor, notwithstanding he had taken the notes of Cole, with personal security. As the court there said, “ His covenant only binds him to convey upon the reception of the purchase money.” But the appellee insists, that whatever lien the original vendor may have had, it is not assignable, and did not pass to Irvin by the assignment of the note to him, but that when Bowie transferred the note for value received, he got his money, being ail that he was entitled to ask, and that the condition being accomplished, no further act remained for him to do, but to execute the conveyance. Again, it would be sufficient for the decision of this point to refer to the opinion in Smith vs. Robinson; because whenever we assimilate the sale of land, by means of a bond or covenant conditioned to make title on payment of the purchase money, to a conveyance and mortgage back to secure the same end, the usual incidents of a mortgage attach to the transaction, and the rights of the parties, growing out of it, are to be governed by analogous rules. The weight of authority no doubt is, that the equitable lien of the vendor is personal to him, and is not, unless under some peculiar equitable circumstances, assignable. We decline going into any such question, because it is not presented here, and is only noticed by way of contrast with the description of lien now under consideration: clearly the lien, under a bond for title on payment of the purchase money, being expressly reserved by contract, tantamount to a mortgage security for the benefit of the vendor, and the note for the purchase money transferrable like any other chose in action made assignable by law, the assignment of the note tacitly carries with it the vendor’s lien by way of mortgage security, and as an incident to the debt. The value of the note, as a negotiable instrument in the hands of the vendor, would be impaired, if the security could not accompany a transfer of it to an assignee. The right of the purchaser to a conveyance depends upon the payment of the note by him, or by some one who has become subrogated to his rights, as was the case in Smith vs. Robinson, and not upon the fact that the vendor has received the money upon the note, if it be still outstanding against the purchaser; and this would be so, though he had endorsed it without recourse, or though he should become discharged by the laches of the holder as at'the law merchant, or by his failure to pursue the maker with due diligence to insolvency under the statute of assignments, or supposing the assignor’s liability upon the ""contract of assignment to become barred by limitation. That the vendor’s lien, when thus reserved by the terms of the contract, is assignable in those States, where this mode of conveyance by bond for title prevails, see Tanner vs. Hicks, Smedes & Marsh. . Roper vs. McCook, Ala. . Norvell vs. Johnson, Humph. . Though it is remarkable, as an examination of the cases in the western States would show, that the two descriptions of lien, though so entirely dissimilar, are often confounded. At the time the lands were sold upon execution of the judgment at law obtained by Irvin against Blackmore, the lien of the judgment under the statute had expired; but the sale under the junior judgment of Anders & Horner, under which Anders purchased, was within three years from its rendition: and although the sale of land under a junior judgment only passes the title of the defendant, subject to the lien of any prior judgment in force, yet the lien of Irvin’s judgment had ceased to be in force when he purchased under it, and the judgment creditors being entitled to no equitable preferences as against each other, but having to stand or fall according to their legal priorities, it follows that if the lands had been the absolute property of Blackmore, as between the two purchasers it is clear that they would belong to Anders. And it is argued for him, that if Irvin stands in the place of the original vendor, then by his purchase of the lands under his judgment against Blackmore, there was a merger of the equitable title of the judgment debtor into the legal title held or represented by Irvin, whereby Irvin, having acquired both the legal and equitable estate, has no cause of complaint, and is not entitled to any relief. We apprehend that under our statute, Digest, Title, Execution, sec. , which subjects to execution “all real estate, whether patented or not, whereof the defendant or any person for his use was seized, at law or in equity, on the day of the rendition of the judgment, order or decree, whereon execution issued, or at any time thereafter;” that Blackmore had such an interest in the lands as was subject to execution upon any judgment rendered against him. Even if he were not in possession, or had not paid any portion of the purchase money, yet according to Smith vs. Robinson, the law regards the purchaser under an executed contract of sale, evidenced by a bond for title, as the real owner of the land, subject to an incumbrance for the purchase money, and occupying the position of a mortgager, who has divested himself of the naked legal title as a security for a debt, and whose equitable or beneficial estate would, without doubt, be bound by the lien of a judgment, and subject to execution to satisfy it. The State vs. Lawson, Eng. . In order to present this case most strongly in favor of Anders, let it be supposed that Bowie,the original vendor, had obtained the senior judgment at law for the purchase money against Blackmore, and had caused his interest in it to be sold under execution before the lien of the judgment had expired. In such case, it would follow from the argument urged on behalf of Anders, that the interest of Blackmore was forever divested, and that neither he nor any vendee of his, or purchaser under execution against him, who had thereby become subrogated to his rights, could have been entitled to redeem. The enquiry, what effect the sale of the mortgaged premises upon execution of a judgment at law for the mortgage debt would have, according to the laws of this State, upon the mortgager’s equity of redemption, alluded to in the case of Price vs. The State Bank, at July term, , might be the subject of an extended examination. We have no statute regulating the mode, sometimes resorted to elsewhere, of barring the equity of redemption by sale under a power; nor is the consideration of this case affected by any question, how far the equity of redemption of the vendee, under a bond for title, may be barred by a stipulation in the instrument, making the time of payment the essence of the contract, or whereby a forfeiture is agreed upon, in the event the purchase money be not punctually paid. Avoiding any such considerations, which could only be adverted to by way of illustration, it must suffice to express our opinion of the law, as applicable to the particular case before us, and upon the facts stated. The substance of the statute concerning “mortgages,” is set out in Price vs. The State Bank. Upon any fair and equitable interpretation of that statute, our opinion is against the power of the mortgagee to foreclose the equity oí redemption, by a sale of the mortgaged premises, under execution of a judgment at law, for the debt secured by the mortgage. It might be questionable whether such a sale, where the purchase is made by a third person, would not operate to transfer to him the entire claim of the mortgagee upon the land, that is, the right to have a foreclosure, or what is equivalent, to receive the benefit resulting from the redemption. And it might be true that a third person, purchasing at such sale, would become subrogated, by operation of law to the mortgager’s right to redeem. So that the purchaser, in such case, might possibly acquire the title, as against both the plaintiff and defendant in the execution. But a purchase of the mortgaged premises by the plaintiff in execution, that is to say, the holder of the mortgage debt could not bar the equity of redemption subsisting in the mortgager: and in no event, whether the purchase be made by the plaintiff in execution, or by a stranger, would it have the effect to bar the equity of redemption, acquired from the mortgager by an intermediate purchaser or incumbrancer, whose right to redeem would not be cut off by execution of the judgment at law, to which they were not parties. As there ought to be a mutuality of rights, it follows, that the mortgagee is not precluded, by his purchase of the mortgager’s estate under execution at law, from going into equity under the statute, to have a foreclosure, thereby opening the foreclosure, and letting in all the equities of the mortgager, even if any doubt before existed concerning them. We have seen that Irvin’s purchase under his judgment, after the lien of it had expired, was a nugatory act, and of itself gave him no rights at law as against Anders, who claimed under Blackmore. But his right, derived by assignment from the vendor, to subject to the payment of the original purchase money, the land in question, whether held by Blackmore or any one claiming under him, and who of necessity acquired it with notice oí the condition upon which the title was to emanate from the vendor, continued unimpaired, unless we held that the mortgagee, suing at law, is precluded thereby from having a foreclosure. Finally, it is argued for Anders, that by the law in force, five years being the limitation upon a writing obligatory, and Irvin’s bill of complaint not having been exhibited until six years after the writing obligatory assigned to him, fell due, his right to subject the land in question to the payment of it, is barred in equity by analogy to the statute at law; and that the judgment at law, obtained by Irvin against Blackmore, and in a distinct proceeding, is no judicial ascertainment of the debt as against Anders. Until the decisions of this court, beginning with Dickerson vs. Morrison, Eng. , followed in Davis vs. Sullivan, ib. , and Bird vs. Smith, ib. , it 'was doubtful whether, until the passage of the act of December, , there was any statute affecting the limitation to actions on writings obligatory, other than the presumption of payment arising after the lapse of ten years, according to sec. , of the Revised Statutes of ; but those decisions did authoritatively settle the law, as now claimed for the appellee. But for the reason that he is not affected by the independent judgment against Blackmore, he can claim no immunity from it. No doubt exists, under the statute of limitations applicable to these transactions, that the right of the mortgagee to assert and enforce his lien upon the land by a bill to foreclose, would not be barred until ten years from the time the right to foreclose accrued: because he would have that time within which to bring ejectment at law, and for aught that appears, the ¡possession of the vendee, being consistent with his contract of purchase, by no possibility could a title by length of adverse possession have become matured as against the vendor, within a shorter period. That the vendor, who gives a bond for title, may bring ejectment on failure of the vendee to comply with the condition of the bond by the payment of the purchase money, is fully established by Brown vs. Morrison & Sullivan, and Fears vs. Merrill, Eng. : nor is any notice to quit necessary, according to Smith vs. Robinson. By analogy therefore to the limitation at law, we hold that the bill in this case, to subject the lands in'question to the payment of the original purchase money, was well brought within ten years from the maturity of the writing obligatory, executed by Blackmore, for its payment; and so the converse of this would be law; that Anders, if under different circumstances it had become important to his rights, would have had a like period, within which to redeem. Upon the facts alleged in the bill, the complainant, Irvin, was entitled to the relief prayed for. The decree of the chancellor is therefore reversed, and the cause will be remanded with instructions to overrule the demurrer, and for further proceedings.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862666,Blakeney vs. Ferguson et al.,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Scott delivered the opinion of the Court. On the first day of the April term of the Pulaski-Circuit-Court, the appellant became the purchaser of the land in controversy. It was sold as the property of Moses Ferguson, by virtue-of an execution, against him and one Michael Hogan, in favor of one Nathaniel Midgett, upon a judgment obtained in May, . During that term the appellant obtained a writ of possession upon his motion, to which Moses Ferguson appeared; From the judgment of the Pulaski Circuit Court granting the writ of possession, an appeal was taken to this court, where .in the month of October, , the judgment of the Pulaski court was-affirmed. ( Eng. R. .) In the meantime, in the month of August, , Mary Ferguson, as widow, and Moses Ferguson and others, as heirs of Joseph Ferguson, deceased, filed a bill in chancery against the appellant and the heirs of Sampson Gray, deceased, alleging that on the 5th of November, , the sheriff of Pulaski county, in the then Territory of Arkansas, sold the land in controversy, in due course of law, for taxes, to the said Sampson Gray, and executed to him the prescribed certificate of purchase; that Gray sold, the land to the said Joseph Ferguson for the sum of $-- “in-hand, paid by the said Joseph to the said Sampson,” with the express understanding and agreement that he, Gray, would convey the land by deed as soon as he should himself receive one from the sheriff in pursuance of law and in accordance with his certificate; but that Gray departed this life before receiving such deed-from-the sheriff, and before making one to the said Joseph Ferguson: that by virtue of the aforesaid sale and agreement, Joseph Ferguson took possession of the land, and used and occupied it by putting his son, Moses Ferguson, in the possession and quiet enjoyment of the same: that Moses had continued to hold-that possession, without adverse claim from any one, up to the - 2d of April, , when the said Joseph departed this life, and' that since the death of Joseph, Moses had continued in- the possession by the consent and permission of the heirs and adminisirator of the said Joseph: that in April, , the land had been, sold by execution as the property of Moses, and that the appellant Blakeney became the purchaser, who had received a deed .for it from the sheriff of Pulaski county, conveying all the title .and interest of the said Moses. The bill, upon these alleged facts, proceeds to pray the court to decree to the heirs at law of Joseph Ferguson, a valid and sufficient •title in law and equity to the tract of land in question, upon condition that they allot to the widow, one third part as a dower estate, and convey to the appellant, Blakeney, an undivided sixth part of the residue, or pay him an equivalent in money, the said ■sixth part being the alleged interest of Moses in the land. To this bill, Blakeney interposed a demurrer assigning for cause; 1st, That there was no equity upon the face of the bill. 2d? That complainants showed no title to the land, but a parol agreement between Gray and Joseph Ferguson, which is forbidden by the statute of frauds. 3d, No facts to take the case out of the statute. 4th, No money paid in part performance. 5th, That the agreement was without consideration and void. The Circuit Court overruled the demurrer, and rendered a final •decree in favor of complainants as to Blakeney, and an interlocutory one as to .the heirs of Gray, who were duly summoned, but made default. Blakeney appealed to this court, and upon a hearing here, ¡at the January term, , it washeld that the facts •alleged were .sufficient to take the case out of the statute of frauds, but that the allegations were not sufficient to show title in Gray. And the decree appealed from was reversed, and the cause remanded to be proceeded with according to the principles of equity, and not inconsistent with the opinion herein delivered. ( Eng. R. .) While this cause was pending in the Circuit Court, and immediately after the decision of this court, in October, , affirming the judgment of the Pulaski Circuit Court, in the matter of the writ of possession, the same complainants, Mary Ferguson and others, filed their petition in the Pulaski Circuit Court, alleging that they had, on the 28th of August, , filed the before mentioned bill of complaint, .and praying that a copy thereof, which they exhibited, might be taken as a part of their petition: that the defendants had been served with process of subpoena; that the land in question had been sold as aforesaid, and purchased by Blakeney; that the latter had obtained an order of possession; that the order had been appealed from to this court, where the judgment of the Circuit Court in the premises had been affirmed. And upon these alleged facts, verified by affidavit, prayed that the appellant, Blakeney, should be enjoined from all further proceedings with his writ of possession (the award of which had been so affirmed by this court,) until their bill aforesaid should be finally heard and determined. This prayer was resisted by Blakeney, but his resistance was of no avail, and the injunction was awarded. Afterwards he interposed a demurrer to the petition and assigned for cause: 1st, That there was no equity upon the face of the petition. 2d, That it was an attempt to re-investigate a matter already determined by this court, without any showing of further facts or new matter. 3d, That the petition alleged no title to the land, but set up a parol agreement with regard thereto. 4th, That no sufficient facts were alleged to take the case out of the statute of frauds. 5th, That no gum of money was alleged to have been paid in part performance. 6th, That upon the face of the petition, the alleged agreement appears to have been made without consideration, and is therefore void, irrespective of the statute. 7th, That inasmuch as there is failure of any allegation of title, there is no ground ppon which to base partition. 8th, That if on the other hand, title be alleged, then there is an adequate remedy at law. Upon argument, the demurrer was overruled, and the appellant, Blakeney, declining to plead to, or answer the petition, the injunction was perpetuated, and Blakeney appealed to this court, where upon a hearing at the January term, , the decree of the Pulaski Circuit Court, perpetuating the injunction, was reversed, and the cause remanded to be proceeded with, according to the principles of equity, and not inconsistent with the opinion therein delivered, ( Eng. R. .) •In the meantime, the same complainants, at the October term, , of the Pulaski Circuit Court, had filed an amended bill as a substitute for their original bill, held bad on demurrer by this court, at the January term, , alleging with exceeding minuteness the peformanee of every pre-requisite for a valid sale for taxes under the territorial statute, from its inception up to and including the issuance of the certificate of purchase to Sampson Gray in the year : that in , before obtaining the sheriff’s deed in pursuance of the certificate, Gray sold the land to Joseph Ferguson for the sum of fifty dollars, and received the money therefor; and agreed that he would procure such deed and convey all his right, title and interest in the land to the said Joseph, and at the same time placed the latter in possession thereof, in pursuance of this contract: that no person offered to redeem the land within the time prescribed by the statute: that Gray having departed this life before receiving such deed, made none to Joseph: that the representatives of Gray, after his death delivered to Joseph the certificate of purchase, under which and in pursuance of the contract of sale to him aforesaid, he continued to hold possession: that in , Joseph placed his son Moses in possession of the land as his tenant, who occupied as such until the death of Joseph, in : that ever since then Moses has held the possession, by the consent and permission of the legal representatives and heirs at law of Joseph, subject to the rights of the latter, and of the widow; with the understanding and agreement that he would yield possession whenever required for the purpose of assigning dower and making partition. The bill then sets out the levy and sale, as the property of Moses, and the purchase by, and conveyance to the appellant, Blakeney, by the sheriff, Borden, of all the right, title and interest of Moses. And tothealleged end, that the title to the land in controversy may be quieted and vested in the proper owner thereof, and partition be made, concludes with a prayer that the court will decree a valid and sufficient title in law and equity to the heirs at law, upon condition that they assign dower to the widow, and convey to Blakeney one-sixth part of the residue, or pay him an equivalent in money, if actual partition be impracticable. In February, , Blakeney answered this amended bill, denying every material allegation as to the sale of the land for taxes; and the subsequent sale by Gray, to Joseph Ferguson, and the latter’s possession under the alleged contract of sale: pleads that if any such sale and contract were made, it was within the statute of frauds, and no sufficient facts to take it without the statute: denies the delivery of the certificate of purchase to Joseph Ferguson, or that he ever held under it; admits that Moses Ferguson held the quiet possession of the land in , and before and afterwards, up to and after the commencement of this suit, but denies that he held as tenant of Joseph during the lifetime of the latter, or by consent and permission of the complainants since, but avers that he held it as his own absolute property; avers that in or , Moses, then in possession, offered to sell the land to the respondent, and was regarded in the community as the owner', and that nothing to the contrary was ever heard until respondent’s purchase at sheriff's sale; avers that the owner of the land, when it was sold for taxes, resided in the Territory of Arkansas, and continued to reside here, during the time when Moses Ferguson held the possession, for a sufficient length of time to give Moses a complete title under the statute of limitations, which vested in respondent by virtue of his purchase at sheriff’s sale, of the interest and estate of Moses therein: admits the sale and his purchase under the execution, and relies upon it, and pleads that he is an innocent purchaser, for a valuable consideration: avers that there is no equity on the face of this amended bill, and that no such title has been alleged by the complainants, as to entitle them to partition. The answer is verified by affidavit. Hamilton Reynolds also answered for himself, and, by a separate answer, as guardian for the minor heirs of Sampson Gray, deceased, and admits upon information aiid belief that the land was sold for taxes and purchased by Gray, deceased, and sold by him as alleged in the bill: admits the death of Gray, the delivery of the certificate of purchase, afterwards, by his heirs at law and legal representatives, to Joseph ; that Joseph Ferguson placed Moses in the possession as alleged : that the interest of Moseswas sold under execution and purchased by Blakeney: that he intei’married with the widow of Gray, and is guardian for the minor heirs, and claims no interest either in right of his wife, or as guardian, or otherwise. In his answer as guardian, he makes a formal denial of the allegations of the bill and requires proof. The death of Henry C. Gray after the commencement of the suit was suggested, and a decree pro confesso taken against the other defendants in default. Replications having been filed, is-sue was regularly formed, the cause set down for final hearing,- and an order for deposition regularly made. Afterwards, on-motion, upon no other showing than the face of the bill and answer in, the name of Moses Ferguson was stricken out as a plaintiff and he was made a co-defendant, and his deposition ordered to-be taken; to which Blakeney excepted. Moses answered and admitted all the material allegations of the amended bill. Various exceptions were taken to the depositions, which it is unnecessary to notice, for any other purpose than to remark that numerous-affidavits were brought in pro and con, and several of them wereruled out and retaken. At this stage of the proceedings, on the 12th of February, -,, the mandate of this court, upon the reversal of the decree of the Circuit Court, which perpetuated the injunction of Blakeney from proceeding with his writ of possession, was filed, and a motion-made to dissolve the injunction in accordance therewith; and for an order of possession. Three days afterwards, to wit: on the 15th of February, , the complainant filed an amended petition for an injunction, which varied nothing material from the, original one, otherwise than by incorporating the amended bill in lieu of the original bill and prayed that the injunction might be continued until the final hearingof the bill and then perpetuated. On the 9th of Aug., , the motion to-dissolve the injunction and the petition to continue it, came on to be heard — -they seeming to have slumbered in the meantime. The former was overruled and the latter granted» and the two causes consolidated and ordered to progress to final heai'ing together as one cause, all against the objection of Blakeney, to which he filed his bill of exceptions. Ultimately, on the 21st January, , after the exceptions of Blakeney to the depositions of William Saunders, James Erwin and Moses Ferguson, taken on the 12th and 13th of December, ^, on the part of the complainant, had been overruled, the cause came on for final hearing upon the amended bill and exhibits, the amended petition and all the answers and replications, the depositions above mentioned and those of Samuel M. Rutherford and William E. Woodruff, taken on the 13th and 11th of January, , (to which exceptions had been before overruled and saved) and the exhib- . its referred to in said deposition. Whereupon it was decreed that the land in controversy should be sold for cash by a commissioner of the court, that out of the proceeds he should pay all the costs accrued in the Circuit Court in these causes, and out of the balance pay the appellant Blakeney one-sixth part, and pay' the residue into that court, subject to its future order. But that in the event the proceeds of the sale should be insufficient to pay all these costs, that Blakeney should pay one-sixth part of the deficit and the complainants the residue; and that the injunction against- Blakeney from proceeding with his order of possession should be perpetuated. To all of which Blakeney excepted and has appealed to this court. Thus at the end of about eight years from their inception, these voluminous proceedings were brought to an end in the Circuit Court, after having been in the meantime before this court for correction three several times; and it may be remarked as to the result, that this is not only materially variant from the ostensible object of the complainants, in procuring by decree title to the land in law and equity, and dower estate for the widow, but is oppressive upon the defendant, in putting heavy costs upon him, accumulated by the errors and imperfections of the plaintiff’s anomalous proceedings; while at the same time, the defendant, during most of this long period of time, has been kept out of his finally adjudged right to his writ of possession, and its fruits, by the totally unauthorized use of the writ of injunction, as appears, throughout the proceedings, by the complainants’ own showing. There was no allegation or pretence that the complainants ever feared any waste, or'any injury at all to the and in controversy, much loss that the defendant had threatened any such irreparable mischief, as it is the object of an injunction to prevent; while at the same time they expressly showed that the defendant claimed by adverse title, and as between him and them, the title was at least disputed, if not doubtful. ( Ves. R. , id. . Although the appellant may not avail himself of any objection to the decree relating to title or dower, because he may not be injured thereby, or for its failure to compensate him for the legitimate fruits of his writ of possession, of which he has so long been deprived by this clear abuse of the writ of injunction, because he has not so shaped his defence as to make this objection available to him in this way, he may nevertheless, at least claim in this court to be released from the onerous weight of the excessive costs, which the complainants’ anomalous and imperfect process has accumulated in the case, beyond the legitimate costs ot such a proceeding, (Dig. ch. , see. , p. . Passing by the various objections to the depositions, upon which this cause was tried, and which are saved by the appellants’ bill of exceptions, as well as some other points of minor importance that have been suggested we shall proceed at once to a conclusive objection to the decree, which is decisive of this cause. The complainants come into court upon a derivative title, setting up that they are the widow and heirs at law of Joseph Ferguson, deceased, and make their claim as such under him. This was a material part of their case. It was indeed of the very gist of their bill. The defendant answered, denying seriatim almost every other allegation. Prefacing his answer with the usual reservation, and concluding it, after a denial in terms of any “such title in the complainants or any of them as entitle them to partition,” with the usual formula “without this,” &c. To this the complainants, without any exception for insufficiency or other cause, interposed their replication in short upon the record by consent: the language of which, in the precedents, is that “these repliants say, that they will aver and prove their said bill to bo true, certain,” &c., and “that the said answer is uncertain, mi true, &c. All which matters and things these repliants are, and will be, ready to aver and prove,” &c. At the hearing, no proof was offered to establish that the complainants were the widow and heirs of Joseph Ferguson, deceased, other than the answer of Moses Ferguson; and the first question is, whether therefore, these material facts were admitted by the answer of Blakeney, the appellant. According to the theory of a proceeding in equity, the bill although sworn to, is never, at the hearing, evidence for the complainant in any other sense than as an admission of the defendant, either express or implied. It does not recognize the right of the complainant to become a witness in his own behalf, but to compel the defendant to become a witness in the cause, to the extent of a response to every allegation in the bill, and, in general, to confess or deny every one of those, the admission oí the truth of which may entitle the complainant to his legitimate relief. The effect of a total failure to answer, is an admission that the whole bill is true, if the defendant continues in this contempt, of the consequences of which he was warned originally before this effect was absolute; of which there are equivalent provisions in our statute. But it does not follow from this, that a partial failure to answer admits the fact unanswered to be true, without any warning at all. On the contrary, if upon exceptions sustained to such an answer, the defendant fails to answer further, instead of the part unanswered being taken as true at all as such, the whole bill is taken pro confesso generally; precisely as if no answer at all had been offered, (Jopling vs. Stewart, Ves. ; Turner vs. Gray, ib. in note, and other cases there cited;) and thus the defendant is allowed time and opportunity for repentance as before. In harmony with this is the formula of reservation, at the commencement of the answer, which it is said in Mad. Ch. , was probably intended to prevent a conclusion that the de^ fendant having submitted to answer the bill, admitted everything which by his answer he did not, in express terms, controvert. And also the rule of allowing the plaintiff to except to an answer for insufficiency, not only when the defendant fails to discover, but when he fails to admit or deny, or evades any material allegation. If the effect of a partial answer be, to admit the truth of the part unanswered, why except at all? Such an effect would be equivalent to an answer expressly admitting the part unanswered, and therefore make exceptions unnecessary. These exceptions serve to give notice to the defendant of matters which may, without design, have escaped his attention, or have not sufficiently arrested it, and enable him to do what he would have otherwise done, and thus save him from surprise. And certainly, in such cases he is more entitled to warning than when in contempt for failing to answer at all,-or to make further answer upon exceptions sustained for insufficiency. Inasmuch then, as when there is a total failure to answer, the complainant can by pro confesso get an implied admission of his whole bill; and equally so, when, upon exception sustained, there is a failure to answer further; and as he can require this as well as in aid of his proofs, or to avoid expense, as in cases where he cannot prove the facts at all otherwise than by a discovery; and as the opposite could not be otherwise than mischievous, in often resulting in surprise to the defendant, it seems far more reasonable that after replication without exception to an answer, which may fall short of a perfect one, the complainant should be held to have dispensed with the benefits of a better one, and thereby to have relied upon his own proofs; than that the defendant should be held to have admitted the truth without warning of what might have, without design, escaped his notice. And to this effect is the decided weight of authority, qualified however in some of the cases by an exception, where the omitted or evaded fact may be prima facie within the knowledge of the defendant, (Cochran vs. Couper adm’r, Harrington R. . Tate vs. Conner, Dev. Ch R. . Lum vs. Johnson, Iredell Ch. R. . Young vs. Grundy, Cranch. . Coleman vs. Lyne’s Ex’r, Rand. R. . Cropper vs. Barton, Leigh R. . Stewart vs. Strong, Gill & John. . Joice vs. Tayloe, Gill & John. .) But any exception would seem to be a departure from the principle and policy of equity practice, and of mischievous tendency. In Kentucky, where the exception prevails, it was held in the case of Owings vs. Patterson et al., A. K, Marsh. R. , in which the complainants claimed title to land as the heirs at law of Patterson, and from the generality and vagueness of the answer, the court was unable to determine whether or not the defendants intended to put the heirship in issue, that the proof of that material ingredient in the complainant’s case was upon them at the hearing, and for want of it in the record, reversed the decree in their favor for that cause alone. In the light of these views and of the authorities that we have examined and cited above, we have no doubt but that it was incumbent upon the complainants below in this case, to prove at the hearing that they were the widow and heirs at law of Joseph Ferguson, deceased, under whom they set up their claim for relief, and so hold. The question is then presented, whether or not the answer of Moses Ferguson, in which these facts are expressly admitted, was evidence to this point against his co-defendant Blakeney, the appellant. And waiving any question as to whether he was properly any party at all, we shall proceed at once to this inquiry. We have already seen that the operatioir of an answer, as evidence for the complainant is by way of admission. So, Judge Story said, in Reimsdyke vs. Kane, ( Gall. R. ,) when speaking of the admissions of one co-partner, which bind another, “an answer is no more than an admission, though a very solemn one.” “But an admission in an answer is something more than evidence: it is a concession in pleading, which requires no corroborating, and allows of no countervailing proofs,” as was remarked by Judge Baldwin, in the ease of Pettit vs. Jennings, Robt. Va. R. . And hence upon the reasonable foundation that no one can admit in evidence, or concede in pleading for another, except in these cases where he is so combined with that other, either legally or by fraud, that the act of one is the act of the other, rest the unquestionable general rule and its exceptions: that the separate answer of one or more defendants cannot be read in evidence to sustain the complainants’ bill against a co-defendant. If it were otherwise, a complainant might so frame his bill, as-to elicit evidence from one defendant to charge another, and to-exclude such matters as might discharge him. And the evidence thus obtained would be obnoxious to the objections against leading questions, and of being used against a party deprived of the-important privilege of cross-examination, whereby the complainant would have undue advantages against the most-- manifest principles of impartial justice. Indeed it would place an assignee or vendee completely in the power of his assignor or vendor, and subj ect him to the danger of being made the helpless victim of a fraudulent collusion. Nor does any failure of justice result from rejecting the answer of one defendant as evidence against a co-defendant, because the complainant does not deprive himself of the testimony of one defendant against another by his act,, of associating them together as defendants, as in a court of law. If he be not incompetent, or privileged by reason of his interest, the complainant may still examine him as a witness. If he be so, however, his answer can avail the complainant nothing, unless he has admitted it in the allegation sought to be proved. And when he has done so, he is no longer privileged, because he has already given evidence against himself. In the case last cited, upon the question, whether the answer of the assignor of a bond admitting the gaming consideration alleged in the bill, could be read in evidence against his co-defendant and his assignee, who had denied all knowledge of it, the doctrine we are examining was gone into at large, both upon principle and authority; and it was expressly found by the Virginia court, that the same principles which govern admissions in pais, whether verbal or written, or made in a former suit, to which the party against whom they were offered was not a party, whether by pleading or evidence or otherwise, govern also, in like manner, an admission in the answer of one defendant in a pending suit, when offered as evidence against his co-defendant. To the samo effect was the conclusion of the Illinois court, in Ihe case of Martin vs. Dryden et al., ( Gillman R ,) in a case where the vendor and vendee of land were defendants, when they said, “A better test to determine when such an answer would be evidence against a co-defendant claiming under him, or in the same right, as in the case of partners, or successors, is an answer to the question, would his admissions be evidence? Wherever the latter would be admissible, a fortiori, would his answer.” To the same effect is the language of Judge Story, in Reimsdyke vs. Kane et al., Gall. R. . It is accordingly laid down in Mr. Adam’s excellent work on the doctrines of Equity, page , that “The discovery obtained by a bill in equity is only available against the answering defendant. It cannot be read in evidence against a co-defendant, unless he refers to it by his answer as correct, or is so connected with the answering party as to be bound; under the, ordinary rules of law, by his declarations and admissions.” For this he cites Mitf. ; Anon. P. Wm. ; Chewes vs. Jones, Mad. ; Crope vs. Redinfield, Sim. ; and Green vs. Pledger Hare . To which the American Editors append numerous American cases, including the States of Maine, Vermont, New York, Mississippi, Virginia, Alabama and Maryland; to which they say numerous other cases may be added. It has been supposed, however, that the “rule does not apply to cases where the defendant claims through him whose answer is offered in evidence,” as is laid down in Greenleaf’s work on Evidence, p. , sec. : or, as it is elsewhere expressed, “Where one defendant succeeds to another, so that the right of the one devolves on the other, and they become privies in estate,” per Chief Justice Marshall, in Osborn vs. The Bk. of the U. States, Wheat. R. . This last mentioned case and that of Field vs. Holland, Cranch. R. , are the only two cases, besides those that have followed them as authority,)’ that give any sanction by this sup posed exception. These two cases were cited by the court of appeals of Maryland in the year , as an authority upon a point like that we are now considering, and that court disposed of them with the following language: “We have given to them a thorough examination and respectful consideration, but not being convinced of their correctness by the reason assigned in their support, and being unable to reconcile them to an otherwise unbroken series of authorities, both English and American, we do not hold ourselves bound to conform to them. (Jones vs. Hardesly et al, Gill & John. R. at p. .) The decision of the Maryland court upon this point, was approved, as a “well considered” one, by Chancellor Walworth, in the case of Cristie vs. Bishop, ( Barbour's Ch. R. at p. ,) * where the assignor and assignee of a judgment were the parties defendant to a bill alleging usury in the original transaction and the subsequent premiums for insurance; and the question was whether the answer of the former, admitting the truth of the allegation, could be read in evidence against the latter, who denied all knowledge as to all or any of the matters in the bill, except some unimportant particulars ; and he thus proceeds to remark upon these two decisions of the Supreme Court at Washington, which was cited to him as authority, “There are indeed two cases in which the late Chief Justice Marshall is supposed to have expressed an opinion, that the rule, that the answer of one defendant could not be read in evidence against another, except when they hold a join interest, does not apply to the case of a defendant who has derived title to the subject matter of litigation, under or through the one whose answer is offered in evidence against such defendant. (Field vs. Holland, Cranch. ; Osborn vs. U. S. Bank, Wheat. .) And see that the first of these cases is referred to by Professor Greenleaf, in his recent very valuable treatise on the law of Evidence, (Greenl. Ev. p. , sec. ,) as sustaining the same principle. “la the case of Field vs. Holland, this precise question was not before the court; and the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall only goes to the point, that the answer of a defendant, through whom the co-defendant claims, is evidence in favor of sdeh co-defendant, as to matters which both were called on to answer, in relation to transactions which took place before the sale to such co-defendant. -It may perhaps be inferred from the language of the Chief Justice in that ease, that if the answer of Holland had admitted the facts charged in the complainant’s bill, instead of denying them, it could have been used as evidence against his co-defendant, who had purchased under the judgment in his favor .againt Cox. But there certainly was nothing to authorize the reporter, in the syllabus of the decision in that case, to state, as ,a point decided by the court, that the answer of one-defendant is evidence against other defendants claiming through him. In the case of Osborne vs. The U. S. Bank, the question arose as to how far the answer of one treasurer of the State of Ohio, was .evidence against his successor in office, as to the identity of funds taken from the Bank by a former treasurer; both being joined as defendants in the same bill. And in reference to the principle of evidence, that the answer of one defendant cannot be read in evidence against another, Ch. J. Marshall says, “This is generally, but not universally true. Where one defendant succeeds to another, so that the right of the one devolves on the other, and they become privies in estate, the rule is not admitted to apply. Thus, if an ancestor die pending a suit, and the proceedings be revived against his heir', or if a suit be revived against an executor or administrator, the answer of the deceased person, or any other evidence establishing any other fact against him, might be read also against the person who succeeds to him.” And it certainly seems to have been the opinion of the court in that case, that these principles, the correctness of which no one can dispute, were applicable to the case, of an answer put in by a defendant, who had parted with all interest in the subject matter of litigation, previous to the commencement of a suit, to one who was afterwards made a co-defendant with him in such suit. But there is a manifest difference between that case and the case supposed in the opinion of the learned Chief Justice. For in the case supposed, the ancestor or of the deceased party, is an admission made by him while he was owner of the subject matter of litigation and was such as may be given in evidence against any person claiming title under him subsequent to such admission. And upon the same principle, if a bill is taken as confessed against a defendant before his death, and the suit is subsequently revived against his heir, or personal representative, they must apply to vacate the order taking the bill as confessed, if they wish to controvert the allegations in the bill, or set up any defence except such as has arisen subsequent to that order. For the sufficiency of the bill to be taken as confessed against him, was an admission by the original defendant, while he was alone interested in the subject matter of the litigation, that the allegations in the complainant’s bill were true, and that he had no valid defence to the claim made by the complainant, except such as appeared from the bill itself. The question, however, now under consideration, did not necessarily arise in the case of Osborn vs. The U. S. Bank, because the answer of Sullivan, the successor of Currie, contained a distinct admission that he received the money in controversy from Currie, his predecessor in office, who informed him at the time he delivered the money that it was the money which had been taken from the bank — that answer was therefore of itself on idence of the identity of the funds — for it contained evidence of the declaration of the former treasurer, made at the time he parted with the money to his successor. It was not therefore evidence of a declaration of the treasurer, after he had parted with all his interest in the fund to the defendant Sullivan. And as I understand the case, the decision of the court is placed upon that ground: though it is evident the opinion of the learned Chief Justice, was that the answer of Currie, under the circumstances of the case, was admissible in evidence as against a co-defendant.” The case was, that before the money in controversy had been taken from the Bank, a subpoena in chancery, and an injunction had been served upon Osborne, the Auditor, whose duty it was to execute tbe act of the Ohio Legislature, under the specific provisions of which, the money was afterwards taken by his agent, the collector of the revenue, with a full knowledge that the order for the injunction had been made. By this agent the money was delivered to Currie, the Treasurer, who, after keeping it a few days, transferred its possession to Sullivan, his successor in office. The bill was afterwards amended, alleging the facts that had transpired subsequently to the order for the injunction, and Currie and Sullivan made co-defendants with Osborne. When in connection with this State of the case, the whole of the remarks of Chief Justice Marshall, are considered, (as well as those quoted by the learned Chancellor, as those which immediately follow them,) it will not appear improbable but that the Chief Justice designed them all to apply only to defendants, who succeeded to rights or purchased the subject matter of litigation pendente lite; and that he regarded the case before him as, substantially, one of that character. If so, although the learned chancellor is doubtless to be sustained in his understanding of the true ground upon which the court decided the cause — that of the answer of Sullivan alone, whereby all that is said of the admissibility of Currie’s answer, is left as the dictum only of the Chief Justice — his impressions as to the extent of the view's of 'the latter would be too latitudinous. While-the more limited scope suggested for them, if sustainable would relieve those views from the otherwise just imputation of heterodoxy cast upon them by the learned chancellor. In the case of Pettit vs. Jennings, already cited, the court of appeals of Virginia, after coincident views with those of Chancellor Walworth, as to the departure of the case of Field vs. Holland, from settled principles and unbroken authority, when taken to have gone the extent of ruling that the answer of Holland would be evidence against his co-defendants claiming through and under him, had it admitted instead of denying the allegations of the bill, as has been inferred, and is stated in the syllabus of the reporter, which they pronounce “wrong” as to this: proceeds to give a version of the case, which relieves it from all criticism, as follows': “The principle of this decision is not that the answer of a defendant is evidence for the plaintiff' against a co-defendant, but that, when responsive to the bill it is evidence against the plaintiff for the responding defendant, and enures to the benefit of his co-defendant, claiming under him, when it destroys the foundation of the plaintiff’s claim. The language of the court is as follows: ‘Neither is it to be admitted that the answer of Holland is not testimony against the plaintiffs. He is the party against whom the fact, that the judgments were discharged, is to be established, and against whom it is to operate. This fact, when established, it is true, affects the purchasers also; but it affects them consequentially and through him. It affects them as representing him. Consequently, when the fact is established against or for him, it binds them. The plaintiffs themselves call upon Holland for a discovery. They aver that the judgments were discharged and expressly require him to answer this allegation. They cannot now be allowed to say that this answer is no testimony.’ It will be seen that the reasoning of the court is at first somewhat indefinite; we presume for the purpose of avoiding the very inference which has been erroneously drawn from it. Its object was to show, in the first place, that the fact of the payment or non-payment of the judgment, when properly established, would not only be evidence for or against the plaintiff therein, but would operate for or against the purchasers, (who were the co-defendants) under the authority thereof; at the same time avoiding the designation of the mode by which that fact, whether affirmative or negative, ivas to be established; and then to show that in the case before the court it was established negatively by the responsive answer of the defendant, Holland. There could be no propriety .in intimating any opinion as to what would be the effect of a directly opposite state of facts, to wit: an admission by the defendant Holland in his answer of the allegations in the bill, and in fact no such opinion was intimated.” Pettit vs. Jennings, Robt. Va. R. at p. . These two cases of Field vs. Holland, and Osborn vs. The Bank of the U. States being then disposed of, there are no other cases in the United States, except a few that have been decided expressly upon their supposed authority, which give any color, as we have already remarked, to the supposed exception to the general rule, which we have been examining. And Chancellor Walworth, after bis criticisms upon these two cases, and an elaborate examination of the various decisions to the contrary, remarks, “I have not been able to find any case in the reports of the court of chancery in England or in Ireland, in which the answer of one defendant has been permitted to be read in evidence against another, except in those cases where the defendants were combined, either legally or fraudulently, so as to create a unity of interest between them.” (Christie vs. Bishop, Barb. Ch. Rep. at p. . There are other cases, however, besides that of Field vs. Holland, where the answer of one defendant, in its operation against the complainant is allowed to operate also for the protection and shelter of a co-defendant. So, there are cases where the answer of the responding defendant, although in favor of the complainant, operates also for the like shelter of a co-defendant But neither class of cases in any degree violates the rule, that the answer of one defendant cannot be read in evidence against his co-defendant, or makes any exception to it, otherwise than in the merest matter of form, without any substance at alj — all being in conformity to the ordinary rules of law as to confessions, declarations and admissions. Of the former class is the American case of Mills vs. Gore, ( Pick. R. ,) where the protected defendant occupied the attitude of stakeholder, having been the mutual depository of the subject matter, and upon the bill of one of the contestants was made a co-defendant with the other, and defended himself under his claim. Thus circumstanced, he was allowed to read the answer in his favor upon the two grounds, as the court put it, that the complainants having called upon the responding defendant for the discovery, he could not be allowed to say that his answer was no evidence in the cause ; and that such testimony, when in favor of a co-defendant, was not within the reason of the rule, excluding the answer of one defendant against another, because in the former case, the important privilege of cross-examination is not sacrificed as in the latter. Of the latter class, is the English case of Greene vs. Pledger, ( Hare’s Rep. ,) where the case made by the bill, was that Bernard Angle, a bankrupt, for the purpose of swindling his creditors, secretly put money in the hands of his brother, John Angle, on the security of two promissory notes executed by Pledger, who knew that the money was the assets of the bankrupt: that when John Angle was summoned to attend, as a witness, on the fiat against his brother, Bernard, he refused to attend and absconded to Boulogne. The two promissory notes payable to John Angle, were taken from his possession by the messenger under the fiat, and delivered to the complainant, who was the official and creditors’ assignee of the bankrupt: and the notes not being endorsed, the complainant could not recover upon them at law against Pledger. Pledger answered admitting his liability to John Angle, but ignored altogether the case of the complainant, not admitting that the money, as alleged, was a part of the assets of the bankrupt, and submitted that if the court should be of opinion that the complainants were entitled to the notes, or the beneficial interest in them, that then he ought to be considered a stakeholder and be allowed his costs. Under an English statute, John Angle was served at Boulogne with a subpoena to appear and answer the bill. Afterwards the vice chancellor made an order that the service of a notice of motion upon John Angle at Boulogne, should be good service. The notice was accordingly served, and the motion then made, (founded upon affidavits as against John Angle) that Pledger should pay the money into court. John Angie did not appear, and the motion came on to be heard on the affidavits as against him, and upon the answer of Pledger to the bill already in. The Vice Chancellor in granting this motion, said: “The defendant Pledger admits his liability to John Angle, and ignores only the question of right as between the plaintiff and John Angle. If John Angle were not a party to this suit, the plaintiffs would have to join issue with Pledger upon their right as against John Angle, and would be bound to prove that right as against Pledger. But the latter being a party, it is with him, and him only, that the plaintiffs have to litigate that right: and a decree in the plaintiffs’ favor against John Angle will be a sufficient protection to Pledger. That it is with John Angle, the plaintiffs have to litigate that question is clear from the consideration, that an admission by John Angle in his answer, of the plaintiff’s right as against himself, would entitle the plaintiff to a decree according to the prayer of the bill. At the same time it is clear that John Angles’ answer would not, technically speaking, be evidence against Pledger. So, if the bill were taken pro confesso against John Angle, or if the plaintiffs’ rights, as against John Angle, were proved by evidence not receivable against Pledger. The consequence of both John Angle and Pledger being parties to the suit is, that a decree in the plaintiffs’ favor will decide the case between the co-defendants. (Chamley vs. Lord Dunsancy, Sch. & Lef. . Farquharson vs. Seton, Russ, per Lord Eldon,) I might refer to analogous cases, in which a disclaimer by one defendant has enabled the plaintiff to sustain his suit against another defendant; the principle being, that after a decree founded upon the disclaimer, the court will not permit the disclaiming party to open the question anew, (Leathes vs. Newitt, Ea. & Go. . Mounsey vs. Burnham, Hare .”) After showing him that the case before him was unlike the case of Doubless vs. Flint, ( Myln. & Cr. ,) the Vice Chancellor then concludes with the remark: “I want no evidence but what his answer gives me, and I take nothing from him but what he admits he has no right to hold as against John Angle. Against John Angle the case is established, for the present purpose at least, by the affidavits, to the l'eception of which he could not object.” The affidavits, by which this motion was supported, being taken, upon the hearing of the motion, as equivalent to the answer of John Angle, confessing the complainants’ equity upon the final hearing, it will be seen that this latter case differs from the Massachusetts case, just cited, mainly in the fact, that the answer of the real litigant defendant, was offered to be read by the complainant in the bill, instead of by the co-defendant, as in the Massachusetts case; and that, in the one case, the answer read denied the equity of the bill, while in the English case it is taken as confessing it. But the same principle governs both cases. That it is to say, in neither was the answer read in evidence against the co-defendant. In the Massachusetts case it was not against him, because he set up no right of his own, and the answer was against the complainant and in favor of the responding defendant, in whose right he made his defence. So, in the English case, it was not against the co-defendant, Pledger, as the Yice Chancellor labors to show by several illustrations, among others the case of a disclaiming defendant, while he dis-. tinctly recognizes the rule, that the answer of one defendant cannot be read in evidence against another; and concludes by repeating the idea, which he had been enforcing throughout: “I want no evidence against Pledger, but what his answer gives me, and I take nothing from him but what he admits he has no right to hold as against John Angle.” In both cases, however, the decree for and against the complainants, respectively, operated for the protection of the defendants, respectively, whose interest was balanced between the real litigating parties as would be the complainant’s attitude in a bill of interpleader. We have have used this case of Green vs. Pledger by way of illustration, and have set it out. at large, not only because it is apposite, but also because Mr. Dahiel, in his work on Chancery Pleading and Practice, (Vol. ,p. ,) has, upon the single foundation of this case, built what he seems to consider an exception to the general rule, and has expressed his idea of it in terms so vague and general as to be calculated to mislead, as well by those means as by giving to the case more prominence and importance than it deserves. The passage in his work to which we allude is this: “In cases, however, where the rights of the plaintiff, as against one defendant, are only prevented from being-complete by some question between the plaintiff and a second defendant, it seems that the plaintiff is permitted to read the answer of such second defendant for the purpose of completing his claim against the first;” and it was cited by this court as one of the authorities for admitting an exception to the general rule in the case of Whiting & Slark vs. Beebe et al. ( Eng. R. :) the other authorities cited being Field vs. Holland, Osborne vs. The Bank of the U. States, and Morse vs. Royal, Ves. R. ; which latter was a case where Green, a part of whose answer was received as evidence, was a defendant in the double capacity of executor of one deceased party, and as residuary legatee of another, between the estates of which deceased parties there was a complication of interest; and Lord Erskine allowed so much of his answer to be read, relating to his capacity of executor as was not in favor of his interest as a residuary legatee. And the same authorities had been before cited in the case of Barraque & wife vs. Siter, Price & Co., Eng. R. , where it was said that the rule of exclusion did not apply to cases where the defendant claims through him, whose answer is offered in evidence. But holding, as we must now do, after a more careful and thorough examination of the question, in which we have closely scrutinized these authorities, that the answer of one defendant cannot be read in evidence against his co-defendant, unless he refers to such answer as correct, or is so connected with the answering party as to be bound, under the ordinary rules of law, by his confessions, declarations or admissions, it is proper for us to remark that the doctrine of those cases upon this point must be so modified as to conform to the views now expressed. In reference to that exception to the general rule of evidence, that the admissions of one person cannot be given in evidence against another, which is founded upon and arises out of the connection of interest between the person making the admission and him against whom it is offered — -as that of joint ownership or liability, or that of the derivation of title of one several owner from another — there is this essential difference between a joint interest and a derivative interest, that is always of controling import upon a question of admissibility, that is to say, the joint interest to be affected by the admission must be a subsisting, one, at the time the admission was made; whereas in the other case, the derivative interest to be affected by the admission was made. must have been acquired after the admission was made. Whether the party making the admission and the party against whom it is offered, be connected by a joint ownership or liability, or by the transmission of a several title, from the former to the latter, the interest of the party making the admission must be a subsisting one at the time of the admission. If at the time of making it he has parted with his interest, his admissions are not legal evidence against him to whom it has passed. Upon this point the authorities are clear and numerous, and without exception or qualification in the application of the rule to vendors and assignors. Indeed the Supreme Court of New York, in the cases of Beach vs. Wise, Hill’s R. , and Starke vs. Boswell, Hill R. , have gone beyond this, and held that the admission of a former owner of personal property, or of a chose in action, even if made before he parted with his title, are not evidence against his vendee. This would, seem, however, to be an invasion upon established principles of evidence. Applying these principles to the answer of Moses Ferguson, it is entirely clear that it was not admissible as evidence against his co-defendant Blakeney. The result is, thatthe complainants have no evidence in the record to prove their material allegation, that they are the widow and heirs at law of Joseph Ferguson, .deceased, underwhom they claim to derive title to the land in controversy. Upon this ground then as well as that already considered as to costs, this decree must be reversed, and as the record does not furnish the materials upon which we can found another decree, which would reach all the merits of this case, we shall order the bill to be dismissed without prejudice to the rights of the complainants, and at their costs; that the appellant, Blakeney, may at once have the benefit of his writ of possession that has already been affirmed to Mm by this court.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862711,Allen vs. Allen,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker, delivered the opinion of the Court. Louisa H. Allen, by her next friend, filed her bill for a divorce and for alimony against her husband, Abraham Allen; to which he filed his answer denying the allegations therein, and set forth by way of cross bill, a complaint, in which he alleged a breach of the marriage contract, on the part of the complainant, which she was called upon to answer, and for a decree in his favor. For all substantial purposes the answer is a cross bill, and under our practice in chancery, must be so considered. It appears that at the instance of the complainant, the court had ordered the defendant to pay the next friend, for the temporary support of the complainant, a sum of money at stated periods, which order the defendant, for several grounds set forth in his motion, moved the court to set aside; one of the reasons for setting aside the order was, that the next friend was insolvent. The court refused to vacate the order, but ordered that the next friend give security for costs on or before the second day of the next term of the court, or that the suit should be dismissed. At the next term of the court, the next friend filed his written statement, in which he declined to comply with the order of court, and expressed a willingness that the suit should be dismissed. To this the defendant objected and offered to waive the necessity for giving security in obedience to the order of court. But the court disregarded his objection and dismissed both the original and the cross bill, to which the defendant excepted and appealed to this court. There can be no doubt under the state of case, but that the court erred in dismissing the suit. The defendant did not move the court to dismiss the suit; nor did he consent that it should be done; and under the circumstances ofthe case, even if the complainant had formally moved the court to do so, the statute expressly declares that, after a cross bill is filed, the complainant shall not, without the consent of the defendant, dismiss the suit. Dig. ch. , sec. . But in this case the suit was not dismissed at the instance of either party, but by order of court. We will not say that a state of case might not arise, where, by the acts of the parties in the prosecution of a suit, or in failing or refusing to comply with the orders of the court, that the court might not order the suit to be dismissed; but under the state of casé here presented, we are satisfied that the court erred in dismissing the suit against the objection of the defendant. The order and decision of the court dismissing the suit must be reversed and set aside, and the cause remanded with instructions to reinstate the case upon the docket, that the same may be heard upon its merits.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,neutral
1862733,Leach vs. Lambeth,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Justice Walker delivered the opinion of the Court. This is an action of debt brought by Lambeth against Leach and Simmons upon a writing obligatory, executed by them to the plaintiff. The defendant, Simmons pleaded infancy, and the other defendant, nil debet, payment and set-off' Upon the first two pleas issue was taken: to the third, the plaintiff demurred, upon the ground that there was not such mutual indebtedness between the plaintiff and the defendant, set forth in the plea, as to constitute a valid set-off under the statute; in this, that the contract sued upon was executed by Simmons and Leach, and that pleaded in set-off was in favor of Leach alone. The Circuit Court sustained the demurrer to the plea; and the correctness of its decision upon this point, is the sole question presented for our consideration. The statute, Set-off, sec. , Dig. page , provides: “ That when two or more persons are mutually indebted to each other, &c., and one of them commences an action against the other, one debt may be set-off against the other, although they may be of a different nature.” Being remedial this statute should be construed liberally, so as to accomplish the object intended by its enactment, which was, by setting off one debt against another, to prevent cross actions, delay and unnecessary expense. The plaintiff contends that the term “mutually indebted,” means only such debts, or demands as exist, and are due from all of the plaintiffs to all of the defendants: and in suppoi’t of this position, refers to one of the earlier decisions of this court, Trammell vs. Harrell, Ark. Rep. . In that case, it is worthy of remark, that the sufficiency of the plea of set-off was not presented upon demurrer, nor was exception taken to the evidence upon the trial of the issue formed upon it, nor does it appear whether the question was directly presented by assignment of errors, or argued by counsel. The court, however, proceeded to consider the question, and held that a debt or demand, to be a set-off, must be due from the sole plaintiff, or plaintiffs, to the sole defendant or defendants. The chief justice, dissenting, held that, although a demand, not due from all of the plaintiffs to the defendant or defendants, could not be pleaded as a set-off, yet as regarded’the indebtedness of the plaintiffs to one or more of the defendants, the rule was different; and that a debt or demand, due from the plaintiff or plaintiffs to any one, or all of the defendants, was a mutual subsisting indebtedness within the spirit and meaning of the statute, and might be pleaded as a set-off against the plaintiff’s demand. This construction of the statute, in our opinion, is best calculated to give effect to it, and accords with the other acts, which make all contracts joint and several, whether so or not in terms, by which the plaintiff may, at his election, sue one or all of the fendants. Á payment by one defendant is, in effect, a payment by all. The defendants may plead separately, and any defence to the merits of the action enures to the benefit of all: and if the plaintiff is indebted to one of several defendants, and such defendant should choose to pay and discharge the debt of himself and his co-defendant out of it, it is, in effect, the payment and satisfaction of both, and no good reason seems to exist why he should not be permitted to do so. Such defence in no wise affects the rights of the co-defendant, or of the plaintiff: not of the defendant, because so far from increasing his liability, it lessens it by discharging a debt, for the whole of which he was bound to the plaintiff; nor does it prejudice the rights of the plaintiff, because, if in truth he owes the defendants or either of them, he should not, in good conscience, be permitted to coerce payment from them, or one of them (which is in effect from both), without at the same time paying that which he owes them, and to compel this, and prevent litigation and unnecessary costs and delay, the statute of set-off was passed. The rule laid down in Trammell vs. Harrell, although subsequently adhered to in Gray vs. Badgett, Field vs. Watkins and Woodruff vs. The State, seems never to have been fully acquiesced in: and in Sillivant & Thorn vs. Reardon, Ark. , it was not only qualified and explained, but an express intimation was there given, that a more liberal construction of the statute should be adopted. The question is again presented for our consideration, and under circumstances which clearly show, that unless a more liberal construction is given to the statute than that in Trammell vs. Harrell, it will, in many instances, fail to accomplish the end for which it was enacted. In this case Simmons, one of the joint and several obligors, was a minor, pleaded his minority and was discharged. So that in fact, Leach, the other defendant, was the only legally bound defendant. It is true that the plaintiff sued him jointly with Simmons, but he was alone absolutely bound for the debt. Leach pleaded a subsisting debt due from the plaintiff to him, and there certainly can be no good reason why he should not be permitted to do so. It is clearly a case within the spirit and intent of the statute, which is merely remedial and as a modification of the rule, as laid down in Trammell vs. Harrell, will in no. wise affect the title to property, but will at the same time give effect to the statute in accordance with its obvious intent, we feel less reluctant to do so, and to adopt that held in the dissenting opinion of the chief justice, which we think sustained, as well by reason and a fair construction of the statute, as the decisions of other courts. Thus in Kentucky, Dunn vs. West, B. Mon. , one of several defendants was allowed to set-off his separate demand against the plaintiff, who sued upon a joint and several contract. And in Powell vs. Hoge, B. Mon. , in a suit upon a joint bond against two defendants, the decision in Dunn vs. West was approved. In commenting upon the statute and the effect of the plea, the court of appeals said, “The plaintiff cannot be enjoined by the discharge of his own liability. There is no other person jointly interested with him in the debt. And as it is a voluntary assumption of the payment of the whole debt by one defendant, the other defendants jointly bound with him have no cause of complaint.” This is the view taken of the'question in the dissenting opinion in Trammell vs. Harrell, in the correctness of which we fully concur. , Judgmentjre versed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862639,Central Bank of Georgia vs. Veasey,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. The action was debt, upon judgment rendered in another State. The allegation in the declaration, setting out the judgment, is that the plaintiff, on &c., at a superior court, held in the county of Talbot, in the State of Georgia, to wit, &c., by the considera] tion and judgment of said court, recovered against the defend' ant the sum of one hundred and twenty dollars, for her debt, as also the further sum of twenty-one dollars and thirty-three cents for her damages, which she had sustained by reason of the detention of said debt, together with the further sum of ten dollars and fifty cents for her costs in and about said suit in that behalf expended, whereof the defendant was convict prout patet per recordura, fyc,. The transcript produced to the court below, upon the issue to the plea of nul tiel record, shows that, in an action of assumpsit, before the superior court of Talbot county, Georgia, the defendant confessed judgment to the plaintiff for the sum of one hundred and twenty dollars, principal, with interest and costs of suit, and the plaintiff’s attorney signed judgment as follows: “Whereupon, it is considered by the court that the plaintiff do recover of the defendant the sum of one hundred and twenty dollars, for its principal debt, and the further sum of twenty-one dollars and thirty-three cents, for its interest, and the further sum of ten dollars and fifty cents, for costs of suit in this behalf expended,” &c. In the authentication of the judgment, the judge, who certifies to the attestation of the clerk, styles himself thus: “I, Alfred Iverson, Judge of the Superior Courts of the Chatahoochee circuit, in said State, in which circuit is said county of Talbot,” dec. The court below rejected the transcript offered in evidence, and gave judgment for the defendant. We think there is no substantial variance between the judgment described in the declaration and that disclosed in the transcript. The original recovery, though informal, is, in effect, the same as that described by the pleader in this suit. It is true the cases cited for the plaintiff, among which are, The State Bank vs. Gray, Eng. . State Bank vs. Magness, ib. , and The State Bank vs. Sherrill, ib. , cannot be said to apply, because in those cases, the recital of the record was only inducement to the main fact intended to be established by it, that is, the institution of a former suit upon the same cause of action, to rebut the presumption arising from lapse of time; and the case of Adams vs. The State for the use of Wallace, at July term, , was decided upon a like reason. But here the judgment sued upon is necessarily the foundation of the action, and it must be conceded that a misdescription of it, in any material matter, would be a fatal variance. Yet in such cases the pleader is not required to describe the recovery in haec verba, or according to its-tenor; but may set it out according to its legal effect. The rate of interest allowed by law, is the measure of damages for the breach of a contract to pay money, and whether the action be in form, assumpsit or debt, the damages, in the shape of interest, follow as a legal consequence upon the ascertainment of the debt. The judgment is correctly described, as to the parties, the' court by whom rendered, its dates and amounts, and the declaration would therefore seem to be a compliance with the reason-for the rule of pleading, that a contract must be accurately described in order to identify the cause of action, for the protection’ of the defendant and as a security against further litigation. The cause of the rejection, not necessarily appearing, it may be possible that the Circuit Court excluded the transcript offered-in evidence, upon the ground that it was not sufficiently authenticated; and so this court might have to hold, were it not for the decision in Butler vs. Owen, Eng. , that where a judge in his attestation, is described as judge of the court, it is a sufficient authentication under the act of Congress, without saying.that he-is the judge, or sole judge; and we are not inclined to depart from the precedent there established in any ease, where, as in the present instance, there is nothing on the face of the record adduced, from which it could be inferred that the court was composed of more than one judge or-magistrate.

1862644,In the matter of the Will of Cornelius,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court, It appears from the record in this case that on the 14th of February, , the clerk of the Hempstaad Probate Court, in vacation, granted letters of administration to Jester Cornelius upon the estate of William Cornelius, deceased, and that after-wards, the last will and testament of the deceased was found, and that it was admitted to probate, and allowed as such by the clerk in vacation, on the 12th of April. At the July term, , of the Probate Court, the clerk produced the will, together with the proofs taken before him in support of the same. Jester Cornelius, who was one of the executors named in the will, appeared and resisted the probate, filing various exceptions thereto. The exceptions being considered, were overruled by the court, which proceeded to adjudge that the probate of the will in question, as taken and made before the clerk in vacation, be approved and confirmed; that the letters of administration granted to the contestant be revoked, and letters testamentary issued, or in lieu thereof, letters of administration with the will annexed, in case the executors named should refuse to act. Jester Cornelius excepted to this decision and appealed to the Circuit Court, which being of opinion that there was no error appearing in the judgement of the Probate Court, affirmed the same; and from the decision of the Circuit Court he has appealed to this court. ""Waiving the enquiry suggested, whether any question was technically well reserved by the bill of exceptions taken by the appellant to the judgment of the Probate Court, and which the Circuit Court, under the statute, would have to determine, in order to ascertain whether the Probate Court had erred in relation to any material question of law or fact, before proceeding to try the matter denovo; and allowing to the appellant the full benefit of every objection he may have designed to make to the probate of the will, as it appears upon the record, another enquiry, and one of more general concern presents itself; and that is, whether the appellant had any right to be heard before the Probate Court, in opposition to the probate of the will, or any right to appeal from its decision, whereby that could be made available as a mode of testing the validity or invalidity of the supposed will. While that portion of the statute of wills, which prescribes the requisites of a valid will, and the formalities attending its execution, once understood and familiar to the minds of the people 'at large, ought to remain unchanged, unless for some urgent reason ■of public policy, there are some other provisions relating to the proof and establishment of wills, difficult to harmonize as a system, and which would seem to need a careful revision. The ■authors of the revised code of , in framing this title, evidently intended to adopt the leading features of the New York Statute of , while they have retained some of the provisions of the Territorial Statute of wills, with such omissions and changes as they thought proper to make. In the first place wills of realty and personalty are put on the ■same footing, and however proper this may be, and in accordance with the administration law, making lands assets and, under some circumstances, a primary fund in the hands of the administrator for the payment of debts, it might be difficult to determine, upon the whole statute, what effect is intended to be given to the probate of a will as evidence, prima facie or conclusive, as a muniment of title, or upon creditors, legatees, or fieirs, who may, upon various contingencies, be interested in the estate. It is made the duty of the clerk in vacation, as well as cf the.Probate Coui’t, when informed of the existence of a will, to issue process to compel its production in order that it may be probated. The clerk is required to take proof of any will, and grant a certificate of probate, or a certificate of rejection; a judicial function, falling so clearly within the principle adjudged in Kennedy ex parte, Eng. , holding that a master in chancery cannot issue a writ of injunction, and Scoggin vs. Taylor, Ark. , that no power could be conferred upon the same officer to issue a writ of ne exeat, that if these cases are adhered to, so much of the statute would be unconstitutional, were it not for the further provision, that the act of the clerk, in pursuance of the power conferred on him by the statute, is “subject to the rejection of the court;” by which we understand it to be the duty of the Probate Court, in all cases, to confirm or set aside the proceedings had before the clerk, whose authority is temporarily executed for the immediate preservation of the estate, and who acts ministerially in certifying the evidence, and preparing the subject matter for the adjudication of the court in term time. The constitution indicates the court of probate as the proper forum, where provision should be made by law, for the determination of all controversies respecting the validity of wills, with the right of appeal as in other cases. No good reason is perceived why this should not be so : and in this country, where all courts are statutory, there is no foundation for jealousy between common law and chancery or ecclesiastical jurisdiction, nor is-there any substantial reason, in the supposed superiority of the landed interest, for excluding the salutary jurisdiction of chancery, in cases proper for its interposition, by making the validity of wills affecting real estate triable only at law. Yet the statute, Digest, Title, Wills, sec , et seq., contemplates an issue, upon-petition in the Circuit Court, to be tried by a jury, and treated as a common law proceeding, as the proper, if not the only conclusive mode available to any person interested, for establishing or' rejecting any will, which had been previously rejected or established by the court of probate; while at the same time the proceedings before the Probate Court, as well as its clerk in vacation, appear to be summary and ex parte; nor did the original re-visors of the statutes make any provision for an appeal from the"" decision of the Probate Court, in establishing or rejecting a will.It is true, by sec. , Title, Administration, appeals are allowed1 from all orders revoking letters testamentary or of administration, but that obviously relates to cases where the executor or administrator may be removed for alleged misconduct and the like,- and could hardly be construed to include a case like the present,, where the accidental circumstance exists, that the appellant having been appointed administrator, as in cases of intestacy, was' necessarily superseded by the establishment of a will brought to-' the notice of the Probate Court. But by an- amendatory statute, passed January 4th, , it was enacted that, “appeals shall be granted from any final order,judgment or decree of the Probate Courts of this State, to the appropriate Circuit Courts, in the same manner as they are now' allowed in certain cases from the Probate Court.” Though very much in doubt, whether this act was intended to include decisions of the Probate Court in admitting or rejecting a will, in cases where those classes of persons, whom the law would presume to be adversely interested, had not been summoned or notified, and were not necessarily before the court, or bound by the adjudication, as a proceeding in rem, yet such an exception would not be warranted by the explicit and comprehensive language used: and the conclusion is inevitable, that the appellant had the right to appeal from the decision of the Probate Court, establishing the will, and consequently the right to be heard there in opposition to it. Though possibly as the law now stands, this result might follow: that an unbidden suitor in the Probate Court, would be concluded by the adjudication, to which he had chosen to make himself a party, should he afterwards attempt to assert the validity or invalidity of the same will by an independent proceeding before the Circuit Court. The appellant made the objection in the Probate Court, and is entitled to have it considered here, to so much of the testimony as appeared to be in response to leading interrogatories put by the clerk, who took the proof of the will. The two subscribing witnesses appeared before the clerk, who caused their testimony to be reduced to writing, signed by them, and which he certified in accordance with the statute. To one of those witnesses he propounded certain interrogatories, some of which are clearly leading. However improper such a mode of examination may be, even when conducted by a disinterested officer, in the discharge of his duty, and objectionable unless the leading questions are explanatory, or allowed, in the discretion of the court or officer, to be put to a reluctant witness, the objection made here is not available to the appellant, because the testimony of the other witness, given in the form of a statement, and to whom the interrogatories do not appear to have been addressed, is full and conclusive as to all the points relied on to establish the will, and corroborative also of the witness, who responded to interrogatories. It is also insisted for the appellant that the will is invalid, because it was not signed in the testator’s presence; and numerous authorities are cited in support of what would be a very plain proposition under the statute of 29th of Charles II. The facts are, in this case, that after the testator made his mark, the two attesting witnesses walked out into the gallery, or entry as one of them calls it; and signed their names as witnesses, and which, as they state, was done merely for convenience. It does not appear whether the testator could have seen them if he had desired to do so. However desirable it might always be, when practicable, to have the attestation of a will completed by the signatures of the witnesses in the presence of the testator, it is not necessary to its validity under the statute of , as held in Rogers vs. Diamond, Ark. . And as both of the witnesses appeared in person before the clerk, there is no place for the strained application of the inconsistent sections and , of the statute, which seem to require that where a subscribing witness is unable to attend, or lives abroad, his deposition, if taken under a commission, must state certain things, and among them that the deponent subscribed his name to the will as a witness, in the presence of the testator. The identity of the will prepared according to instructions given by the testator, the bona fide execution and attestation of it within the terms of the statute, are fully proved, unless it is to be held invalid, because of the remaining objection, which we now proceed to consider. At the end of the will, the- subscription and attestation are as follows: “Signed in Hempstead county Arkansas, date above written. his WM. j*j CORNELIUS, mark. Signed in the presence of us, and we witness the same in the presence of each other date first written. J. H. NELSON, E: W. MATHEWS.” The proof is, that the will was prepared by one William Elk-ins, who, when it came to be executed, wrote the name of the testator, William Cornelius, at the end of the will for him, at his request, and the testator signed the same by making his mark, as appears on the face of the will. The language of the statute sec-. , is that every will “must be subscribed by the testator at the end of the will, or by some person for him, at his request.” The succeeding section , is as follows: “Every person, who shall sign the testator’s name to any will, by his direction-, shall- write his own name as a witness to such will, and state that he signed -the testator’s name at his request.” The first clause quoted seems to have been retained from the Territorial Statute, Steele & McCamp. Dig. Title, Winns, sec. , which required the will to-be signed by the testator, or by some other person in his presence and by his direction; while section is taken.from the New York Statute, before referred to, which, without any express provision, that the testator’s name may be signed for him.-by another person, implies that in case of a will, as in other acts-, what is done by the direction of the testator is done by him, inasmuch as it provides, that “the witnesses to any will shall write opposite to their names, their respective places of residence; and every person, who shall sign the testator’s name to any will by his direction, shall write his own name as a witness to the will. Whoever shall neglect to comply with either of these provisions, shall forfeit fifty dollars,” &c. But such omission shall not affect the-validity of any will-; nor shall any person, liable to the penalty aforesaid, be excluded or incapacitated on that account, from testifying respecting the execution of such will.” The entire section quoted explains itself; but the partial, and, we had almost said, inconsiderate adoption of it in- our statute has a very different effect: and there is no room to doubt, that where another person signs the testator’s name by his direction, the will is invalid unless such person shall also write his own name as a witness: in other words, the requirement of the statute, that the witness in such case shall also write his own name, is not merely directory, to secure better evidence of the due execution of the will, but is a necessary ingredient of the attestation itself. Where this requirement is wanting, the paper not being holographic, might perhaps., under certain circumstances, he established as a nuncupative will, but for all other purposes, it would be an attempt at testamentary disposition, the same as a paper without any subscribing witness, though in fact executed and published, animo tcslandi, in the presence of witnesses. The enquiry, then, is whether this is a case within the meaning of the statute, where another person has signed the testator’s .name to the will by his direction; or whether the testator, by making his mark, did subscribe the will, so as to dispense with the attesting signature of the person by whom the testator’s name was written. And in view of the peculiar phraseology and context of the statute, requiring, as it does, but two witnesses, making acknowledgment by the testator equivalent to subscription, dispensing with the ceremony of simultaneous attestation by both witnesses at the time of subscription or acknowledgment or a subscription by either witness in the presence, actual or constructive, of the testator, it must be conceded that the intention, to be gathered from it, is doubtful. The argument, on the one hand, is that the power of testamentary departure from the usual and equitable course of descents and distributions, and which incites fraud by its unavoidable association with unpaired judgment and enfeebled will of the testator, ought to be strictly pursued. And we are warned, by the successive deviations, tolerated and afterwards regretted by eminent judges, from the statute of Chas. , and which could only have been allowed by construit4g the statute to mean, that it was not so much the will or paper itself that was to be attested, but the act of the testator in executing and publishing it as his will, to adhere to what seems to be the policy indicated in the changes made by our own statute. It is clear, from the statute, that where the testator does not bimself subscribe the will, the formal attestation of the person who signs his name for him is required. In this mode illiterate persons could execute a will; and the decision here must be in favor of the appellant if the statute thereby intended to exclude subscription by means of a mark, and to insure the identity of the will by preserving evidence of hand writing, either that of the testator, or of the person who signed for him. But we cannot tíonclude that such was the intention of the statute; and for the reasons following must hold this will to be sufficiently executed. It is to be presumed that our statute was enacted with a knowledge of the statute of of Car. , and the construction put upon it in England, and by the courts of this country upon similar statutes, as adopted in the several States. Under that statute, which authorized the will to be signed by the devisor, or by some other person in his presence, and by his direction, it has been uniformly held that a signature of the devisor by making his mark, is good. And it was not so held because that was the only mode in which ignorant persons, otherwise capable of devising, could sign. There might be an obvious propriety in allowing a devisor, exhausted by sickness, to sign by a mark. In Baker vs. Denning, Adol. & Ellis, , where the question was, for the first time, made in England, whether a de visor, who could write, might sign by his mark, from .choice, and without any apparent necessity for doing so, it was held to be a sufficient signing, though with some hesitation. Mr. Justice Patterson, however, said, “If it be once conceded that a mark by way of signature, is a signing within the act, it is too much to say that in every particular case, we are to enquire minutely into the ability of the party to write his name. It would be inconvenient to enter into such a question, and there is always the attestation: so that when a mark appears, there are means of enquiring into the circumstances; and the enquiry in such a case is, of course, more close than in ordinary cases. But I am not prepared to say, that a man may not, at any time, sign by merely putting his mark, whether he can write his name or not.” So, the attestation by the mark or initials of a subscribing witness was held good in Harrison vs. Harrison, Vesey J. . Addy vs Grix, id. . Notwithstanding what Lord Hardwick said in Grayson vs. Atkinson, Vesey sen. , that the statute requiring the will to be signed undoubtedly meant some evidence to arise from hand writing, there seems to be no adjudged case in England under the statute, that a will may not be made or attested by persons, who do not write their names, and he was there speaking of signing in opposition to sealing. It is true that Mr. Justice Washington, in the case of Stevens vs. Vancleve, Wash. Ct. Ct. , arising upon the New Jersey Statute, which required the will to be signed by the testator, omitting the words, “or some other person in his presence and by his express direction,” argues in favor of a mark being a good subscription by a testator; because the statute could not have intended to deny the privilege of making a will, to those who from accident, disease or want of education, could not write. And the argument may be good for that purpose, without leaving it to be inferred that the testator must write his name in all cases, where he may be able to do sol The recent English statute of , applying to real and personal estate, does not differ materially from that of of Car. , and the interpretations put upon it, except in these particulars; that it must be signed by the testator at the foot or end, and that such signature, or the testator’s acknowledgment of it shall be made before two or more witnesses present at the same time. Under this statute also it has not been doubted that a signature by initials or mark of the testator would be good. In the goods of Savory, Eng. Law. & Eq. . In re Field, Curteis, . In re Bryce, ib. . Admitting the marked difference between this feature of the New York Statute and our own, the one being directory and the other imperative, still the cases in New York are authority upon the point involved; that is, when the testator’s name is written and he makes his mark — is that a subscription by him, or a signature for him by another person? Our statute evidently uses the words, subscription and signing at the end as synonymous. In Chaffee vs. Baptist, Miss. Con. Paige , Chancellor Walworth did not hesitate to say that the testator might subscribe by making his mark, and it was not necessary that he should be able to write his name, though the statute also recognized the mode of the testator’s name being subscribed for him by his direction. In Butler vs. Benson, Barb. Sup. Ct. Rep. , the court, in giving a summary of their statute, say: “The testator must subscribe his name at the end of the will, which may be by his autograh, or by his mark, or if he is unable to write, by another in his presence and by his express directions.” Our statute, which undertakes to remedy some of the evils growing out of the decisions under the statute of Charles , by requiring subscription at the end of the will, and publication or some declaration by the testator, at the time of subscription or acknowledgment, of his knowledge of the testamentary character of the instrument, and an attestation by witnesses at his request, as an equivalent for the security afforded by their attestation in his presence, or according to the late English Statute, their simultaneous attestation, does not in other respects differ from it. It allows the testator to subscribe by another person for him at his request. There is no indication in it, that a testator, who from ignorance or physical inability is unable to write his name, or from choice, may not well subscribe by making his mark or his initials, which is vouched for by the attestation of the witnesses, sufficiently clear to change the rule of law as heretofore understood. And we think we are giving full effect to the 5th section above quoted, by holding that when the testator’s name is signed to a will by his direction, and he does nothing more, thereby adopting such signature as his subscription, in such case the person, so signing for the testator, must also write his own name as a witness, and state that he signed the testator’s name at his request, and that it ought not to apply to a case where the testator does himself sign though by making his mark. An examination of the cases cited for the appellant, from the Pennsylvania reports, satisfies us that they can have no decisive bearing upon this question. In that State the abuses and uncertainties of the construcción of their previous law’s concerning wills, induced a change by act of , requiring “that every will shall be in writing, and unless the person making the same shall be prevented by the extremity of his last sickness, shall be signed by him at the end thereof, or by some person in his presence and by his expiess direction; and in all cases, shall be proved by the oaths or affirmations of two or more competent witnesses, otherwise such will shall be of no effect.” The decisions in Dunlop vs. Dunlop, Watts, . Cavett's Appeal, Watts & Serg. , and Gabrill vs. Barr, Pa. State Rep. , to the effect that the testator must sign his name to the wii], unless proved by two witnesses that he was prevented from doing so by the extremity of his sickness, and that the mark of the testator will not suffice, the only substitute for his name, written by himself, being the writing of it by some person at his request, which must also.be proved by two witnesses, are in harmony with the statute. And in that State, where the witnesses are required by the statute to attest the execution of the will, but are not required to subscribe it, and never were, Stricker vs. Groves, Wharton, , it is not surprising that the courts should defend the policy of the statute, by insisting upon the security of the better evidence intended to be preserved by the autograph signature of the testator, in all cases where it would have been possible to procure it.

1862664,"Danley, Auditor, &c. vs. Whiteley","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court; It appears from the record before the court on this appeal from the judgment of the Pulaski Circuit Court in a proceeding by mandamus, that at the December term, , of that court, the relator, Whiteley, presented his petition setting forth, in substance, that pursuant to a joint resolution of the General Assembly, approved on the 12th day of November, , making it the duty of the Committee on Public Printing to receive proposals, and contract with the lowest bidder, for the printing of the then present General Assembly, and such other public printing as the pub ¡ lie service mightrequire previous to the meeting of the next General Assembly, and to take bond to the State, with sufficient security, for the faithful performance of the contract, the proposals made by the relator were accepted by the committee as the lowest bid, and he accordingly entered into the contract and gave the bond required; all of which, on the report of the committee, was approved by the General Assembly, on the 20th of November, . The relator further represented, that in compliance with his contract, after printing the Acts of that General Assem-' bly, the account for which had been paid and settled, he proceeded to print one thousand copies of the journal of the Senate, and one thousand copies of the journal of the House of Representatives, the number of each required by law to be printed and deposited in the office of the Secretary of State: that he printed the Senate Journal from the copy furnished him by the Secretary of the Senate, containing pages of printed matter, the price for which, according to contract was $ ; that along with the House Journal proper, he was also furnished by the clerk of the House of Representatives, with copies of certain documents, consisting of the report of the Financial Receiver of the Bank of the State of Arkansas, including various tabular statements made out by him, and forming a part of his report; also oí the report of the State Land Agent, and that of the Superintendent of the Penitentiary, and a petition of the Attorney General, presented to the Legislature. The relator avers that in consequence of these documents having formed a part of those accompanying the Governor’s Message, at the opening of the session, or of their having been referred to appropriate committees and forming the basis of legislative action, they became a part of the journal of the House, necessary and proper to be printed, and the clerk whose duty it was to do so, furnished him with copies of them, for the purpose of being printed with the journal, of which they constituted an integral part, and he accordingly printed them in the form of an Appendix: that the journal of the House, not including the appendix, contained printed pages, the contract price for which was $ , and the cost of printing the matters contained in the Appendix, estimated according to the established rules among printers, with reference to the terms specified in the contract, the size of the tables being reduced to correspond with the pages of the printed journal was $, , amounting together to the sum of $, . The relator further represented. that having deposited the requisite number of copies in the office of the Secretary of State, and presented an account of the items charged for the work, that officer accepted the journals as printed in due time and in a workmanlike manner, and on the 13th day of August, , delivered his official certificate to the relator annexed to the account in question, certifying that the relator’s account for printing the journals amounted, according to his contract, to $, in specie, and in script, estimating it at cents to the dollar, to $, due for such printing. This certificate exhibited with the petition proceeds as follows: “Mr. Whiteley having made an error in his account for printing the Acts, of $, , amounting in script at cents to the dollar, at which rate he was paid for printing the Acts, to the sum of $,, this latter amount must be deducted from his present account for printing the journals, leaving a balance due to him of $, , for which sum the Auditor will draw a warrant on the Treasurer in favor of Mr. Whiteley.” The relator, after, averring the presentation of the account with the certificate of the Secretary of State annexed, to the Auditor of Public Accounts, and his refusal, upon request, to issue his warrant for the amount so certified to be due, and that there remained in the Treasury an unexpended balance of money appropriated on the 11th of January, , to pay for printing the Acts and Journals, more than sufficient to pay the same, prayed for an alternative writ of mandamus to the Auditor, that he issue his warrant, or show cause why he does not do so. The Auditor in his response to the alternative writ awarded by the court, showed for cause why he did not obey it, that to issue the warrant in favor of Whiteley for the sum demanded, being the balance of $, , as certified to be due him by the Secretary of State, would be a gross wrong to the State, and a fraud upon the public treasury, in his judgment; and he proceeded to state the facts and reasons, upon which his refusal was predicated, to the following effect: That on the 20th of May, , Whiteley had presented to the respondent, as Auditor, an account for printing the Acts of the General Assembly of -, and the reports-and tables appended thereto, certified to be correct by D. B. Greer, Secretary of State, in which he charged for such printing, $, in specie, and the Secretary of State, in his certificate to the Auditor, estimating the value of State script at cents on the dollar, directed respondent to issue his warrant on the Treasurer in favor of Whiteley, for $, in payment of the same: That this account being regularly certified by the Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of the first section of the appropriation act of January 11th, , and respondent presuming that the Secretary of State had discharged his duties faithfully and honestly, in the premises, and not then suspecting Whiteley of fraudulent designs upon the public treasury, treated the certificate of the Secretary of State as a sufficient voucher for the correctness of the account, to authorize him to issue a warrant on the Treasurer in Whiteley’s favor for the sum so certified, without requiring further evidence or making an investigation of its correctness. Some time afterwards, respondent having cause to suspect that a fraud had been perpetrated upon the treasury, in the amount charged for printing the Acts, caused the accounttobe examined, and ascertained that there were overcharges in the items composing the account amounting in the aggregate to $, in specie, which having been paid to Whiteley in script, at cents on the dollar, made the over-payment amount to the sum of $, , of which Whiteley was notified, and informed that it would be deducted from his account for printing the journals. Having detected the fraud in the account of Whiteley for printing the Acts, the respondent then deemed it his duty t.o cause to be examined various accounts previously presented by Whiteley for public printing under his contract with the State, and for which the respondent had given him warrants on the Treasury, upon the certificates of the officers, whose duty it was to certify and examine such accounts, and which respondent had allowed on the faith of such certificates, he presuming proper vigilance and fidelity on the part of the officers making them, and suspecting no fraud; and on causing such examination to be made, respondent ascertained that Whiteley had been perpetrating a system of gross and flagrant frauds upon the Treasury, in making out his accounts for public printing. When the account in question certified by the Secretary of State for printing the journals was presented to the respondent, as Auditor, for his warrant, he objected to the item of $, , charged for printing the Appendix to the House Journal, and to which various objections are enumerated in the response, the substance of them being that the journal required by the constitution to be kept and published by the House, is, in the judgment of respondent, the daily record of its proceedings made up by its clerk, read in the presence of, and approved by the House, and finally signed by the presiding officer, attested by the clerk and deposited in the office of the Secretary of State; that the matters printed in the Appendix, were not part of the proceedings of the House, were not spread upon the journal, were not ordered by the House to constitute a part of the journal, or an appendix to it; nor was there any law, general or special, authorizing the printing of such documents as part of the journal: that all of the matters contained in the appendix, except the petition of the Attorney General, formed a part of the documents accompanying the Governor’s message, of which fifteen hundred copies had been printed previous to the meeting of the General Assembly, and there was for that reason no propriety in republishing them: that if the clerk of the House furnished Whiteley with copies of those documents, they were printed copies, not certified by the clerk to-be part of the journal: that it was Whiteley’s duty as public printer, to certify the account of the clerk for copying the journal, and that Whiteley, in the due performance of this duty, must have had the means of discriminating between the manuscript journal and extraneous matter. The respondent then proceeds to surcharge and falsify certain previous accounts which had been allowed and paid to the relator, upon the certificates of the Secretary of State, the Governor, and State Land Agent, according as-the work had been done for the different Executive offices; and so of the clerk of the House, and Secretary of the Senate, specifying in detail the overcharges for work done, the false charges for work not done, and the double charges for the same work: the-result of which is, according to what would be the respondent’s mode of auditing the account, if allowed to do so, that after deducting all those overpayments and the error of $, overpaid Whiteley for printing the Acts, and disallowing the charge-in the account in controversy, for printing the appendix as part of the journals, the relator, instead of having a just claim against' the State for $, , according to the certificate of the Secretary of State, would stand indebted to the State in the sum of’ $ for overpayments upon the various accounts for printing done under his contract, of which the respondent furnishes a recapitulation. While the respondent charges that these overpayments were procured by a series of fraudulent acts on the part of Whiteley, he disclaims all imputation against the integrity of the several officers before referred to, whose duty it was by law, to examine and certify to the correctness of his accounts. Though submitting to the court the mode, according to which, in his opinion, the account between the relator and the State ought to be stated and audited, the principle contended for by the respondent is, that the court has no power to control his judgment and decicision, as Auditor, in matters involving the consideration of issuable facts, upon which it is made his province to exercise a discretion by the duties of his office and the law of the land. He represents that Whiteley has left the State, and that he and his securities are insolvent: and even if solvent, it is doubtful, as he is advised, whether an action would lie against the securities for such overpayments; thus raising the question whether he, acting for the State, to whom Whiteley is shown to be indebted, ought not to be permitted to retain, by way of set-off, such amount in controversy, as is admitted to be justly due him for printing the journals. The relator demurred to this response, assigning various causes, all of which necessarily admitting the transactions narrated by him, resolve themselves into a denial of the principle contended for by the Auditor, and the basis upon which the entire response rests, namely, that by law and the duties of his office, he has a discretion, and which the courts cannot control by mandamus, to go behind the settlements of the present and all previous accounts of the public printer, and re-open and' investigate them, though examined and certified to be correct by the proper officers, appointed by law for that purpose. And all that part of the response, setting forth the facts and reasons why the Auditor has authority to disregard the certificate of the Secretary of State, vouching for the correctness of the account for printing the appendix to the journal, is demurred to upon the further ground that while it asserts that the matters printed in the appendix, were not, properly, any part of the journal, it does not deny that they were furnished to the relator to be printed as such by the cleric of the House, whose duty it was to do so, and to whose directions in that respect the public printer had to conform. The response being adjudged insufficient, and no further showing being made, the court below adjudged that a peremptory mandamus issue, and thereupon granted the prayer of the respondent for an appeal, and made an order that such appeal should operate as a stay of proceedings until the determination in the Supreme Court. It is desirable to waive any enquiry whether it be the intention or the policy of the statute, Digest, Title, Mandamus, secs. and , to make the allowance of writs of error or appeals from the decisions of the Circuit Courts on writs of mandamus, operating after notice as a stay of proceedings, pending the appeal or writ of error, demandable of right and issuing as a matter of course, or whether they are only to be allowed in the discretion of the appellate court, or whether it is designed to do away with all distinction as to appellate jurisdiction, between those cases where the relator demurs to the sufficiency of the return as at the common law, and those cases, where, traversing it under the statute, he elects to proceed for damages with like effect as if he had brought his action on the case for a false return; and to omit any notice of the refusal of the court below after the alternative writ was awarded, to permit the cause to be docketed and proceed in the name of the State npon the relation of Whiteley, because not examinable npon this appeal; and to disregard all exceptions to the response for informality. In considering the case upon its merits, it will be assumed, as it is so admitted, that all the accounts certified in favor of the relator, though by different officers, stand upon the same footing of lawful authority in those officers to examine and certify to their correctness. The first section of the act of January 11th, , making appropriation to pay for printing and distributing fhe Acts and Journals of the General Assembly, provides that, “All payments therefor shall be upon accounts certified by the Secretary of State, which accounts so certified, shall be sufficient vouchers for the Auditor.” The law, to which no exception will be implied, Featherston vs. Adams, Eng. , is that moneys appropriated are to be drawn from the Treasury upon the warrant of the Auditor of Public Accounts. That officer, Digest, Title Auditor and Treasurer, sec. , is made the general accountant of the State, and required to keep all public accounts, books, vouchers, documents, and all papers relating to the contracts of the State and its debts, revenue and fiscal affairs, not required by law to be placed in some other office, or kept by some other person. He can exercise no judicial function, Auditor vs. Davies, Ark. , but in the adjustment of claims against the State, he is empowered to take testimony or examine the parties, if he .thinks it necessary. By section of the same general law, all persons having claims against the State, are required to. exhibit the same with the evidence in support thereof to the Auditor, to be audited, settled and allowed, and this must be done within two years from the accrual of the claim. If allowed and there be a subsisting appropriation to pay the claim, the Auditor must give his warrant: if no money be appropriated, he is to grant to the claimant an official certificate of the amount allowed, which then awaits an appropriation. If the claimant be dissatisfied with the decision of the Auditor, he may require the Auditor to refer the same with his reasons to the General Assembly, or the claimant may bring suit against the State, the pi’ocess in such case b,eing served upon the Auditor, and the statute contemplates that suits by or against the State, shall be considered under his direction. If the claimant succeeds in obtaining a judicial ascertainment of a demand in his favor, it is made the duty of the Auditor to lay a copy of the judgment before the General Assembly, to the end, that an appropriation may be made to satisfy it. Such, in comprehensive terms, are the stututory provisions on the subject. It cannot be doubted that the Legislature has the power by law, to refer to her officers or agents, other than the Auditor, the settlement of accounts or claims against the State, and by whose decision, within the scope of their authority, the State may agree to become bound. It might be well to adhere to the policy of making the Auditor the general accountant of the State, and preserving under the supervision of one office, the'details of whose duties become systematized, the evidences and documents relating to the public finances. But there may be exceptions to such a policy. If the General Assembly deems it expedient to place at the disposal of the Governor, as the head of the Executive department, a contingent or secret service fund, the nature of the trust reposed in him implies that the Auditor should issue his warrants, upon the requisition of the Governor, without question or hindrance. The same principle might be applicable to the mode of auditing the ordinary contingent expenses of the judiciary; and with equal reason it would be made the imperative duty of the Auditor to issue his warrants for the pay and mileage of members, and contingent expenses of the two branches of the General Assembly, upon the certificate of such of their officers as might be appointed for that purpose. Because, though confidence, no matter where reposed, is liable to mistakes or wilful abuse, there is always some measure of responsibility attending such abuse, and it is of much greater consequence that the dignity and usefulness of each of the departments of the government should not be impaired by conferring upon any one officer belonging to either a discretion to withhold or delay the compensation of other public servants necessary for their subsistence. ""Where the Auditor, in the discharge of his appropriate duties* has a discretion in allowing or rejecting a claim against the State, and exercises it, his decision cannot be controlled or reviewed by mandamus. It appertains exclusively to the sovereign power to provide the mode and means bjr which the claims of public creditors are to be ascertained and liquidated, and without the express consent of the State allowing herself to be sued, such a case is not one of judicial cognizance. Nor does the submission of the State to an ordinary suit at law for her alleged indebtedness, change, in this respect, the theory of a mandamus* The assumption-of such a jurisdiction over the accounting officers of the treasury-, would not only disturb their regular business, but it would have the effect of drawing indirectly to the courts, the irresponsible power and impossible duty of regulating the fiscal affairs of the'government. But there is a marked distinction everywhere recognized between the exercise of discretion and a ministerial act, the performance of which is a plain and positive duty enjoined by law, and when essential to the enjoyment or completion of some public or private right, and no other adequate specific remedy is provided, the authorities concur in holding that a mandamus will lie, affording a prompt and efficient remedy, at the instance of any person interested, to compel its performance. If the Auditor should refuse to pass upon a claim presented to him, which the claimant desired to have done, so that if rejected he might be enabled either to bring suit against the State, or appeal to the General Assembly, we apprehend the jurisdiction would not be questioned, to compel him by mandamus to exercise his discretion in deciding upon the claim; and so, if requested by the claimant to refer the same with his reasons for rejecting it to the General Assembly. On the same principle, if the Auditor, after having allowed a claim, should refuse to issue his warrant, because in doubt whether the subject be embraced in the terms of any previous appropriation, the proper court, if called upon to interpret the law, would not hesitate to treat the issuance of the warrant in such case as a mere ministerial act of the Auditor, consequent upon his own decision and involving no discretion whatever. Byrd vs. Conway, Auditor, Ark. . Tully Ex parte, ib. . Those cases go farther, in holding that the Auditor will be compelled, by mandamus, not only to audit but to allow the salaries of public officers and agents, the amounts of which have been fixed by law and no legal excuse is shown for his refusal. See also Page vs. Hardin, B. Mon. . In Hawkins vs. the Governor, Ark. , it was held that a mandamus could not issue to the Governor, because being the chief executive of the State, a due respect for his station forbade an attempt to hold him, in that mode, amenable for his acts to the judiciary. But no such consideration has been extended to the Auditor ; for though belonging to the executive department, his acts are not those of the chief executive, since according to our political organization, he is not appointed by, or responsible to the Governor. It is a question of some difficulty whether the submission 'of the State to be sued by her creditors, affords an adequate remedy superseding the summary and specific one sought to be obtained by mandamus. The suit permitted against the State, is in the nature of an appeal from the adverse decision of the Auditor, and-must be an ordinary suit in form, and in substance a direct proceeding against the State by name. It was not designed to make the writ of mandamus a substitute for the action of debt or assumpsit, or a bill for an account. Here the specific relief asked for is the issuance of the Auditor’s warrant, the direct fruits of which may be to enable the relator to realize a mere money demand from the treasury: so that the difficulty suggested is forcibly presented. Our opinion is, that although the privilege of suing the State ought to influence the court in refusing to award-the writ, in all cases where it may be doubtful whether the officer or inferior magistrate has a discretion or acts ministerially, yet it does not take away the remedy where the distinction is clear, and the act to be done is purely ministerial, a duty enjoined by law, which the relator has a right to demand, though by the performance of it, the interests of the State may be remotely or consequentially affected. Because upon principle, and unless this be so, the Auditor could withhold the regular salary of any public officer; he could defeat the execution of the laws, by refusing to obey the requisition of the Governor upon the contingent fund; and by disregarding the certificate of the proper officer of either House, he might force members of the General Assembly to bring suits against the State for their per diem and mileage. It seems to be conceded in the argument, that upon the facts set up in the petition, none of the material allegations of which are denied by the response, the relator has shown himself entitled to the writ. The respondent sought to avoid the legal conelusion from those facts by going into an investigation of the series of accounts between the relator and the State'; and the question upon which the decision of this cause turns, is not whether, if the facts asserted by the respondent be true, the relator is legally or equitably entitled under his contract, to receive any further pa3rments from the State, but it is whether the Auditor has the right to set up those facts in this proceeding. Although no reason is perceived why the accounts of the public printer should not have been referred for settlement to the office of the Auditor, as coming within the sphere of his appropriate duties, the Legislature thought proper to refer them to the Secretary of State or other officers. The accounts so certified are made sufficient vouchers for the Auditor, for the issuance of his warrants, to the end that payment may be made. It is well settled that where an authority or discretion is conferred upon an officer, whether the duties be in their nature executive or judicial, his decision within the scope of his authority, though erroneous, is final and cannot be collaterally called in question. The judge or officer, if the decision has not been acted upon or passed beyond his control, may recall it if he believe it to be erroneous or made in mistake. When the Auditor examines an accouht, referred by law to his office for settlement, and makes an award in favor of the claimant, it is prima facie conclusive upon the State and all other public officers, because the government has agreed to become bound by his decision, he being responsible to the appointing power for any dereliction of duty. The same reasoning applies to an award made by the Secretary of State, or any other person selected by the State as her agent for that purpose: nor will a court undertake to control the discretion of one, any more than of the other. Because the Auditor is the general accountant, it does not follow, as we have seen, that special authority may not be delegated to other officers or agents, to audit accounts against the State. Those exceptions to his general duties cover a large portion of the public expenditures. Unless the power of revision is given by law, he does not derive it from the circumstance that a warrant must be issued by him. When the decision of the proper officer is certified to him, his act in issu-> ing the warrant is as purely ministerial as that of the Treasurer who pays it. Among the adjudged cases that might be cited in support of these views, it will be sufficient to refer to the elaborate one of Kendall vs. The United States, Peters , where Stockton & Stokes, having disputed claims for extra services under mail contracts, made with a previous Postmaster General, which his successor refused to admit, Congress at their instance passed an act by which the solicitor of the Treasury was empowered to settle and adjust their claims for extra services, and directing the Postmaster General to credit them with whatever sum or sums of money, if any, the solicitor should decree to be equitably due them. Mr. Kendall being notified of the award, refused to give credit for a part of the sum reported to be due to Stockton & Stokes, and upon their relation a peremptory mandamus was granted to compel him to enter a credit on the books of the Postoffice Department for the whole amount. The Supreme Court, in maintaining the jurisdiction to administer the law for the protection of individual rights under a constitutional government, use some remarkable language, reiterated in Decatur vs. Paulding, Peters , not called for in reference to the powers of the executive in this State, but establishing fully the principle laying at the foundation of the present case, that, though to be cautiously dealt with, it must always be a judicial question, whether the particular act involves executive discretion, or is a mere ministerial duty. The court had no hesitation in deciding that under that law the Postmaster General was vested with no discretion or control over the decisions of the solicitor, no appeal or review being provided by it: and that the entering of the credit was “a precise, definite act, purely ministerial, and about which the Postmaster General has no discretion whatever.” It can make no difference that here the act of the General Assembly making the submission to the Secretary of State, was passed in advance of the claim for services to be rendered ""by the relator under his contract. The strong position taken by the response is, that the relator having procured the settlement of the account in controversy and of previous accounts by fraud or deception, practiced upon the officers who certified them, the court ought not to aid him in obtaining the relief he now seeks in this or any other proceeding. Upon examination this will be found to be another phase of the same enquiry, whether the Auditor is estopped by the decision of the Secretary of State from urging the objection. The law made it the duty of the Secretary of State to adjust and settle the accounts of the public printer. If the Auditor had any implied power of revision, there must have been a corresponding duty resting upon him to exercise it; and then, according to his own showing, he would appear to have been repeatedly derelict in suffering accounts to pass into warrants without any investigation, trusting, as he did, to the correctness of the certificates of the officers who examined them. No such duty devolved upon the Auditor; and the construction of the law which acquits him of imputation, must also prove that the responsibility of certifying these accounts rested upon other public agents, and with which he had no concern. Here then the respondent asserts that there was fraud or mistake in a matter about which it was not his province to judge; while the certifícales of other agents, selected by the State for the purpose of examining and settling the accounts assert, and supposing them all to be involved in thesame enquiry, would continue to assert that they are correct as certified, and free from fraud or mistake. It is a plain proposition that the statement of the officer, having authority to bind the interests of the State, is to be received in preference to the assertion of the one to whom no such authority has been delegated. This court, in the County of Ouachita vs. Sanders, Eng. , where a Circuit Court had certified a bill of costs in a criminal prosecution to the county court for payment, though some of the items of charge allowed by the Circuit Court were of rather an extraordinary character, said: “So long as the order allowing the claim and certifying it to the county court remains, it is obligatory and conclusive as to the amount of the costs and charges •to be allowed.” And so it had been taken for granted in The County of Pulaski vs. Irvin, Ark. . No doubt, it would be proper for the Auditor, as a vigilant public servant, if he knew or suspected an error in an account certified to him, to refer it back to the certifying officer for correction or further enquiry before issuing his warrant: but he cannot overrule the decision of that officer by persisting in a refusal to abide by it. This conclusion, when arrived at, settles all other questions in the case really dependant upon it. As it regards the printing of the appendix, the probability is, from the references to the practice, made by counsel on either side, that documents have sometimes been inserted in the appendix, as often by accident or caprice of the clerks, as by the order of either House; and one of the beneficial results of this controversy may be, to induce the General Assembly to prescribe some definite and uniform rule on the subject. But for all the purposes of the present enquiry, the account presented by the relator appears to be doubly fortified, as to this item of charge, by the official sanction of the clerk of the House and the certificate of the Secretary of State. The refusal of the Auditor to issue his warrant cannot be sustained because of the right claimed to retain the amount of alleged previous overpayments to Whiteley. Independent of any objection to the re-opening of settled accounts, they all stand upon the same footing with the accountin controversy. If being regularly certified they were proper vouchers to the Auditor, they continue to be so. We have no statute .authorizing the Auditor to retain, by way of set-off, a debt due from a creditor of the State.; and he could only do so by way of deduction in stating and settling an account, which he is authorized to audit. Of course, if Whiteley has not complied with his contract, it is to be presumed that he and his securities are liable in an .action by the State for any breach of it: and that if overpayments have been made to him by mistake, they may be recovered back. If the set-off is claimed on the ground of their insolvency, the State occupying the position of any other suitor, who had contracted improvidently, it would have to be determined by judicial ascertainment. In a direct proceeding in chancery on behalf of the State, an injunction, if prayed for against Whiteley, could only be granted or perpetuated according to established rules of law and hv the decision of a competent court. If the Auditor has the right, claimed for him by virtue of his general powers and duties, of refusing to issue his warrant for payment of claims allowed by other officers, in whom had been vested by special laws a discretion to examine and adjust them, the converse of the proposition must also be true; and it would follow, if his revising power be admited, that the Auditor, in all such cases, must have an uncontrolled discretion of issuing his warrant in payment of claims which the proper accounting officer had rejected. In any view of the case, we conclude that the judgment ought to be affirmed.",legal_case,negative,negative,neutral,error
1862659,"Hill, McLean & Co., vs. Rucker","{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins, delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an action of assumpsit by Hill, McLean & Co , against the appellee. The declaration contains the common counts for goods sold and delivered, money paid, for interest and on account stated. The only evidence adduced to sustain the action was the deposition of a witness, taken in New Orleans, who states, “that the account marked A, hereto annexed, showing a balance due to Hill, McLean & Co., of five hundred and forty-seven dollars and fifty cents, by Edmond P. Rucker is correct;” and he also annexed to his deposition the invoices marked B, and three hills of lading marked , and . The same witness further stated that it is customary for commission merchants to charge eight per cent, interest on open accounts. The ac count exhibited shows the total amount of debits, as stated by the witness, but there are no credits appearing, so as to make that amount a balance, or from which any recognition of the correctness of the account by the defendant could be inferred. The exhibit B consists of bills of goods, some of which appear to have been consigned to A. Hays, Napoleon, for account of E. P. Ruck-er, Rucker’s Landing, Arkansas river; and another portion to J. A. McAlister & Co., Nashville, for account of E. P. Rucker. The copies exhibited of the bills of lading, show that certain goods were shipped by Hill, McLean & Co., at New Orleans, some of them on the Cotton Plant, marked “E. P. Rucker,” and consigned to Hays, at Napoleon, and another portion on the Harry Hill, marked “M. L. Rucker, Murphreesboro, Tennessee,” consigned to McAlister & Co., at Nashville. In the account, the items are charged during the month of July , the invoices are without date, and the bills of lading are dated in November and December, . The plaintiffs also proved, by another witness, that the defendant, Rucker, was a planter on the Arkansas river in the year . This being all the evidence in the case, the court instructed the jury, that they should find for the defendant, unless the plaintiffs have proven either that the defendant ordered the goods, or that he received them, and that the shipment of the goods and taking bills of lading therefor, in the manner shown by the deposition referred to, is not sufficient evidence of a receipt of them by the defendant, but there must be proof of an actual receipt of the goods by him, if they were not ordered. Such, in substance, was the instruction given, the propriety of which is not questioned; but it appears that the court, in response to an- enquiry from the jury, told them, that the deposition was evidence, but not sufficient for them to find a verdict for the plaintiffs, who should have proved that the defendant had either ordered or received the goods: and it is argued, for the appellants that such- charge, in- the terms given,, was- an invasion by the court below of the province of the jury. According to the settled practice in this State, the court has no power to order a peremptory non-suit, Martin & Van Horne vs. Webb, Ark. . Ringo vs. Field, Eng. , but the practice has prevailed for the court, sitting as a jury, or the jury under instructions from the court, to find as in case of non-suit, which is a determination of the case upon the merits as presented by the evidence, a bar to any future action for the same cause, and to which error lies, Fagan vs. Faulkner, Ark. . Cocke vs. Brogan, ib. . Palmer & Southmayd vs. Ashley & Ringo, ib. , though the correctness of it was doubted in Goodrich vs. Fritz, Ark. , and in Carr vs. Crain, Eng. , repeated in The State use &c., vs. Roper, ib. , the court said, “ The correct motion is to instruct the jury that if the evidence has not proved a matter necessary to be proven, they must find for the defendant,” though in the two last cases mentioned, the distinction does not appear to be noticed, that to order a non-suit is to say the jury shall not pass on the evidence, while the letter authority is that the court has not this power, and that the plaintiff has the right to have the jury pass on his case, and to be concluded if he will by the judgment, which being final entitles him to a revision in the appellate court. But to instruct the jury to find as in, case of non-suit, is only the opinion of the court.that the plaintiff has failed to make out his case in evidence, and so far from taking the case from the jury is every way favorable to the plaintiff, because it is analogous to a demurrer to evidence, where all-legitimate presumptions of fact are to be indulged in favor of the evidence. There is therefore no real discrepancy between the cases adverted to, and they all tend to establish, that however dangerous it may be for a defendant to ask the court to instruct the jury to' find as in case of non-suit, or that the plaintiff has failed to make out his case in evidence, it is no assumption of power for the court-to give such an instruction, the only question being whether it was properly given. In this case the real truth may be, that the defendant was resisting payment of a just demand, and that the apparent inconsistencies in the deposition could have been reconciled and any defect of proof supplied by further testimony; but according to the case presented on the record, the jury could not-have been justified by the evidence in finding a verdict for the plaintiffs, and consequently the expression of such an opinion by the court was erroneous. The statement of the witness who deposed that the account exhibited showing a certain balance due the plaintiffs from the defendant was correct, might have been honestly made, as appearing to him from the books of the plaintiffs; but it cannot be stretched to mean that the witness was personally cognizant of the transactions about which he testified, or to amount to proof that the defendant, not shown to have received the goods, had ordered or bargained for them, so as to be1come chargeable for their value by the delivery of them to a carrier.

1862661,Hynson vs. Noland,"{'name_abbreviation': 'Ark.', 'id': 8808, 'name': 'Arkansas Supreme Court'}",1854-01,Ark.,"Mr. Chief Justice Watkins delivered the opinion of the Court. This was an action of assumpsit brought by the plaintiff against the defendant in error, for money had and received. It appears that, in the spring of , the plaintiff, being appointed Receiver of Public Moneys for the United States, at the Bates-ville Land Office, employed Aaron W. Lyon to transact the business, constituting him general agent for that purpose. It was especially expressed in the instrument, or power of attorney executed by Hynson to Lyon, that the latter was to have the entire controll of all moneys paid into the office, and was to disburse the same according to law, and in that instrument, the receipt, controll and management of all moneys accruing to the office were guarantied by Hynson to Lyon, as a means of securing him against all loss or damage on account of any default of Hynson as Receiver, Lyon being one of the securities of Hynson on his official bond. By virtue of that appointment, Lyon attended to all the business of the office for Ilynson, and in his name as Receiver. Hynson was removed in April, , when the defendant, Noland, was appointed to the office in his stead. After that period Lyon continued to do the duties devolving on Plynson as late Receiver, in closing up the business of the office and until it was turned over to the government. By request of Lyon the defendant, Noland, included in tii '■ estimates lor his first draft to be received from the government on account of expenses, &c., the sum of $ , being a balance due lo Hynson as late Receiver, consisting of various items for money expended and a residue of salary and percentages, of which a statement was rendered. Nol and accordingly received a draft, including what was due Hynson, and on the 22d of July, .., paid the amount over to Lyon, as agent for him. Lyon appropriated the money in part to pay the expenses included in his statement rendered to No-land; $ he retained for compensation due to him by Hynson, when he went out of office, and for which sum Hynson had given him a due bill or memorandum, dated on the 15th of April, , and expressed to be payable “on next draft,”- apd the residue of it he applied as a credit on another note which he held against Hynson. Noland was aware that Lyon had acted as agent for Hynson, and being such had transacted all the business of the office for him, and paid over the money in question 'to him as agent, he producing one of Hynson’s blank signatures, of which he hadcontroll, and over which a receipt or voucher for it was written, Lyon adding to the signature the words “late Receiver,” that being the style customary with the Department in corresponding with a former Receiver. The plaintiff asked the court sitting as a jury to declare it as law and governing thiá case, that the agency which he gave to Lyon to act for him was confined to the time that the plaintiff was in office as Receiver, and that if defendant paid the money due the plaintiff to Lyon, without authority to do so, other than the general authority which Lyon had to transact the business of the office for Hynson as Receiver, it was no defence to the action — which the court refused to do, but on the contrary declared its opinion of the law applicable to the case tobe, that so long as Lyon acted as Hynson’s agent, without any revocation of his agency, his acts as ^tgent were binding upon Hynson, and the payment of the money to him as such agent was a good defence to Noland. Upon that exception arises the only question of law reserved in the court below or argued here for theplaintiffin error. Without regard to the subsequent motion of the plaintiff for new trial, the effect of which would be to let in the consideration of any inequitable circumstances attending his claim and enable this court, though in doubt if the court below had not erred in its opinion of the law, to affirm the judgment, if upon the whole record it appeared to be right, it seems quite plain that the authority given to Lyon to act as agent, was in the nature of a power coupled with an interest, it being for the protection of himself and the other securities of Hynson, and was consequently irrevocable so long as there remained any money of the office to be disbursed or accounted for to the government after Hynson’s removal. Though the securities might not have incurred any liability to the government in case Hynson himself had received the money in question, yet so far as Lyon was concerned, his right to receive and disburse all moneys accruing to the office, was the consideration for which he became security and undertook the agency. He,'as Hynson’s agent and after his removal, settled withHhe government and paid over to the successor, the public moneys for which the late receiver was accountable-, and upon the case made in evidence it would be a narrow and technical construction of the agent’s authority to hold that it did not extend to the after formality of receiving from the government the arrearages due to the principal, and out of which the agent was entitled to receive his compensation. And upon the precise question of law made by the instruction it was correct as given, because if Hynson, after his removal, permitted Lyon to act as his agent in closing up the business of the office, Hynson, until a revocation of such authority, would be bound by the acts -of his agent without reference to any previous appointment.
