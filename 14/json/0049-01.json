The Circuit Court, on motion of the appellee, dismissed the appeal because the appellant had filed no bond for the costs of such appeal. From that decision the administrator has appealed to this court.\nNo bond for costs is required on appeals from the Probate to the Circuit Courts. The 3d section of the act of January 4th, 1849, applies only to appeals from the county courts, as decided in Biscoe vs. Madden, 7 Eng. 765, overruling the case of Morrow vs. Walker, 5 Eng. 569;\nThe judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to proceed therein according to law.",
