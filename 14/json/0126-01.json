The same pleadings were filed, the same decision made with regard to them: the same evidence offered in both and the same decree; so that the decision of the case of the complainants against the heirs of Thomas Dooley, will be held as decisive of all the questions which arose in this.\nThe court below erred in dismissing complainant\u2019s bill, and in decreeing costs against them ; and for this error the decree must be set aside and reversed, and the cause remanded to the court below, with instructions to ascertain the proportionate part which the defendants should refund, out of their specific legacy, and render a decree for the same in favor of complainants, and if necessary to take additional proofs touching the sum to be re\u2019 funded.",
