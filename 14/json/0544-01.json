The court ordered him to be fined in the sum of fifty dollars and to stand committed until the fine and costs be paid, &c. He took a bill of exceptions, prayed an appeal and entered into recognizance before the court below for stay of execution.\nThe disposition manifested by the Circuit Court, to cause to be stated upon the record, fairly and truly, for the protection of the person adjudged to be in contempt, the grounds and reasons for the same, and the substance of which ought to be set forth in the warrant of commitment, is every way commendable. But as held in Cossart vs. The State, at this term, the appeal and supersedeas, if allowable, would virtually set at naught the power \u00f3f a Circuit Court to punish summarily for contempt in any case.\nAppeal dismissed.",
