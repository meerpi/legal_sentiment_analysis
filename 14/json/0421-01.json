It is only when there are no kindred, either paternal or maternal, capable of inheriting, and next before it escheats, that real estate descends from the husband to the wife, or vice versa, (Dig. ch. 56, sec. 7). It would be easy to show, by enlarging upon this view of the subject, that if the widow could take one-half of the land absolutely, and not a doWer -estate in it for life only, the Legislature had really achieved much less than half they evidently designed by the system of descents fthey set on foot.\nThe application is denied.\nWatkins, C. J., not sitting.",
