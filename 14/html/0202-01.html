The evidence on the second trial, if <em>not </em>identically, is at least substantially the same as reported. It has become the settled law of this court, that a refusal to grant a new trial, on the general ground that the verdict is contrary to law and evidence, will not be reviewed, unless there is a total lack of evidence upon one or more points necessary to <em>the </em>main<a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>tainance of the action, or making out the defence.

We would not invade their constitutional authority, but at the sam√© time we would not have it understood that they are final arbiters of life, liberty and property.</p>
