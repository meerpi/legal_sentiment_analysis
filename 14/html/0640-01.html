It does not recognize the right of the complainant to become a witness in his own behalf, but to compel the defendant to become a witness in the cause, to the extent of a response to every <em>allegation in </em>the bill, and, in general, to confess or deny every one of those, the admission oí the truth of which may entitle the complainant to his legitimate relief. The effect of a total failure to answer, is an admission that the whole bill is true, if the defendant continues in this contempt, of the consequences of which he was warned originally before this effect was absolute; of which there are equivalent provisions in our statute. But it does not follow from this, that a partial failure to answer admits the fact unanswered to be true, without any warning at all. On the contrary, if upon exceptions sustained to such an answer, the defendant fails to answer further, instead of the part unanswered being taken as true at all as such, the whole bill is taken <em>pro confesso </em>generally; precisely as if no answer at all had been offered, <em>(Jopling vs. Stewart, </em>4 <em>Ves. </em>619; <em>Turner vs. Gray, ib. in note, </em>and other cases there cited;) and thus the defendant is allowed time and opportunity for repentance as <a id="p651" href="#p651" data-label="651" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*651</a>before. In harmony with this is the formula of reservation, at the commencement of the answer, which it is said in 2 <em>Mad. Ch. </em>333, was probably intended to prevent a conclusion that the de^ fendant having submitted to answer the bill, admitted everything which by his answer he did not, in express terms, controvert. And also the rule of allowing the plaintiff to except to an answer for insufficiency, not only when the defendant fails to discover, but when he fails to admit or deny, or evades any material allegation.

      <a id="p656" href="#p656" data-label="656" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*656</a>“la the case of <em>Field vs. </em>Holland, this precise question was not before the court; and the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall only goes to the point, that the answer of a defendant, through whom the co-defendant claims, is evidence <em>in favor </em>of sdeh co-defendant, as to matters which both were called on to answer, in relation to transactions which took place <em>before </em>the sale to such co-defendant. -It may perhaps be inferred from the language of the Chief Justice in that ease, that if the answer of Holland had admitted the facts charged in the complainant’s bill, instead of denying them, it could have been used as evidence <em>against </em>his co-defendant, who had purchased under the judgment in his favor .againt Cox. But there certainly was nothing to authorize the reporter, in the syllabus of the decision in that case, to state, as ,a point decided by the court, that the answer of one-defendant is evidence <em>against </em>other defendants claiming through him. In the case of <em>Osborne vs. The U. S. Bank, </em>the question arose as to how far the answer of one treasurer of the State of Ohio, was .evidence against his successor in office, as to the identity of funds taken from the Bank by a former treasurer; both being joined as defendants in the same bill. And in reference to the principle of evidence, that the answer of one defendant cannot be read in evidence against another, Ch. J. Marshall says, “This is generally, but not universally true. Where one defendant succeeds to another, so that the right of the one devolves on the other, and they become privies in estate, the rule is not admitted to apply. Thus, if an ancestor die pending a suit, and the proceedings be revived against his heir', or if a suit be revived against an executor or administrator, the answer of the deceased person, or any other evidence establishing any other fact against him, might be read also against the person who succeeds to him.” And it certainly seems to have been the opinion of the court in that case, that these principles, the correctness of which no one can dispute, were applicable to the case, of an answer put in by a defendant, who had parted with all interest in the subject matter of litigation, previous to the commencement of a suit, to one who was afterwards made a co-defendant with him in such suit. But there <a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>is a manifest difference between that case and the case supposed in the opinion of the learned Chief Justice. For in the case supposed, the ancestor or of the deceased party, is an admission made by him while he was owner of the subject matter of litigation and was such as may be given in evidence against any person claiming title under him subsequent to such admission. And upon the same principle, if a bill is taken as confessed against a defendant before his death, and the suit is subsequently revived against his heir, or personal representative, they must apply to vacate the order taking the bill as confessed, if they wish to controvert the allegations in the bill, or set up any defence except such as has arisen subsequent to that order. For the sufficiency of the bill to be taken as confessed against him, was an admission by the original defendant, while he was alone interested in the subject matter of the litigation, that the allegations in the complainant’s bill were true, and that he had no valid defence to the claim made by the complainant, except such as appeared from the bill itself. The question, however, now under consideration, did not necessarily arise in the case of <em>Osborn vs. The U. S. </em>Bank, because the answer of Sullivan, the successor of Currie, contained a distinct admission that he received the money in controversy from Currie, his predecessor in office, who informed him at the time he delivered the money that it was the money which had been taken from the bank — that answer was therefore <em>of itself on </em>idence of the identity of the funds — for it contained evidence of the declaration of the former treasurer, made at the time he parted with the money to his successor. It was not therefore evidence of a declaration of the treasurer, after he had parted with all his interest in the fund to the defendant Sullivan. And as I understand the case, the decision of the court is placed upon that ground: though it is evident the opinion of the learned Chief Justice, was that the answer of Currie, under the circumstances of the case, was admissible in evidence as against a co-defendant.”</p>

If so, although the learned chancellor is doubtless to be sustained in his understanding of the true ground upon which the court decided the cause — that of the answer of Sullivan alone, whereby all that is said of the admissibility of Currie’s answer, is left as the dictum only of the Chief Justice — his impressions as to the extent of the view's of 'the latter would be too latitudinous.

The language of the court is as follows: ‘Neither is it to be admitted that the answer of Holland is not testimony against the plaintiffs. He is the party against whom the fact, that the judgments were discharged, is to be established, and against whom it is to operate. This fact, when established, it is true, affects the purchasers also; but it affects them consequentially and through him. It affects them as representing him. Consequently, when the fact is established against or for him, it binds them. The plaintiffs themselves call upon Holland for a discovery. They aver that the judgments were discharged and expressly require him to answer this allegation. They cannot now be allowed to say that this answer is no testimony.’ It will be seen that the reasoning of the court is at first somewhat indefinite; we presume for the purpose of avoiding the very inference which has been erroneously drawn from it. Its object was <em>to </em>show, in <em>the </em>first place, that the fact of the payment or non-payment of the judgment, <em>when properly established, </em>would not only be evidence for or against the plaintiff therein, but would operate for or against the purchasers, (who were the co-defendants) under the authority thereof; at the same time <em>avoiding </em>the designation of the <em>mode </em>by which that <em>fact, </em>whether affirmative or negative, <em>ivas </em>to <em>be established; </em>and then to show that in the case before the court it was established negatively by the responsive answer of the defendant, Holland.

The two promissory notes payable to John Angle, were taken from his possession by the messenger under the fiat, and delivered to the complainant, who was the official and creditors’ assignee of the bankrupt: and the notes not being endorsed, the complainant could not recover upon them at law against Pledger. Pledger answered admitting his liability to John Angle, but ignored altogether the case of the complainant, not admitting that the money, as alleged, was a part of the assets of the bankrupt, and submitted that if the court should be of opinion that the complainants were entitled to the notes, or the beneficial interest in them, that then he ought to be considered a stakeholder and be allowed his costs. Under an English statute, John Angle was served at Boulogne with a subpoena to appear and answer the bill. Afterwards the vice chancellor made an order that the service of a notice of motion upon John Angle at Boulogne, should be good service. The notice was accordingly served, and the motion then made, (founded upon affidavits as against John Angle) that Pledger should pay the money into court. John Angie did not appear, and the motion came on to be heard on the affidavits as against him, and upon the answer of Pledger to the bill already in. The Vice Chancellor in granting this motion, said: “The defendant Pledger admits his liability to John Angle, and ignores only the question of right as between the plaintiff and John Angle. If John Angle were not a party to this suit, the plaintiffs would have to join issue with Pledger upon their right as against John Angle, and would be bound to prove that right as against Pledger.

That it is with John Angle, the plaintiffs have to litigate that question is clear from the consideration, that an admission by John Angle in his answer, of the plaintiff’s right as against himself, would entitle the plaintiff to a decree according to the prayer of the bill. At the same time it is clear that John Angles’ answer would not, technically speaking, be evidence against Pledger. So, if the bill were taken <em>pro confesso </em>against John Angle, <em>or </em>if the plaintiffs’ rights, as against John Angle, were proved by evidence not receivable against Pledger. The consequence of both John Angle and Pledger being parties to the suit is, that a decree in the plaintiffs’ favor will decide the case between the co-defendants. <em>(Chamley vs. Lord Dunsancy, </em>2 <em>Sch. &amp; Lef. </em>718. <em>Farquharson vs. </em>Seton, 5 <em>Russ, </em>per Lord Eldon,) I might refer to analogous cases, in which a disclaimer by one defendant has enabled the plaintiff to sustain his suit against another defendant; the principle being, that after a decree founded upon the disclaimer, the court will not permit the disclaiming party to open the question anew, <em>(Leathes vs. Newitt, </em>3 <em>Ea. &amp; Go. </em>848. <em>Mounsey vs. Burnham, </em>1 <em>Hare </em>21.”) After showing him that the case before him was unlike the case of <em>Doubless vs. </em>Flint, (1 <em>Myln. &amp; Cr. </em>502,) the Vice Chancellor then concludes with the remark: “I want no evidence but what his answer gives me, and I take nothing from him but what he admits he has no right to hold as against John Angle. Against John Angle the case is established, for the present purpose at least, by the affidavits, to the l'eception of which he could not object.”</p>

But the same principle governs both cases. That it is to say, in neither was the answer read in evidence <em>against </em>the co-defendant. In the Massachusetts case it was not against him, because he set up no right of his own, and the answer was against the complainant and in favor of the responding defendant, in whose right he made his defence. So, in the English case, it was not against the co-defendant, Pledger, as the Yice Chancellor labors to show by several illustrations, among others the case of a disclaiming defendant, while he dis-. tinctly recognizes the rule, that the answer of one defendant cannot be read in evidence against another; and concludes by repeating the idea, which he had been enforcing throughout: “I want no evidence against Pledger, but what his answer gives me, and I take nothing from him but what he admits he has no right to hold as against John Angle.”</p>

The passage in his work to which we allude is this: “In cases, however, where the rights of the plaintiff, as against one defendant, are only prevented from being-complete by some question between the plaintiff and a second defendant, it seems that the plaintiff is permitted to read the answer of such second defendant for the purpose of completing his claim against the first;” and it was cited by this court as one of <a id="p664" href="#p664" data-label="664" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*664</a>the authorities for admitting an exception to the general rule in the case of <em>Whiting &amp; Slark vs. Beebe et al. </em>(7 <em>Eng. R. </em>561:) the other authorities cited being <em>Field vs. Holland, Osborne vs. The Bank of the U. States, </em>and <em>Morse vs. Royal, </em>12 <em>Ves. R. </em>355; which latter was a case where Green, a part of whose answer was received as evidence, was a defendant in the double capacity of executor of one deceased party, and as residuary legatee of another, between the estates of which deceased parties there was a complication of interest; and Lord Erskine allowed so much of his answer to be read, relating to his capacity of executor as was not in favor of his interest as a residuary legatee. And the same authorities had been before cited in the case of <em>Barraque &amp; wife vs. Siter, Price &amp; Co., </em>4 <em>Eng. R. </em>545, where it was said that the rule of exclusion did not apply to cases where the defendant claims through him, whose answer is offered in evidence. But holding, as we must now do, after a more careful and thorough examination of the question, in which we have closely scrutinized these authorities, that the answer of one defendant cannot be read in evidence against his co-defendant, unless he refers to such answer as correct, or is so connected with the answering party as to be bound, under the ordinary rules of law, by his confessions, declarations or admissions, it is proper for us to remark that the doctrine of those cases upon this point must be so modified as to conform to the views now expressed.</p>

Whether the party making the admission and the party against whom it is offered, be connected by a joint ownership or liability, or by the transmission of a several title, from the former to the latter, the interest of the party making the admission must be a subsisting one at the time of the admission. If at the time of making it he has parted with his interest, his admissions are not legal evidence against him to whom it has passed. Upon this point the authorities are clear and numerous, and without exception or qualification in the application of the rule to vendors and assignors. Indeed the Supreme Court of New York, in the cases of <em>Beach vs. </em>Wise, 1 <em>Hill’s R. </em>612, and <em>Starke vs. </em>Boswell, 6 <em>Hill R. </em>495, have gone beyond this, and held that the admission of a former owner of personal property, or of a chose in action, even if made before he parted with his title, are not evidence against his vendee. This would, seem, however, to be an invasion upon established principles of evidence.</p>

Upon this ground then as well as that already considered as to costs, this decree must be reversed, and as the record does not furnish the materials upon which we can found another decree, which would reach all the merits of this case, we shall order the bill to be dismissed without prejudice to the rights of the complainants, and at their costs; that the appellant, Blakeney, may at once have the benefit of his writ of possession that has already been affirmed to Mm by this court.</p>
