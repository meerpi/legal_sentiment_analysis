Soon afterwards the boat left the Ohio, and in the latter part of August, was brought by Fisher into the Arkansas, -where she continued to run. While navigating the Arkansas river the boat became indebted to the defendants, Merrick &amp; Fenno, residing at Little Rock, for advances and supplies furnished in this State, amounting to near four hundred dollars; and -on the 6th of October, 1847, they took a bill of sale of the boat from Fisher, expressed to be in consideration of their having just ■claims against the boat, which he was desirous should be paid. The bill of sale contained a stipulation to the effect, that when .all the claims then held by Merrick &amp; Fenno should be paid and satisfied, they would in good faith, re-sell, re-convey, and re-deliver the boat, her engine, tackle, &amp;c., to Fisher, on his reasonable request, and in the meantime render accounts of the business of the boat, or permit him to inspect its books on request. This instrument, which clearly was a mortgage security, was never filed for record. It is fully proved that Merrick &amp; Fenno, notwithstanding the positive denial and averments in their answer, immediately upon the execution of the bill of sale, took possession of the boat and commenced running her, for the purpose of <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>re-imbursing what she owed them, and that such was the intention of the parties in executing the bill of sale, is inferable from its tenor.</p>

In the first place the the distinction between the different kinds of lien is to be observed. The common law lien is a right to retain a thing until some <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>claim upon it is satisfied, and if possession be given up the lien is lost. Statutory liens, among which are chattel mortgages, do not depend upon possession of the thing. They import a right to prior satisfaction out of the property bound by the lien, and being the creatures of positive law, are usually regiilated by a system of registry, operating as constructive notice; so that they take effect, and are to be satisfied according to priority of record! A maritime lien does not depend upon possession or registry of any contract which confers the lien. It excludes the idea of possession or registry. Nor do such liens take effect according <em>to </em>priority of time; in many instances, when they come to be satisfied the order of priority is inverted. The maritime law is part of the law of nations, a peculiar system supposed to be based on principles of the most enlightened equity, and proceeding according to rules of its own wholly unlike the common law. It concerns vessels which navigate the seas,- and the classes of persons engaged in navigating, or who contract in respect of such vessels! The maritime lien is one of the necessities attending commerce between foreign countries. It is a claim upon the vessel and the lien consists in the right to enforce it by seizure or proceeding <em>in rent. </em>Unlike the liens given by the local law of any nation, which if respected out of its jurisdiction, are only so by comity, this light to satisfaction out of the vessel, where it exists,' adheres to and follows her everywhere. So the judgment of the admiralty court <em>in rem </em>is of universal obligation, and conclusive upon all persons interested in the subject of its adjudication.</p>

A claimant of the vessel answered that she had been sued and seized in a court of Ohio under the statute of that State, for supplies furnished to her at Cleveland after the 20th of September, 1849, in which suits judgr ments were rendered in February, 1850, upon which the vessel was sold in March following, and under that sale he derived his title.

It might be said, that though the Ohio statute gives no lien, it gives the claim against the vessel, and the right to seize in satisfaction of that claim; and this is the substance of a maritime lien. The rightto proceed against the <em>res </em>in admiralty, is called a lien, but it is by no means an absolute or unqualified right of preference. For it is a settled principle of the maritime law, though the rules on the subject rest much in discretion and are not clearly defined, that all such liens ought to be enforced by suit within a reasonable time, and they may be waived, postponed, or lost by neglect. The leading idea which pervades these local statutes is, that the boat and the owner are distinct from each other, so that the boat <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>js liable, as it were apon her own contracts, or for her own torts. The master or owner may be liable <em>in </em>personam, for the same, ,and the boat may be liable for the general debts of the owner; but the boat is first liable for her own debts, which, by analogy •with the maritime law, ought to follow her every where, and without regard to any sale, or incumbrance upon her by contract of the owner, into the hands of a purchaser with or without notice.</p>
    <p id="b386-5" data-blocks='[["BL_386.5",386,[187,792,1194,705]]]'>But admitting that the policy of the Ohio statute is to confer a lien, though it does not do so in express terms, there are opposing reasons conclusive to our minds, why such a lien should not be specifically enforced in this forum, in preference to any subsequent lien or liability,, valid by the laws of this State, which has accrued against the same vessel, whilst engaged in navigating our waters. In coming to this conclusion we are not influenced by the refusal of the Ohio courts to acknowledge a reciprocal obligation to enforce similar liens, which accrued in other States. For that matter, the amendment to the statute of Ohio in 1848, allowing foreigners to pursue in that State the remedy against boats given by her own law, is inconsistent with the idea of enforcing a specific lien which accrued under a foreign law.</p>

Because the admiralty law is one of universal obligation, pervading all countries where its rules are in theory at least, the same. If, therefore, the courts of this State could be called on to enforce, by analogy to the maritime law, a lien upon a boat or vessel, which accrued in Ohio, we would not do so upon any rule of comity between States, foreign, or in some respects foreign to each other. We should enforce it, not because the local law of Ohio had given the lien; but because the maritime law or usage gave it. Wo question ought to arise of conflict between the laws of this ,or a foreign State, or whether we would enforce such lien, provided it did not interfere with the rights of <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>our own citizens, but because the lien, valid in one place, is valid every where, and followed the vessel into this State. Upon the same principle we should respect a judgment <em>in </em>rem, with all its conclusive consequences, pronounced in the court of an'other State. But by act of Congress, in 1845, the admiralty jurisdiction of the district courts was extended over the lakes and rivers connecting the same. The constitutionality of this act was sustained by the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of <em>'The propeller Genesee Chief vs. Fitzhugh, </em><a href="/citations/?q=12%20Howard%20450" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="12 Howard 450">12 <em>Howard, </em>450</a>, a decision fraught with the most important results. The court, overruling the case of <em>the Jefferson, </em>held that the grant of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction was of the subject matter over public navigable waters, where commerce maybe carried on between different States or nations, and not according to the accidental defininition of it in England, where tide water and navigable water are, with unimportant exceptions, if any, synonymous terms.Upon the same distinction the States had not hesitated to extend their rights of sovereignty over inland navigable streams. The decision in 12 <em>Howard, </em>was the unavoidable consequence of admitting the several States to be sovereign and foreign to each other, in respect of all powers and jurisdictions, not delegated to’ the Federal Union.</p>

If this be so, it is difficult to conceive how any vestige of such jurisdiction (apart from disputes about its confines) could exist in the' State courts. The act of 1845, apparently framed as a cautious-experiment adapted to the exigencies of commerce upon the lakes,, does not confer it upon them, but only leaves to suitors the option, which they had under the judiciary act of 1789, of pursuing' any concurrent remedies that may be afforded by the State laws.But those are common law remedies, and though moulded by statute to resemble admiralty proceedings, the lien is local and the' sentence of condemnation upon it can have no more extra terri<a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>torial operation than a discharge under a State bankrupt law, or a judgment <em>in rem, </em>upon an ordinai-y attachment suit, which, however conclusive upon persons and property found within the State, would not conclude the paramount title of any one beyond the jurisdiction, and who could not be made subject to it. In the absence of legislation by Congress, now certainly much needed, extending the admiralty jurisdiction over our western rivers, it would be unwise and impolitic for the State courts to assume any such jurisdiction, dependant on the caprice o r vicissitudes of local legislation. The decisions of the State courts, proceeding according to the course of the common law, and without any common appellate tribunal to harmonize inevitable conflicts, would only render more insecure the titles to the vast amount of property passing between different States. The owner of a vessel in such case would seldom realize its value, because the purchaser could not know whether it was free from incumbrance. The only safety is found to be in the settled aversion of the common law, which couples the idea of a lien with possession, to all restrictions, in the shape of secret or contingent liens, upon the alienation of personal property.</p>

In every view of this case, we must say, that if the Ohio claimants, now before the court, had any lien by the law of that State, it was lost when they suffered the boat to depart beyond the jurisdiction of Ohio.</p>
