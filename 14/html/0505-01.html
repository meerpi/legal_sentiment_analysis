Mrs. Pryor; and that Pryor held continued possession of her until 1835 or 1836, with the exception of a year or two about 1830, when Pryor’s father held the negro in possession. In the fall of 1836, Matthew Ryburn removed from Tennessee to Texas, and on his way received the negro woman from Pryor and took her to Texas with him, Pryor furnishing her with a horse to ride. On the road to Texas Matthew Ryburn called her Pryor’s negro. She was hired for the year 1837, as Pryor’s negro, with the rest of his negroes. In the year 1838, Pryor and his father-in-law made a crop together, and the negro woman was put in as Pry- or’s property with his other negroes, and Pryor received one-third of the crop. They continued thus to live and crop together till about February, 1843, when Matthew Ryburn, having moved away, sent his son, Montgomery Ryburn, who came with a gun and took the negro woman forcibly from Pryor. After this, Matthew Ryburn kept the negro in possession till the 1st January,. 1844, when he executed a bill of sale for her and her child Maria, to the defendant, for $750, and delivered them to him Since 1826 the negro woman has had three children, now in possession of the defendant. Pryor also introduced a witness to prove that in 1837 or 1838, Matthew Ryburn declared more than once that the negro woman was the property of Pryor or Pryor’s wife. The competency of the evidence of this witness was objected to by Ryburn, but overruled by the court and the evidence permitted to go to the jury.</p>

But if there was no such concealment on the part of Ryburn, either actual or constructive, he might reclaim the property after such sale, to the same extent as before, whether the property remained in the hands of the purchaser at such sale, or in the hands of a subsequent purchaser.”</blockquote>

    <p id="b512-9" data-blocks='[["BL_512.9",512,[155,1602,1192,541]]]'>ist. The court below, in striking from the files the defendant’s plea of the statute of limitations of three years, committed no error. We think it clear the period of three years does not apply to an action of trover. This case does not come within section 6, of the Revised Statutes, in relation to limitations. “Trover is not an action ior <em>taking </em>or injuring goods or chattels. It goes on the ground of a <em>finding </em>and conversion.” The defendant having filed his plea of <em>five </em>years in bar, the plea applicable to this case, the court decided correctly, in striking the other plea of three years from the files.</p>
    <p id="b512-10" data-blocks='[["BL_512.10",512,[154,2154,1193,155]],["BL_513.1",513,[163,341,1209,1261]]]'>2d. It appears that during the trial, the plaintiff, to prove the gift of the negro, offered the declarations of the donor made subpequent to the alleged gift, but before the donor parted with his <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>interest to the defendant. The defendant, in order to rebut this, and to show that the negrb was merely <em>loaned </em>and not <em>given, </em>offered the declarations of the donor made during the same time. The court below received as evidence the declarations of the donor in favor of the plaintiff and rejected his declarations offered in behalf of the defendant. The principle is well established, by repeated adjudications, that although a man’s declarations are not evidence <em>for </em>him, they are evidence against him, andhis subsequent vendee must abide those declarations. If the plaintiff had relied alone on the evidence of the gift and delivery of the negro, without resorting on his part to the subsequent declarations of the donor, although competent for him to do so, the declarations of the donor offered by the defendant against the plaintiff ought to have been rejected. But as the plaintiff thought proper to resort to the declarations of the donor to ascertain his intention, that testimony like every other ought to be given entire. We therefore think the court erred in excluding the declarations of the donor offered by the defendant in this case. But in as much as the court did permit the defendant to prove by John W. Ryburn and Montgomery Ryburn, the subsequent declarations of the donor against the plaintiff, in substance the same as that rejected, we think the case should not be reversed for this error. <em>Sims vs. Sanders, </em>1 <em>Harp. R. </em>374. 1 <em>Bailey’s R. </em>113, 116.</p>
    <p id="b513-5" data-blocks='[["BL_513.5",513,[171,1614,1203,489]]]'>3d. Although the copy of a writ of attachment, the affidavit, attachment bond, the return on the writ showing the levy and judgment, made an exhibit in the deposition of Jenkins, are no evidence of the legality of the proceedings therein contained, or of the validity of the subsequent sale of the negro under them^ yet as facts or circumstances connected with the acts and declarations of the donor and in relation to which they took place, we think was good evidence to prove the negro was given and not loaned, and for this purpose it was competent.</p>
    <p id="b513-6" data-blocks='[["BL_513.6",513,[175,2115,1198,153]],["BL_514.1",514,[226,341,1186,97]]]'>4th. The four instructions asked and given on the part of the plaintiff, we consider substantially the law. The only doubt that can reasonably arise is as to the 4th instruction, the substance <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>of which is, “that the jury might make the highest value proven the measure of damages.” This we take to be the law.</p>
    <p id="b514-5" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[226,454,1195,152]]]'>5th. The first instruction asked and excluded on the part of the defendant is clearly erroneous. An instrument in writing' has never been held necessary to pass the title to negroes.</p>
    <p id="b514-6" data-blocks='[["BL_514.6",514,[225,620,1194,320]]]'>6th. The second instruction asked and excluded on the part of the defendant was also erroneous. For the reason that the title of the lender might be divested in more ways than the “person in possession obtaining credit on the strength of the property,” as for instance, standing by and encouraging the sale of his pro* perty. The court, therefore, correctly excluded it.</p>
    <p id="b514-7" data-blocks='[["BL_514.7",514,[226,953,1189,427]]]'>7th. The 3d instruction asked and excluded on the part of the defendant was likewise erroneous. For the reason that the sale, taken in connection with the admissions and acts of the donor, was evidence of the fact that the negro had been given and not loaned. Otherwise the sale and all the proceedings connected therewith would have been irrelevant and should have been excluded. The instruction, therefore, was not applicable, and therefore properly excluded-</p>
