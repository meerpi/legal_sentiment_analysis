On the 29th of April, 1847, Franklin S. "Warner filed his bill of complaint against John Cockrell, alleging in substance, that on the 27th of December 1845, the latter purchased from him a large stock of cattle and hogs, and for which he executed to him the following instrument of writing : “ On or before the first day of January, 1847, I promise to pay to F. S. Warner, or bearer, thirty-eight bales of cotton, weighing five hundred pounds each, and an average of my crop made on Long Prairie, with ten per cent interest after maturity, for value received. December 27th, 1845. John Cockrell;” that although Cockrell raised, gathered and bailed, on his plantation in Long Prairie, cotton exceeding thirty-eight bales of the above mentioned weight, which had been demanded after the contract matured : yet that he absolutely refused to deliver the cotton or comply with the agreement, and in violation of it shipped nearly all, if not all his cotton to New Orleans, and placed it beyond the reach of Warner, that Cockrell lived in Louisiana, where the bulk of his estate was situated, and which was under paramount liens and incumbrances, that would render any attempt to enforce the agreement in that State fruitless, even if judgment should be obtained; that he then had personal property in Lafayette county, Arkansas, consisting of negroes, cattle and hogs, sufficient to satisfy the demand, but owned no real estate; that he designed removing all his property from Arkansas into Louisiana, as soon as he could do so,conveniently, and before Warner could possibly recover damages for the infraction of the agreement, by means of the ordinary forms of law; that Cockrell, acknowledging the justice of the demand, refused to adjust or pay the same, and intended, before judgment could be obtained, fraudulently to place his property beyond the reach of legal process, and thus defeat the demand, and that from the best information Warner could obtain as to the value <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>of cotton on the 1st of January, 1847, his demand against Cockrell then amounted to 2,337 dollars.</p>
    <p id="b349-5" data-blocks='[["BL_349.5",349,[249,470,1208,419]]]'>The bill prayed that Cockrell might be compelled to perform the agreement specifically, by delivering the thirty-eight- bales of cotton according to the agreement, or make satisfaction for its-non-performance; that an injunction be issued to prevent the removal of his property, and for general relief. The bill was verified by the affidavit of the complainant; an injunction bond given, and a writ of injunction issued according to the prayer of the bill.</p>
    <p id="b349-6" data-blocks='[["BL_349.6",349,[251,912,1206,1424]],["BL_350.1",350,[168,354,1196,1851]]]'>Cockrell answered, admitting the purchase of cattle and hogs, but denied <em>recollecting </em>that he gave Warner his obligation for thirty-eight bales of cotton, as alleged in the bill, and stated that he gave an obligation for about 1100 dollars and no more; that he gave 1,000 dollars for the cattle and 100 dollars for the hogs; he admitted that he had more than 38 bales of cotton on his plantation, but denied that Warner demanded the cotton, or any thing else, in discharge of the obligation, and averred that after its maturity, Warner gave him <em>his own time </em>to pay it in; he admitted that he had shipped the cotton, as alleged in the bill, as he insisted he had a right to do; he admitted he resided in Louisiana, that some of his property there was under mortgage; but that he had a large amount of property wholly unencumbered, sufficient to pay at least 50,000 dollars, which, at the filing of the bill was subject to execution; he admitted his design of removing-his property from Arkansas to Louisiana, where he resided, but not before January, 1849; denied any intention of avoiding the payment of the sum really due, or of defrauding Warner out of the debt, and denied generally the fraudulent designs and purposes imputed to him in the bill. The answer was verified by the affidavit of Cockrell, and he made it a <em>cross bill </em>against Warner, propounding interrogatories to be answered, and charging that Warner represented that he had at least 270 head of cattle, and they would probably exceed 300, and that he had exceeding 100 hogs, and confiding in this representation he, Cockrell, made the purchase, but that upon collecting them he found that Warner <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>bad only about 130 head of cattle, and 70 head of hogs; he averred that he had no recollection of giving any such obligation as that alleged in the bill, and made other statements and charges, not material to be noticed; he prayed that Warner might be compelled to fully and directly answer the charges and declarations in his answer, as well as the special interrogatories propounded, ■and that an account be had and taken between them, and that Cockrell should be allowed credit for the deficiency in the cattle and hogs, and for general relief. Warner answered the <em>cross bill, </em>denying its charges and allegations, and the imputed misrepresentation, and in response to the interrogatories, set out the circumstances of the contract, and its breach; that Cockrell really obtained a greater number of cattle and hogs than Warner represented he had, that Cockrell had frequently expressed himself perfectly satisfied with his bargain, and that he well knew that the obligation he had executed was for thirty-eight bales of cotton, and not for money at all; that he was not entitled to any deduction or abatement; that Warner had demanded the cotton ■and required compliance with the agreement, on the part of Cockrell, and had not extended the time of payment, as alleged. This answer was verified by the affidavit of Warner. On the :8th of November, 1848, Warner filed his supplemental bill, setting out all the previous pleadings and proceedings, and stating as <em>new matter, </em>that since the last term of the court he had received information confirmatory of the charge in the original bill, as to the removal of the property of Cockrell from Arkansas, and ■that Warner would lose his demand unless the same should be prevented. A fresh injunction was granted, and several slaves belonging to Cockrell seized by the sheriff, but restored to him ■on bond and security, to abide the decree of the court, and pay any sum that might be decreed against him in the case. A subpoena in chancery was issued on the supplemental bill, and executed on Cockrell personally, the 22d of November, 1848; but he failed to answer.</p>

The number secured by Cockrell however, would be no evidence of the number-purchased by him, because he might not have been vigilant ip securing or taking them, or used but little if any care in the bun siness, or performed it in an improper manner. This could not be the criterion. But were it otherwise, the result would be the same, because it is in proof that Cockrell was acquainted with the number and quality of the cattle and hogs, and it cannot be seriously questioned, but that he took upon himself the entire risk of obtaining the fruits of his purchase. If he was negligent or inattentive to them, suffered them to go wild for want of proper care, or could pot, or did not collect them all, the loss was his <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>own and he could claim nothing by way of recoupment at the hands of Warner. The stock was at large — in the range, and it is manifest from the circumstances, that it was what is frequently called a “chancing bargain,” without warranty, and which, in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation, could not entitle the vendor to additional compensation for excess, nor the vendee to any abatement for deficiency. In point of fact however, we are not inclined to believe it was a losing bargain on the part of Cockrell.</p>

On the proof the court fixed the market value at ten cents, and might, with propriety have given as high as eleven cents per pound, on the principle that, where a party has it in his power to discharge himself from <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>liability by the delivery of property, and fails without a sufficient excuse, the damages should be measured by the highest market value of the property at the time when it should have been delivered, 1 Strange, 505. 3 Cowen, 83. <em>Sedgwick on Damages, </em>497. On this ground then, Cockrell has no right to complain. The decree is certainly warranted by the pleadings and evidence, and without specially noticing the items of recoupment claimed by Cockrell, it is sufficient 1o observe that he has suffered no injury, of which he can complain, since if every one of them had been allowed, the decree might still be for the amount for which it was rendered.

It is opposed to that fair dealing, which courts of equity demand at the hands of its suitors. After taking all the chances of a protracted litigation, contesting a cause on the merits, and being at last defeated, to allow him to bring forward that preliminary objection at the hearing bears too close an analogy to taking advantage of one’s own wrong to be encouraged, <em>Ludlow vs. Simond, </em>2 <em>Caines Cas.

Recurring to the answer of Cockrell, it will be perceived that it is not at all calculated to inspire confidence in his statements. He denied recollecting giving an obligation for cotton. That he did give it was amply established, not only by his own acknowledgments, but by due proof of the execution of the instrument itself. He did not absolutely deny giving the obligation, but took shelter behind his recollection, and to say the least of it, his memory must have been exceedingly treacherous. He denied the <em>present </em>intention to remove his property beyond the jurisdiction of the court, yet admitted that he intended to do so at a future time. Although he had received full consideration from Warner, yet, with his $50,-000 of unencumbered property in Louisiana, subject to execution, he never offered to pay any thing, either in money or property, but was manifestly endeavoring to avoid it. The answer was evasive and unsatisfactory, and not calculated to weaken the imputations of fraud, as made in the bill and supplemental bill. The latter he entirely failed to answer, although personally notified in due form of law. Mere non-payment of a debt can never be evidence of a design to defraud, but there were circumstances <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>attending this refusal, which gave a different hue to the transaction. Putting all the circumstances together, we think it may be safely assumed that a fraudulent design existed on his part to prevent the recovery of a just debt.</p>
    <p id="b356-5" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[181,571,1195,1413]]]'>The jurisdiction of a court of equity, incases of actual or constructive fraud, is too well established to be questioned on the one hand, or vindicated on the other; and as this case partakes of that character, we hold that the court had jurisdiction over the subject matter, and was competent to grant relief. And hence, the party having answered and put himself on the merits, without reserving any objection to the jurisdiction, cannot be permitted to derive any advantage from it in this forum, and under these circumstances. But were it otherwise, the jurisdiction is, in our opinion, maintainable upon another ground, to which we will now advert. The answer of Cockrell was made a <em>cross bill </em>against Warner, and interrogatories propounded, <em>(Digest </em>230), and an accounting and general relief prayed for, based on an alleged misrepresentation on the part of Warner, as to the number of cattle and hogs sold; and also on a claim to abatement for deficiency, and on a mistake in the agreement. These grounds too, were connected with the necessity of obtaining a discovery from Warner, and surely it cannot be pretended that they do not lay a sufficient foundation for equity jurisdiction. Since the case of <em>Wheat vs. Dotson, </em>(7 <em>Eng. </em>699), partial failure of consideration is cognizable at law in our courts, but because there is a remedy at law it does not destroy or impair the concurrent jurisdiction of a court of equity over the same subject, but such jurisdiction still continues on its old foundations. 1 <em>Story's Eq. </em>64. <em>Hempstead vs. Watkins, </em>1 <em>Eng. </em>358. <em>Sailly vs. Elmore, </em>2 <em>Paige Ch.

In attaining this end it must frequently happen that mere legal demands on the one side or the other, over which separately a- court of equity would have no jurisdiction, have to be passed "on and relief afforded.
