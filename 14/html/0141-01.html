    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[143,458,1202,1864]]]'>The material fact put in issue is property in the defendant, and consequently the replication must sustain the title, not the mere possessory title, but the absolute title. It is true that possession by the plaintiff and a wrongful taking by the defendant will entitle the plaintiff in the first instance to maintain his action, but when, as Baron Gilbert says, <em>(Treatise on the law of Replevin </em>132) the defendant pleads property in himself, he avoids the injustice of the caption, which is the gist of the action, by showing that he had a right to take it. To such plea the plaintiff replies, not merely a possessory title, unless connected with such facts as would show a right of dominion and control, even against him who has the legal title; but he must reply such facts as show title in himself. The case of <em>Rogers vs. </em>Arnold, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wend.%2036" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="12 Wend. 36">12 <em>Wend. Rep. </em>36</a>, is very strongly in point. The action was replevin, for taking mill irons; pleas, non cepit, property in defendants and another; property in themselves as tenants in common with the plaintiff; property in themselves as tenants in common with the plaintiff and another; property in themselves; and property in one of them. When considering the effect of these pleas, the court said “ All these pleas are obviously founded upon the principle applicable to" this action, that the plaintiff, as in trover, must recover upon the strength of his title to, or property in the goods in question.” And again, upon the same question, the court said “ It is a good plea in this action that the property is in the plaintiff and the defendant, or a stranger; and where there are two plaintiffs, it is in one of them. Here it is shown to be in the plaintiff and one of the defendants, which disproves the issues in the case, that the plaintiff is the exclusive owner. It is not material that the defendant should prove title to the property, as set forth in any one plea, as that is only inducement to the-traverse of the plaintiff’s title, as has been before shown, and need not be, and was not denied in the replication. Upon the issue the plaintiff was bound to prove and maintain an exclusive right to the possession and control of the property.”</p>
    <p id="b145-3" data-blocks='[["BL_145.4",145,[220,357,1197,919]]]'>
      <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>This decision is well sustained by numerous authorities, and from the principle laid down it follows, that as the plaintiff, under such issue, is bound to prove an exclusive right to possession and control, which can only exist where he has the absolute title and exclusive title to the property, or holds under one who has such title, he must, when he replies to such plea, set up matter which, if proven, would uphold and sustain his right to an exclusive right of possession and control of the property. This, we think, the replications fail to do. They neither assert an exclusive right of possession in the plaintiff, nor in one under whom he held possession, but assert a joint property in the slave as heir of certain individuals, and under the will of one of them as legatee, and that they had possession, with the assent of the executor of the will of one of the two, under whom plaintiff and defendants set up title. This clearly gave no right to an exclusive possession, because it only showed a joint tenancy, or a tenancy in common with others.</p>

To the reading of this paper the plaintiff objected, and thereupon the defendant, as a foundation for reading said paper writing in evidence, and against the objection of the plaintiff, produced a pamphlet entitled “ Acts passed at the first session of the 14th Legislature of the State of Louisiana, begun and held in the city of New Orleans, January 7th, 3 839.” And for the same purpose, against the objection of the plaintiff, produced a book with a title page, as follows : “Civil Code of the State of Louisiana, with annotations by Wheelock S. Upton, L. L. D., and Neil R. Jennings. By authority. New Orleans. E. Johnson &amp; Co. Stationers’Hall, 1838.” Upon the production of this act and civil code, or that which purported to be the Civil Code of Louisiana, and under authority of the contents thereof, the court overruled the objection, both to the reading of the pamphlet acts and the civil code, and also to the admissibility of the <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>paper purporting to be a copy of the record of said Parish court, and permitted the same to be read to the jury as evidence.</p>

But then it cannot be said to be authority for making the paper offered in evidence matter of record; because the act is prospective, and was passed some fifteen years or more after the date and record entry of the paper offered in evidence. Nor can the pamphlet offered as the civil code come in aid of this act; because it did not purport to be a statute book of the State of Louisiana, printed under the authority of that State, nor did it appear to have been adopted by any act of the Legislature of the State as a code of laws of the State. The act touching this civil code only authorized the Governor to purchase, for the use of the State, one thousand copies of a new edition of the civil code of Louisiana, proposed to be published by E. Johns &amp; Go., provided that the Governor should be satisfied with the manner in which the Work should be done, and further, that said edition shall be carefully collated with the original manuscript, &amp;c. Now there is no evidence whatever, that the pamphlet offered was one of Johns &amp; Go’s», new edition of the civil code, or that it ever was examined, compared, or approved by the Governor, or that he was satisfied with the manner in which it was done. And even if all this had appeared, there is no provision in the act for adopting this as part of'the code of laws of the State of Louisiana, or of the laws heretofore existing. It simply provides for the purchase of a thousand copies for the use of the State.
