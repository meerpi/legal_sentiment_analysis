    <p id="b422-5" data-blocks='[["BL_422.5",422,[131,580,1208,758]]]'>It is manifest that if she takes the slaves, absolutely and in her own right, she takes the real estate in the same way, and this would be in conflict with the policy of our statute of descents, of preserving the inheritance in the blood of the first purchaser, subject to dower in the common law sense of that term; as to the duration of the estate. It is only when there are no kindred, either paternal or maternal, capable of inheriting, and next before it escheats, that real estate descends from the husband to the wife, or <em>vice </em>versa, <em>(Dig. ch. </em>56, <em>sec. 7). </em>It would be easy to show, by enlarging upon this view of the subject, that if the widow could take one-half of the land absolutely, and not a doWer -estate in it for life only, the Legislature had really achieved much less than half they evidently designed by the system of descents fthey set on foot.</p>
