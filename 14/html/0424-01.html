The plaintiff having the right to sue out an alias, the case was not out of court by the quashal of the writ; and unless she would elect to proceed no further, but resting upon her exception, suffer a judgment dismissing the suit, the decision quashing the writ is merely interlocutory.</p>

At the return term, upon the motion of Yaughan, these writs were quashed upon the ground, that a single writ, and not separate writs, should have issued. But no further judgment appears to have been rendered.</p>
    <p id="b425-5" data-blocks='[["BL_425.5",425,[192,631,1202,432]]]'>The State has brought this case before us on appeal; but there is evidently no final j udgment of the Circuit Court, from which an appeal might be taken to this court. If the State had desired to test the correctness of the-decision of the Circuit Court, she should have refused to proceed further, and suffered final judgment to bo rendered, disposing of the whole case. The question is one of practice, and we. think, properly decided by the court below, and is sustained by <em>State Bank vs. Terry et al. </em><a href="/citations/?q=13%20Ark.%20390" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 Ark. 390">13 <em>Ark. </em>390</a>.</p>
