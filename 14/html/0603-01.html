In 1808 Asa Grant died in North Carolina, leaving a will, one clause of which is in these words, “ I further give unto my beloved wife, (Jemmima), one negro woman, known by the name of Harriett,- and her issue, during her natural life, and after her death the said negro woman Harriet and her issue, I give and bequeath-unto my beloved daughters, Clarissa Grant and Polly Grant, to be equally divided amongst them.” Jemmima Grant, the widow,. <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>married Arthur Morrow;, and they moved to Tennessee, and from thence to Arks ansas, where she died in the year 1848. Clarissa Grant married Eli Cox, in Tennessee, where they continue to live! Polly Grant married Hiram Williams and they moved to Texas, where she died in the year 1845, leaving several children, the issue of their marriage, who are still living. In 1849 Williams sold and conveyed all his right, title and interest in the slaves in controversy to Pack and Cates, two 'of the appellants. From the time of his marriage with Jemmima Grant, Morrow always had possession of Harriet and her; issue, in right of his wife, and after her death, in 1848, he continued to keep them in possession, never until then claiming them as his own. The negroes now in controversy pre Delia, who is the daughter of Harriet, and George the child of Delia.</p>

The action of replevin in the detinet, as <em>now </em>regulated <em>by </em>statute, is very similar to detinue, and may be said to lie in all cases where the plaintiff has the right of property, either general or special, and the right to immediate possession of a chattel taken or detained by the defendant, and differs from detinue in this; that in replevin the plaintiff obtains possession of the chattel in advance of the trial, and the defendant is supposed to be protected from the harshness of the remedy by the affidavit and bond of the plaintiff, and the short period of limitation prescribed for it! The plea of non-detinet (Digest, Title, Replevin, <em>sec. </em>34), puts in issue, not only the wrongful detention of the chattel, but the property of the plaintiff therein, and the special traverse pleaded here had no other effect than to tender a distinct and formal issue of the plaintiffs’ property, general or special, and right to possession at the time of suit brought. The action may be maintained, not only for the breach of a contract of bailment, <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>but the allegation of bailment is fictitious and not traversable; so that replevin in the detinet extends to all cases where the property of one man is wrongfully in the possession of another, though that possession may have been, in its inception, both peaceable and lawful; as in the case of a bailment determinable by demand. It results from the nature of the action, which is to recover possession of a specific chattel, that if there be several part owners of it, they ought all to be joined as plaintiffs in the suit, and the non-joinder or misjoinder of parties in interest, who ought to be plaintiffs, is available in bar as well as in abatement. Although classed among actions <em>ex delicto, </em>and in theory the remedy for a tortious taking, replevin in the detinet differs essentially from actions <em>ex delicto, </em>where, for the injury, loss or destruction of personal property, owned by two or more persons in common, each part owner might consistently recover several damages, which would be commensurate with his interest in the chattel, though the chattel itself be not susceptible of division.

Even if the periods of its adoption could be ascertained, and a distinction taken between the common and statute law of England, we must know, as matter of legal history, that in every American State many of its leading features have been abrogated or changed by legislation, or essentially modified by local common law or usage. Of so much of the common law, as has been expressly adopted, or is tacitly recognized, the reported decisions of the courts in England ought to be regarded as its expositors.

In 1816 the Territorial Legislature of Missouri, formally adopted and declared in force the common law of England of a general nature and all statutes of the British Parliament in aid of, or to supply the defects of the common law, made prior to the fourth year of James the first and of a general nature, and not local to that kingdom, and which common law and statutes were not contrary to the laws of that territory, and not repugnant to, nor inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the United States, as the rule of decision in that territory, until altered or repealed by the Legislature: and that statutory adoption has ever since continued to be in force under the territorial and State governments in Arkansas. Having thus introdnced the common law, without indeed the benefit of any of the judicious statutory reforms in England since the fourth year of James the first, when we administer that law, or what is left of it consistent with our own codifications, we do so, not because it is the law of England, but because it is part of our own law. It is therefore the law of the forum, to which they have submitted, that, in the absence of proof or admission of any other, is to determine the rights of the parties, no matter where the transactions occurred out of which those rights may spring. If the contract, for a breach of which suit is brought here, was made, or to be performed in another State, the law of that State, unless shown to be different, is presumed to be the same as our own. So that if either plaintiff or defendant, asserting or resisting a demand by suit, claimed that the law, peculiar to another State and applicable to the case, arising upon the facts proven, is different from that of the forum, he can only obtain the benefit of the foreign law, by making it a part 'of the case in evidence,</p>

But neither the statute <em>of 22 </em>Chas. 2, requiring administrators to make distribution; nor that of 29th of Chas. 2, exempting the husband, administering in right of his being such, from the duty of making distribution, and thus recognizing his legal right to'retain the surplus, ever had any force or operation in this State.

The Revised Statutes succeeding the Territorial law, re-enacted so much of it, Title, Administration, <em>sec. </em>6, as required letters to be “granted to the representatives of the intestate who <em>may </em>apply for the same and are qualified, preferring first, the husband, or wife,.or one of the persons entitled by law to a distribution of t]ie intestate’s estate,” and though the language there used, would seem as if intended to apply to a state of Case, where by law the husband or wife surviving would succeed, as distributee, to the whole, or some part of the estate of the other, yet the statute of Descents and Distributions, as re-modelled by the revisors, negatives any such <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>apparent intention. The first section of that chapter provides, that “when any person shall die having title to any real estate of inheritance or personal estate, not disposed of nor otherwise limited by marriage settlement, and shall die intestate as to such estate, it shall descend and be distributed in parceny to his kindred, male and female, subject to the payment of debts and the widow’s dower, in the following manner; first to children or their descendants in equal parts,” &amp;c. In addition to that section, which would impose upon every administrator the duty of making distribution in accordance with it, because no exception is any where made in favor of the husband, the 7th section excludes all right of his by providing, that in the event of there being no children or their descendants, or any paternal or maternal kindred capable of inheriting, the whole estate shall go to the wife or husband of the intestate, and if there be no husband or wife, then to escheat. Though an examination at large of this subject, and especially as connected with a more recent enactment of December 8th, 1846, enabling married women to become seized or possessed of property, real or personal, in their own right, while the former law, denying to them the general power of testamentary disposition, is retained in force, would disclose much of lamentable uncertainty and inconsistency, we have no discretion to construe away what appears to be the necessary result of the statute, whether so intended or not, 1 <em>Swift Digest </em>28. <em>Reeves Dom.

The argument is, that the negroes were not choses in action, but property, the possession of which is always presumed to be with the title; that the possession of Morrow, in right of his wife and during the continuance of her life estate, was not adverse but consistent with the title of .those in remainder, and consequently, his possession was their possession, in like manner as if he had been a mere bailee.</p>

By the marriage he becomes liable for her debts previously contracted, but such liability ceases upon the dissolution of the marriage by her death, if not before that time enforced by suit against him. The creditors of the wife would then be without remedy, unless they can resort to the separate property of the wife, or her chattels, or choses in action, not reduced to possession by the husband during coverture. According to the law in England and many of the United States, the husband surviving is entitled to all such property of the wife, which he is entitled to recover as her administrator, thus affording a fund for the payment of the debts of the wife whilst sole, and he retains the residue absolutely, succeeding to <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>it in the character of husband. The’ husband during coverture, may sell or transfer by assignment, legal or equitable, for a valuable consideration, his wife’s choses in action, her chattels not reduced to possession, or, in more general terms, all her right to the present or future enjoyment of them; but if he die without making such disposition, the title to them has not been changed and they survive to the wife in preference to the administrator of the husband. So that the marriage does not operate transfer to the husband as an absolute gift, all the property to which the wife may be entitled, but only the power, by virtue of her right of property, of recovering or reducing it to his possession during the coverture; though indeed there may be a variety of vexed questions in practice, not affecting the theory, concerning what acts of the husband will constitute a reduction to possession. The later decisions in England not only hold that as against the wife surviving, the husband must have exercised his power of alienation during the coverture, but they go to the extent of making the validity of the husband’s alienation contingent upon a reduction to possession by the assignee during the coverture, not only in respect of sales of reversionary interests of the wife, which might not fall in, but of all choses in action, though at the time of assignment susceptible of being immediately reduced into possession; proceeding upon the ground that such being the extent of the husband’s power, his sale or assignment passes no greater authority than he himself had. If that apparent change in the common law is induced by a desire to enlarge the equitable claim of the wife to a settlement or possession for her support, similar to that policy which has prompted the recent statutes in this country, allowing the wife to take and hold a separate property, it may be defective because its benefits are precarious; but it has the merit of enabling a court to afford, in harmony with the common law, an adequate provision for the wife where she needs it, and without any of the jealousies and heart-burnings attending a separation of interests while the married relation subsists. But without reference to what may be termed a new feature in the law, it does seem that, upon old and established <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>principles applicable to the present case, the husband, Williams, did not acquire any absolute property in the slaves in controversy. The two daughters had a vested remainder, which gave them a fixed right of future enjoyment, but the beneficial use of the slaves was in the mother during her life.’ The right of possession was with the temporary use, which Williams could not lawfully disturb, and as his wife died before the determination of the life estate, it was not possible that he, or any assignee of his could have reduced it to possession during coverture. At her death, without any previous disposition of them by him, his power to sell her choses in action, or rights of property in expectancy ceased, equally with his own right to recover them! It is true, those entitled in remainder to a specific chattel have an interest in preserving it, and may by injunction prevent its removal, or restrain those having the temporary use, from acts tending to injure or deteriorate it, and not necessary to a reasonable or judicious enjoyment. If destroyed they might have a remedy in trespass for damages, equivalent to the value of their interest in remainder; but there could be no remedy for those in remainder, inconsistent with the temporary right of possession in the person having the particular estate.</p>

The first case where it appears to have been followed is <em>Pinkard vs. Smith, Littell Sel. cas. </em>336; and there the court say, “Except for the purpose of ascertaining the proper parties to the present contest, it is not however material whether the husband was entitled to the remainder in the slaves, merely as surviving husband, or in virtue of his right to administer on the wife’s estate.” In <em>Bank’s adm’r vs. Marksberry, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Litt.%20281" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="3 Litt. 281">3 Littell </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=3%20Litt.%20281" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="3 Litt. 281">281</a>, the rule was distinctly asserted, though it may have been influenced by a statute of Kentucky there quoted, and the court enter into the same argument used here, to establish a difference between choses in action, which do not vest in the husband unless reduced into possession during the coverture, and his marital rights in the wife’s expectancies in remainder; an argument which implies that the rule sought to be introduced was an innovation, and not a familiar principle of the common law!
