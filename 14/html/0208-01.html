No intendment can be made that demand and notice were in due time, as would be the case if the allegation were general; and did not, as in this case, affirmatively show that the demand and notice were not in due time; and therefore, as no cause of action is shown against Holleville, the defects of the declaration are not cured by the verdict. 1 <em>Ch.

And although a certain day is stated, yet neither in civil nor criminal cases, need the day be proved as laid, but an entirely different day may be proved, and it will be well enough. 1 <em>Chitty's Pl. </em>288, 289. 1 <em>Chitty's Cr.

No exceptions were taken during the trial, nor was any motion made for a new trial, or in arrest of judgment. It stands on error, and consequently if the declaration discloses a cause of action the judgment must be affirmed.

The imperfections in it are precisely of that character which a verdict was intended, under the rule above laid down, to cure. And it is the more essential that it should be so, because, independent of the general presumption of correctness which attaches to judgments of inferior courts until the contrary is made to appear, we may well suppose that on the trial, such facts were proved as established the liability of the plaintiff in error, holding it clear that this might have been done under the declaration, and on the issue that was formed.</p>
