    <p id="b177-5" data-blocks='[["BL_177.5",177,[225,806,1200,765]]]'>We think the breach was well assigned in the second count, as we have substantially set it out. And under the received rule in this country, that the recitals in a deed are <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the payment of the purchase money, the same presumption of like payment arises from the face of this bond with collateral condition. And as there was no mutual or concurrent covenant, making it the duty of the plaintiff to do any other thing, besides making a reasonable demand for the conveyance, as a pre-requisite for his action, we think the demurrer was properly overruled. But before rendering a final judgment the court ought to have caused the plaintiff’s damages to be assessed under the provisions of the statute, in accordance with the previous decisions of this court, and for this error the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded to be proceeded with in this wise.</p>
