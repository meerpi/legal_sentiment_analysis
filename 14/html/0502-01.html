Western, in bad order, a good deal of it was delivered in bulk and had to be rebaled, 28 bales were picked, the expense of which was $64 87, 23 bales were remade, the charge for ■ which was-$112.

    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[175,592,1202,644]]]'>Now if the other evidence, exclusive of this, were sufficient, upon which this verdict might well be sustained, although the court below manifestly erred in permitting this letter to be read as evidence to the jury, yet for this alone the verdict ought not to be disturbed. But aside from this letter, there is no evidence upon which so large an amount of damages, as contained in this-verdict, could be based or sustained: The jury, therefore, must have depended in a great measure upon this evidence in rendering this verdict. Dick &amp; Hill were competent witnesses. Their evidence, if desired by the plaintiff below, ought to have been obtained legally, affording the defendant an opportunity to cross examine them.</p>

D. 1843, and alleged “that he entered on the duties of hi.s said employment as overseer” on that day, is bound by that period, and cannot prove any injury he sustained anterior to that time. For the reason, that this action would be no bar to an action for injury sustained during a term of service anterior to this; because it could not judicially appear that any damages had been recovered for any such anterior term of service; and the declaration itself specifying the commencement of the term of service, would repel any presumption to the contrary.</p>

Now in trespass, with an allegation of a <em>continuando </em>or <em>diversis diebus, </em>if the plaintiff insists upon proving repeated acts of trespass, he will not be allowed to give evidence thereof, unless committed <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>within the time specified.” 1 <em>Ch.
