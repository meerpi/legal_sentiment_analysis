In consideration of which and one dollar, on the day last aforesaid, the said Frederick, by deed in fee simple, conveyed to the said John Baptiste, two lots of land in the village of Arkansas.

Bellette (alias Enselma) rendered me services 25 years, and by his care, economy and continued assiduity to protect my interests, has been an additional hand to help me in accumulating and saving some property. And in consequence a remuneration from me to him, is only just and equitable, and without any cause whatever prejudicial to my children, I am willing, and by these presents, do will that my said father-in-law be independent in his old age from the caprice of my said children, and for these reasons alone, (not including many others of some weight) and in case I die before him, as God and Providence best knows, I wish and intend, that he shall take out of my estate, before any dividend be made by my children, or their representatives, the sum of three thousand dollars, in lawful money, or the equivalent in property at a fair valuation, at his option; and I absolutely will and order that my heirs, executors, or administrators shall truly and honestly execute this act, as a legitimate compensation due to the said J.

He did, however, pay taxes on them in his own name. The families (Notrebe and Bellette’s) lived pretty much as one family, though occupying different buildings. Notrebe furnished provisions for both. Bellette died in possession of the slaves in 1838. After his death Mrs. Bellette occupied a room in the same house with Notrebe as a member of his family. In 1843 or 1844 Notrebe denied Mrs. Bellette’s right to the property. In 1843 he made his will, the tenth article of which is as follows: “Having already given as a gift by a deed, and a bill of sale under date of July the 17th, 1835, some property and slaves to the late John B. Bellette, (alias Enselma) my father-in-law, which has not been expended by him in his lifetime, the same property is to be revertible as a life estate to his widow, Elizabeth Bellette, my mother-in-law, and having also secured to the said late John B. Bellette deceased, by an instrument of writing, under date July 17th, 1835, a sum of three thousand dollars in property, at fair valuation, to be received from my estate after my decease, if in need of it, now the same clause is also in favor of, and revertible to the said Elizabeth Bellette, my mother-in-law, and my absolute will and desire are, that this promise be effected after my decease, if she is in want, and to be fulfilled to the last point. And I recommend my beloved wife, and my two heirs, John and Mary, to continue to cherish her in her old age, and to treat her well in procuring my mother-in-law as good a maintainance as circumstances will enable my wife and two heirs, John and Mary, for their good old mother and grandmother.”</p>

It is true that these several instruments werebetween the same parties, and were evidently intended for atwo-fold common purpose: to provide means for the present comfort and independent support of an aged relative, and also, in case of contingency to provide for further support after the death of the obligor or donor. The present wants of Mr. Bellette were supplied by an absolute deed for a house, and slaves to wait upon and work for him. The first two instruments, absolute and unconditional, effected this; and although there is manifested throughout a praiseworthy solicitude on the part of Mr. Notrebe to provide for his father-in-law, above all care for remuneration, still it is expressly admitted by him, and we must so consider it, that these instruments were made upon a full and valuable consideration. They are neither gifts nor legacies, but deeds of sale upon valuable consideration, not to take effect at a future day, but instantly, and which, in this instance, was followed up by the actual possession and enjoyment of <em>the </em>property. Mr. Notrebe admitted the property to be Mr. Billette’s until after his death, and after that time, as we shall presently see, he might well have asserted claim to the property. The third instrument, it is true, relates to the same subject matter, and although that too, is acknowledged to be upon full consideration, and only what is due, it is made to depend upon two contingencies; first, the death of Mr.- Notrebe, and secondly, the pecuniary circumstances of Mr. Bellette. Admitting the testamentary character of this instrument in several leading particulars, we are not of opinion it <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>can draw to it the other two instruments and defeat their obvious intent and legal effect.</p>

By the force and effect of each of them, a perfect title vested in Mr. Bellette, which no subsequent act of Mr. Notrebe could defeat. If the effect of the third instrument, as contended for, is to constitute these three instruments one, and to make them all testamentary, then Mr. Notrebe would have had an unquestionable right to revoke them at pleasure during his life. But surely it cannot be contended that a bill of sale vesting an absolute title in slaves, upon full and valuable consideration could, after its execution, be revoked; and yet such must be the consequence, if the argument of counsel be correct. The very nature of these instruments forbids that they should be considered testamentary. In the case of <em>Habergham vs. </em>Vincent, 2 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>204, the deed was executed after the will, made in reference to it, and could only exist in it: whatever title passed was in reference to the will. Here the bill of sale was at the same date, upon full consideration, and could well exist and take effect without reference to the third instrument. We are satisfied that the slaves passed to Mr. Bellette, and were held by him as his absolute property, and at his death, became the property of Mr. Notrebe, by virtue of his marriage with the daughter and sole heir of Mr. Bellette, subject to the dower interest of his wife, Mrs. Elizabeth Bellette. At the death of Mr. Notrebe, under the provisions of the tenth article of his will, Mr. Bellette acquired a life estate in the slaves. Of course, as Mr. Notrebe held them subject to her dower interest, he could only convey by will such interest as he had, which when taken in <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>connection with her dower interest vested in her an absolute estate for life.</p>

    <p id="b156-6" data-blocks='[["BL_156.6",156,[197,694,1192,153]]]'>This being our conclusion, it follows, that Mrs. Notrebe has no present interest or estate in the slaves and was improperly made a party plaintiff in the suit.</p>

We should think not; at least until the debts are paid, or time allow'ed for paying them, because she takes her title under the will, subject to the payment of debts, and the estate passes into the hands of the executor in the first place to satisfy debts. Upon this point we have been referred to several authorities, which we think quite satisfactory. <em>Andrews vs. Hunneman. </em><a href="/citations/?q=6%20Pick.%20129" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="6 Pick. 129">6 <em>Pick.

The right of the legatee to his legacy is suspended, until by the assent of the executor or the lapse of time, for the settlement of the estate, this suspension is removed. Thus in Mississippi, where A. bequeathed a slave to B., which was in B’s possession at the testator’s death, it was held that the executor might recover hire for the period of one year after the grant of letters testamentary, he having until that time to examine into and settle the estate. <em>King vs. Cooper, Walker's Miss.

They both lived together; the slaves had been up to the death of Mr. Bellette, in his possession, and after his death became <em>by </em>operation of <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>law, the joint property of Mr. Notrebe as heir, in right of his wife, and of Mrs. Bellette as the widow entitled to dower. If, after the death of Mr. Notrebe, she retained and possesed herself of the slaves, and the estate of Mr. Notrebe was clearly sufficient to pay his debts without drawing upon specific legacies, then slight circumstances might be sufficient from which to infer assent; such as continued acquiescence by the executor in her possession, after time had been allowed to examine into the condition of the estate. How this was, the facts as agreed upon do not show.</p>
