It appears from the transcript sent up, in connection with what has been since certified into this court in obedience to its process, that on the 17th day of May, 1834, Nathaniel Cox, in accordance with the Territorial statute of that day, filed his petition in the Independence Circuit Court against James Boswell, administrator of I-Iartvvell Boswell, deceased, Frances Ann Boswell, his widow, and Elvira D. Boswell, a minor, their only child, to foreclose a mortgage on certain lands. He set out a copy of the mortgage in the petition, admitted that the administrator had paid the sum of $592 34, on the 16th day of April, 1833, and $1,000 on the 19thMaróh, 1834, on the mortgage debt, and prayed for a foreclosure for the residue of the original, debt of five thousand.dollars. At the November term 1834, Fowler, having in the meantime married the minor daughter, appeared and was made a defendant also, and the cause was continued by consent. In the May term 1835, the administrator and the widow severally answered that they believed the allegations of the petition to be true, but knew nothing of their own knowledge. The administrator set up the two partial payments mentioned in the petition, and the widow her claim of dower in the mortgaged lands, and the cause was continued by consent. From this time until the Decemberterm 1841 inclusive, the cause was'regularly continued. On the 24th day of Aug., 1842, in vacation, James Lawson, jr., filed a sworn suggestion of the death of Cox, and grant of letters testamentary upon his estate to him by the Probate Court of Pulaski county, of the death of Frances Ann, the widow, and of the death of James Boswell, administrator of Hartwell, and of the grant of administration <em>de bonis non, </em>on the estate of the latter to Absalom Fowler, and caused a subpoena in the nature of a <em>scire facias </em>to be issued against Fowler and his wife, to show cause why the cause should not progress in the name of Lawson, administrator of Cox,.</p>

From this time until the May term 1848, Lawson, at each term made various efforts to progress with the cause, but was always repulsed, until finally, during that term, to wit: On the 6th June, 1848, he was overthrown, it having been considered by the court, that the suit as to him should abate, that he should pay all costs that had accrued as to him, and be allowed to withdraw his exhibits theretofore filed.</p>

Egner as trustee for Fowler, and against John Ruddell. And thereupon Byers as administrator of Cox filed in court his amended and supplemental bill, and Fowler then, in proper person, appeared and waived process of subpoena, both for himself and as attorney for Egner and Ruddell, and leave of court having been granted to plead, answer, or demur at the next term, the cause was continued.</p>

If this proposition be true, then although the money collected by Fowler may not have been paid over, nevertheless if the aggregate of the five hundred dollars added to such other sums as the evidence may show in his hands, should be equal to the residue of the mortgage debt, the law would presume the mortgage debt fully paid. But the proposition is not true. It is true only of those cases of double capacity where the party cannot sue himself as executor and creditor, or guardian. The more ancient rule of the common law was, that where such a double capacity was created by act of a party creditor, as would suspend an action, the debt or duty would be thereby extinguished. The more modern rule, instead of extin<a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>guishing the debt or duty, allows it to be satisfied by way of retainer. It was from this source that the law of retainer sprung. In cases where retainer was allowed, because otherwise there would be no remedy, as in cases where a party was both trustee and administrator of adverse rights, or executor and guardian, the law works a transmutation by its own force, and always presumes that a party having a double capacity, takes and holds in that capacity in which of right he ought to take and hold, and as to third persons, holds him bound to do so. In cases, however, where a party has another remedy besides that of retainer, there is no ground upon which to presume that he elects to retain until he manifests an intention to do so by some overt act, some affirmative action. And even in cases where there was no other remedy than by retainer, affirmative action has been held necessary in some cases, but the better opinion is as we have stated it. The double capacity of administrator and agent for a creditor of the estate, is certainly not one of the former class, and if in such case, the legal right of retainer exists at all, which to say the least, is doubtful, a party claiming its benefit, would have to show that an election to retain had been made.</p>

On the contrary, it may be safely said that, as mere declarations, they are never competent, because what one man says, not upon oath, cannot be evidence against another man, who was absent and had no opportunity, by any question or observation to set it right if incorrectly said.</p>

And hence, there maybe many material facts interesting to either party resting in the knowledge of the agent, which like any other facts may be proven by evidence, and not by the proof of mere assertions, or representation of those facts; and therefore, if sought to be established by the agent, must be established by his evidence under oath, and not by proving what he might have said about them, against one who was absent when he said it.</p>

Ev. sec. </em>113.) The act and the words together, as an entirety, make the whole thing to be proved — the ultimate fact, <em>(4th Wend.

Ilence, all words of an agent which accompany his authoritative act, and tend to determine its quality, are always binding on the principal because he is bound by the act, and must be bound by the words which show its quality, and are therefore a part of it, though verbal. It was upon this principle that all that was said by an agent at the time of settlement of accounts, was held competent in the case cited from 4 <em>Wend. Rep., </em>whereas, what he said about the settlement seventeen months afterwards, was not allowed to be proven, not because his agency had then expired, but because it was the mere representation or assertion of the agent, which the court say could not have been proven, <em>“ </em>if made one hour after the business was closed.”</p>

But on the contrary, they were voluntary statements of Boswell to an indifferent person, made by his own seeking, to unburthen his own mind in the expression of his gratification at the probable near approach of an event that he had long and anxiously desired to occur, and about which he may have been so long and so often baffled, that now when the thought had been begot, whether by sober fact or by the wish, he could not withstand the impulse to communicate it to a friend.</p>

Thompson, an employee of James Boswell, it seems, applied to the latter for money to be used in the business of the latter. In the act of thus attending to his own business, James Boswell exhibits this “peck of silver money” in a drawer by itself, and passes over the desired money out of another drawer. When the witness expressed a wish to have some of the “peck of silver money” Boswell told him he could not have it, as it belonged to Hart-well Boswell’s estate, and he wanted: it for a particular purpose.”' The substantive act in process of being done, about which all the evidence of Thompson relates, was an act of James Boswell in the transaction of his <em>own business, </em>and not any act in the transaction of any business of his brother’s estate: his verbal statements in strictness, but show the quality and become part and parcel of his own act, not any act in his representative capacity. Incidentally, however, to his own act in resisting the application of Thompson for some of the “peck of silver money,” he assumes to perform a duty of his representative character in refusing to use funds, which he says, are in his hands in that character. If this was a <em>bona fide </em>representative act, the words conduced to show its quality and become evidence that the money was indeed the money of the estate, and would be competent as far as it went against the representatives of Cox; but if, on the contrary, it was but a shift to evade the application of Thompson for some of the money, which, it is strongly infei'rable from his deposition, he wanted for his own purposes, and not for the purposes of Boswell, his emplojmr, as he did the money he received out of the other drawer, then the words but showed the quality of Boswell’s act in his own X’ight, and could not be competent evidence as against the representatives of Cox. Under this pex’plexity it is perhaps safer to hold that the woi’ds wei’e competent to show that the money belonged to the estate of Boswell, and let the doubt as to its competency go to its weight. As, however, in either event, James Boswell cannot possibly be supposed from the evidence of Thompson to have assumed any duty of his representative character beyond the mere preservation of the sup<a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>posed funds held in his fiduciary character, in making this answer to Thompson, no words going beyond that duty could be competent as against the representatives of Cox, consequently the words, that “he had a particular use ¡for the money,” could not be competent at all, or if so to any extent, only to that of conducing to prove as part of the act of preserving the funds, that they were funds of the estate, and could not by possibility be competent to prove any appropriation of these funds to the payment of the mortgage debt, for there was no such act of payment assumed to be done primarily or incidentally, for such words to qualify and enter into. The very most that can possibly be made of the whole matter, as shown by Thompson’s deposition is, that primarily, James Boswell was acting in the transaction of his own private business, and that secondarily, he performed the representative duty .of refusing to use the funds of the estate of his intestate for his own private purposes. The fact that he did the latter and that he kept such funds in a separate drawer from his own, is in exact accordance with his duty as administrator, and with the exemplary character and accurate business habits of the man, as shown on the part of the defence; and therefore afford no presumption of the appropriation of the money to the payment of the mortgage debt as would have arisen, had it been shown that he was in the general habit of mixing his private funds with those of the estate, using but one common purse.</p>

And it is not probable that any court of competent jurisdiction would allow an administrator the amount of a payment claimed as having been made to himself, as agent, unless distinctly shown, and until after the most thorough scrutiny, if at all. And so far from the proof of the business habits of James Boswell, and of his habitual free communications with his friends, Ringgold and Egner, affording us aid in malting the desired presumption of payment, even if the links in the testimony, which we have indicated, were not wanting, they tend strongly to the contrary, and we can but feel that they militate against the verity of Thompson’s statements, as to his having seen the “peck of silver money;” which, on the other hand, might be sustained by some circumstances that would allow'of his having seen some few hundred, which his inexperienced eyes might have caused his imagination to magnify. For it can but seem remarkable that, upon the part of the defence, some trace of the outgoings of so much money should not have been shown by the evidence of these witnesses, <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>which is so full and explicit that there was no money on hand at the death of James Boswell. If it had been paid out in Bates-ville, a man of James Boswell’s business habits and free intercourse with Ringgold and Egner, as shown by the testimony, would scarcely havegacted without leaving some trace in the knowledge of these witnesses; nor is the probability less, if he had remitted it by mail, as to some fact connected with the remittance being within their knowledge.</p>
