The magistrate, in his response, admitting that he had rendered such judgment, as set forth in the alternative writ, further stated that afterwards and on'the same day the judgment was rendered, an application was made to him by Walker’s counsel, to set it aside and grant a new trial, because an offset, offered to be filed on the part of Walker, had been improperly ruled out at the trial in question; and he, the respondent, being satisfied that he had erred in rejecting the offset, did set aside and vacate that judgment and grant a new trial, of which new trial the petitioner, Coleman, had notice. That upon a second hearing of the case, a judgment was rendered against Coleman, which stands in full force upon the respondent’s docket as a justice of the peace, unsatisfied and unappealed from; and there being no longer any such judgment as that alleged by the petitioner, the respondent submits whether he can or ought to issue execution upon it.

And it is one of some difficulty; because justices of the peace being judicial officers, it would seem that so much discretion ought to be confided to them, as would enable them to correct their own erroneous judgments, by granting anew trial. But the Legislature has not thought proper to provide for such remedy, and the power cannot be inferred as one inseparable from a court of such inferior and limited jurisdiction. While the General Assembly could not deprive justices of the peace of any part of the jurisdiction given to them by the constitution, or even so legislate as to clog or impair it, or prevent its exercise by omitting to legislate <em>Moore vs. Woodruff, </em><a href="/ark/5/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Ark. 214" data-case-ids="8726900" data-case-paths="/ark/5/0214-01">5 <em>Ark. </em>214</a>, there can be as little doubt that the mode and manner of exercising their jurisdic<a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>tion may be controlled and regulated by law. The various provisions of the statute concerning justices of the peace and regulating the proceedings in suits before them, are so minute and specific, as by intendment to exclude the power of granting new trials in contested cases, to which no allusion is made. A justice of the peace may adjourn causes from day to day until the business qn his docket is disposed of, <em>Digest, Title, </em>Justices of the Pf.ace, <em>sec. </em>11; may adjourn a case, ifhe deems it necessary, not exceeding thirty days, <em>ib. sec. </em>71; may grant continuances for cause shown on the application of either party not exceeding sixty days, <em>ib. sec. </em>75; may set aside a judgment of non-suit or by default, if applied for within fifteen days; <em>ib. sec. </em>89, and then the justice is required to make out and cause to be served, in the same manner as a summons, a notice to the opposite part¿ of the time and place fixed for the new trial, <em>ib. sec. </em>91. Either party aggrieved by the judgment of a justice may appeal within thirty days (except from a judgment of non-suit, or by default, where no application is made within fifteen days to set it aside) to the Circuit Court, where the trial is <em>de novo </em>upon the facts and merits, <em>ib. see. </em>174, <em>et seq., </em>whereby the party aggrieved is relieved from all apprehension of irreparable injury by means of an unjust and erroneous decision, and if the right of appeal be lost without any fault of the party, or is attempted to be taken away by the legislature, the supervising controll of the superior courts may be exercised in some other appropriate mode.</p>

The number of new trials, the causes for which they should be granted, the kind of notice to the opposite party, the <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>time beyond which the magistrate should cease to have contrail over judgments rendered by him, would, as the law now stands, be left to the discretion of a vast number of inferior courts, only quasi courts of record, having no clerk, no seal, no perpetual succession or continuance of office, and without terms of fixed and limited duration.</p>
