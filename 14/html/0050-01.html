To this, the defendants answered, denying the fraud and combination charged; averring that the purchase by Refeld was in all respects fair and not colorable.

    <p id="b53-5" data-blocks='[["BL_53.5",53,[205,473,1203,1260]]]'>The substantial provisions of the statute are, that mortgagees of real or personal estate, may proceed by petition in the Circuit Court, against the mortgagor, and the actual occupiers of any of the real estate, setting out the mortgage, praying that judgment may be rendered for the debt, and that the equity of redemption may be foreclosed, and that the mortgaged property may be sold to satisfy the amount due. All persons claiming an interest in the mortgaged property may be made defendants, and may plead any lawful matter in avoidance of the deed or debt. If upon trial, the mortgage money appears to be unpaid, the court is to render judgment for the debt, interest and costs, and make an order that the specific mortgaged property be sold, or so much as will be sufficient to satisfy the amount due. Upon this judgment or decree, a special writ of <em>fieri facias </em>issues describing the property, and commanding that it be sold to satisfy the mortgage debtso adjudged. The mortgagor has, in all cases, until the day of sale under the execution to redeem the mortgaged premises, by paying the amount due. The judgment or decree, as in other cases, is a general lien from its rendition upon the real estate of the mortgagor. If, upon the return of the special <em>fieri facias, </em>it appears that the mortgaged property failed to produce satisfaction of the debt, an execution may issue for the residue as on ordinary judgments.</p>

    <p id="b53-7" data-blocks='[["BL_53.7",53,[207,2023,1191,325]],["BL_54.1",54,[177,355,1202,702]]]'>The statute does not take away, but its policy is to discourage, in practice, the common law right of the mortgagee to bring his action at law for the debt. Because, if the mortgagee obtains an independent judgment at law, the result might be exceedingly harsh and oppressive, if he be allowed to subject the estate of the debtor to the “sweeping desolation of an execution at law,” without ex<a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>hausting the mortgaged property, which the one had given and the other accepted as security for the debt. So, if the execution be levied on the mortgaged property, the question would arise whether the sale bars the equity of redemption, or whether the purchaser acquires the property discharged from or subject to the-mortgage; either way, the property is sold under the cloud of the subsisting mortgage, and a door is open for the commission of frauds to evade a sacrifice of property. Although the common law doctrine of strict foreclosure is unknown to our law, or never resorted to in practice, yet the effect might be the same if the mortgagee can become the purchaser of the equity of redemption, under his judgment at law for the mortgage debt, and so unite in himself the equitable and the legal estate.</p>

The mortgagor has the benefit of a fair public sale of the mortgaged premises, with assurance to the purchaser of a clear title, all the parties in interest having been before the court. The mortgagee has the benefit of the general lien of his judgment or decree for tbe debt, and, if this be not satisfied by the sale of the mortgaged property, he can at once sue out an ordinary execution for the residue, without being remitted to a court of law, to complete his remedy by obtaining a judgment <em>in personam </em>against the mortgagor for such residue.</p>

We must conclude that the opinion in that case was not well considered. It may be doubted whether the statute contemplates any formal decree of foreclosure, in order to bar the equity of redemption, (see sec. 13,) and if it does, whether the decree for the debt, and for the sale of the property to satisfy it, is not a substantial compliance with the law. This point is much discussed, though without reference to any such statutory provision in the case of <em>Lansing vs. Goelet, </em>9 <em>Cowen </em>347. And if the omission to enter a formal decree of foreclosure be not a compliance with the statute,, it is difficult to see how the mortgagor could complain of it as erroneous. The decision there evidently proceeds on the ground that the statute affords a remedy to be strictly pursued. Our views of the statute are altogether different. It is the only statute regulating the law of mortgages in this State. It is to be' apprehended that many unfortunate consequences would follow, if without such a controling statute, we should have to fall back upon the common law and the statutes of England, prior to the fourth year of James the First, to determine the rights growing, out of such contracts.</p>

True, the mortgagee connot go into chancery, and ask merely for a decree or judgment for his debt. But on the face of this bill and exhibits the court of chancery had jurisdiction to decree foreclosure as well as to render judgment for the debt. Upon the suggestion of the appellant, the adverse rights of a third party were brought before the court, thus calling into exercise one of the peculiar powers of equity jurisdiction. In order to determine that the complainant was not entitled to a decree of foreclosure and sale of the realty as against Refeld, it necessarily took cognizance of the cause and did adjudicate it. A court of chancery having jurisdiction of a cause for one purpose, and having all the parties in interest before it, will do complete justice between them and end litigation by disposing of all the questions in the cause, though any of them separately be of legal cognizance.</p>
