    <p id="b553-6" data-blocks='[["BL_553.8",553,[152,825,1206,1194]]]'>The indictment, preferred at the February term, 1853, of the Hot Spring Circuit Court, charged that the appellants, on the tenth day of March, A. D. 1852, at&amp;c., bet a certain sum of money at an unlawful game at cards called draw pocre, then and there played by them together. Asecond count alleged the game played to be called pocre. On the trial the State proved that, at the August term 1852, an indictment which, leaving out of view any variance between them, the jury were authorized to .infer was for the same offence, was preferred against Jester, Ready, Morehead and one Cyrus A. Hale, charging that the games in question were played by those four persons together, on the tenth day of March, 1852. That Hale, having pleaded guilty to that indictment at the February term, 1853, it was then, on motion of the attorney for the State, quashed as to the other defendants, Jester, Ready and Morehead. The parol testimony on the trial conduced to prove that during the month of January, 1852, in the county of Hot Spring, these defendants had bet money upon a game at cards called pocre, then and there played by them together with Hale and one Joshua F. Morris,, and that the witnesses for the prosecution had so testified before the grand jury, at each term of the court when the respective indictments were found.</p>

The refusal of the court to give this instruction and the omission to charge the jury in any manner equivalent to it, was clearly erroneous, according to the opinions of this court in <em>Drew vs. The State, </em>5 <em>Eng. </em>82. <em>Parrott vs. The State, ib: </em>572. <em>Moffat vs. The State, </em>6 <em>ib. </em>169. <em>Stith vs. The State, </em><a href="/ark/13/0680-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 Ark. 680" data-case-ids="8728438" data-case-paths="/ark/13/0680-01">13 <em>Ark. </em>680</a>, and <em>Johnson vs. The State, ib. </em>684.</p>

The provision of the statute, <em>Digest, Title, </em>Criminal Proceedings, <em>sec. </em>104, is “When any indictment or prosecution shall be quashed, set aside or reversed, the time during which the same was pending, shall not be computed as part of the time of the limitation prescribed for the offence.” As the first indictment could only have been quashed by the decision of the court, the presumption is, that it was done, though on motion of the attorney for the State, for sufficient cause, in the exercise of judicial discretion, and not capriciously, or with any design to harrass the accused, so that, although the quashal might operate as a hardship, we cannot presume they yvere injured by it, because such a proceeding is a .contingency provided for by the statute and liable to occur in the administration of justice.</p>

If the second indictment had charged that these defendants bet at a game played by them together with Hale, the question might have been analogous to <em>The State Bank vs. </em>Gray, and <em>same vs. Roddy, </em>where the cause of action was the same, though all the defendants in the first suit were not embraced in the second.</p>
