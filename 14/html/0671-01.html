The allegation in the declaration, setting out the judgment, is that the plaintiff, on &amp;c., at a superior court, held in the county of Talbot, in the State of Georgia, to wit, &amp;c., by the considera] tion and judgment of said court, recovered against the defend' <a id="p673" href="#p673" data-label="673" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*673</a>ant the sum of one hundred and twenty dollars, for her debt, as also the further sum of twenty-one dollars and thirty-three cents for her damages, which she had sustained by reason of the detention of said debt, together with the further sum of ten dollars and fifty cents for her costs in and about said suit in that behalf expended, whereof the defendant was convict <em>prout patet per </em>re<em>cordura, fyc,. </em>The transcript produced to the court below, upon the issue to the plea of <em>nul tiel </em>record, shows that, in an action of assumpsit, before the superior court of Talbot county, Georgia, the defendant confessed judgment to the plaintiff for the sum of one hundred and twenty dollars, principal, with interest and costs of suit, and the plaintiff’s attorney signed judgment as follows: “Whereupon, it is considered by the court that the plaintiff do recover of the defendant the sum of one hundred and twenty dollars, for its principal debt, and the further sum of twenty-one dollars and thirty-three cents, for its interest, and the further sum of ten dollars and fifty cents, for costs of suit in this behalf expended,” &amp;c. In the authentication of the judgment, the judge, who certifies to the attestation of the clerk, styles himself thus: “I, Alfred Iverson, Judge of the Superior Courts of the Chatahoochee circuit, in said State, in which circuit is said county of Talbot,” dec.

The original recovery, though informal, is, in effect, the same as that described by the pleader in this suit. It is true the cases cited for the plaintiff, among which are, <em>The State Bank vs. </em>Gray, 7 <em>Eng. </em>760. <em>State Bank vs. </em>Magness, 6 <em>ib. </em>343, and <em>The State Bank vs. Sherrill, ib. </em>334, cannot be said to apply, because in those cases, the recital of the record was only inducement to the main fact intended to be established by it, that is, the institution of a former suit upon the same cause of action, to rebut the presumption arising from lapse of time; and the case of <em>Adams vs. The State for the use of Wallace, </em>at July term, 1853, was decided upon a like reason. But here the judgment sued upon <a id="p674" href="#p674" data-label="674" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*674</a>is necessarily the foundation of the action, and it must be conceded that a misdescription of it, in any material matter, would be a fatal variance. Yet in such cases the pleader is not required to describe the recovery <em>in haec </em>verba, or according to its-tenor; but may set it out according to its legal effect. The rate of interest allowed by law, is the measure of damages for the breach of a contract to pay money, and whether the action be in form, assumpsit or debt, the damages, in the shape of interest, follow as a legal consequence upon the ascertainment of the debt. The judgment is correctly described, as to the parties, the' court by whom rendered, its dates and amounts, and the declaration would therefore seem to be a compliance with the reason-for the rule of pleading, that a contract must be accurately described in order to identify the cause of action, for the protection’ of the defendant and as a security against further litigation.</p>
