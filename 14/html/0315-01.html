    <p id="b316-5" data-blocks='[["BL_316.7",316,[196,586,1201,1031]]]'>This was an action of covenant, brought by Williams against Green, upon an article of agreement entered into between them on the 6th of October, 1852, for the sale of a tract of land and improvements: the substance of the agreement, so far as necessary to be here stated, being, that Williams traded and bargained to Green a certain tract of land, containing forty-five acres more or less, the price to be thirty dollars per acre for the land, with the addition of the value of the improvements upon it, such valuation to be made by two persons named in the article, and for which payment was to be made in goods of Green, then in store, consisting of groceries, hardware; &amp;c., at the original cost, with the addition of freight on certain of the articles, and the balance of the payment for the land to be made in good mules at cash valuation. The. agreement concludes as follows : “In wdtness of the above trade we hereby set our hands and seals, and on forfeiture of complying with it on the part of either Green or Williams, we hereby bind ourselves, our heirs, &amp;c., in the sum of five hundred dollars, to be well and truly paid. In testimony whereof, &amp;c.</p>

Therefore, according to what seems to be the intention of the pleader, though somewhat inartificially expressed, the plaintiff cl aims to recover the specified sum of five hundred dollars <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>agreed to be paid by either party, on forfeiture of complying with the trade.</p>

    <p id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.6",317,[270,975,1212,375]]]'>But under the clause of general demurrer, and treating the action as being brought to recover the sum of five hundred dollars as stipulated damages, the question arises upon the construction of the instrument sued on, whether it was the intention of the parties to liquidate the damages consequent upon the failure of either party to comply with the agreement, or whether the clause quoted was designed as a mere penalty.</p>
    <p id="b317-6" data-blocks='[["BL_317.7",317,[279,1363,1198,427]]]'>If there is any branch of the law, sometimes inveighed against for uncertainty, deserving of such a reproach, it is the subject we have here to consider. And though admonished by the caution evinced by other courts of the danger of attempting to lay down any general rule for cases of this description, it seems to be necessary, in order to explain the grounds of our decision, to notice, albeit in a cursory and unsatisfactory manner, the principles which may affect the question to be decided.</p>
    <p id="b317-7" data-blocks='[["BL_317.8",317,[275,1804,1206,542]],["BL_318.1",318,[145,352,1206,1972]],["BL_319.1",319,[257,340,1205,321]]]'>Anciently, at the common law, the penalty named in a bond was a security for the performance of the condition annexed to it. Upon forfeiture of the condition the obligee was entitled to recover the penalty, which was at the same time the utmost limit and beyond which the obligor’s liability could not be extended. To obviate the hardship and injustice often growing out of this stubborn rule, arose one of <em>the </em>early jurisdictions of courts of equity, to relieve against penalties and forfeitures, by decreeing that the judgment for the penal sum should stand as a security for the payment by the obligor of such damages as the obligee <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>had actually sustained, of which an account would be taken. The practical effect of .the English statute, re-enacted or tacitly adopted in this country, requiring the plaintiff suing upon a penal bond to suggest the breaches complained of, and entering a formal judgment for the penalty, to have execution only for the amount of damages assessed, the penalty being in the meantime considered as a security for any further breaches that might occur, was to enable courts of law to administer the same relief before afforded in chancery. There was no substantial difference between this form of the remedy and an action of covenant upon the condition and for some breach of it, disregarding the penalty; and it became reasonably apparent, that if the courts, for the protection of the obligor, looked to the actual damages sustained by the obligee, they should equally disregard the penalty in favor of the obligee, where his damages for a breach of the condition expressing the real contract of the parties, happened to exceed the penalty. While the law was undergoing this change in England, some curious illustrations may be found in the reported cases, of a halting between the old and the new opinion. Sometimes the obligor was allowed to relieve himself from all further liability for damages, by paying into court the amount of the penalty; though an unsubstantial compliance with the contract, as unreal as it would be to compel the obligee in all cases to accept such damages as might be awarded to him, without the right in any case to have a specific performance. Wherever we admit that the enquiry now at law, as in equity, is, what damages the obligee has really sustained by a breach of the condition, it would seem to follow that, as the obligor cannot, in any case, become liable for the penalty disregarding the condition, so he can claim no protection from it. And it would seem to be equally plain, that upon bonds with a condition, an action of covenant may be maintained for damages for a breach of the condition, whenever it contains an express or implied undertaking to do or not to do the particular act. The plaintiff in such case will recover damages commensurate with the injury he has sustained. True, when the obligee brings debt for the pen<a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>alty, assigning breaches for the condition, he may not, owing to the technical form of the remedy, be enabled to recover damages to an amount exceeding the penalty; and upon official bonds, and so far as the rights of securities are to be affected, recoveries against them might not be enforced to an amount exceeding the penalty which is for their protection.</p>
    <p id="b319-5" data-blocks='[["BL_319.5",319,[255,672,1211,1207]]]'>But while courts of equity afford relief against penalties, they will not relieve against liquidated damages. As penalties became unavailing, because the obligee, not entitled to or not seeking a specific performance, was required to accept a compensation in damages for such injury as he could show he had sustained, a new reform of contract was resorted to, whereby the parties anticipated and agreed in advance, for a certain amount of damages which would be accepted as a full compensation for such injury as might be sustained by a breach of the contract. Many cases may be supposed where it would be altogether proper and expedient to allow the damages to be thus stipulated. Prudent men understanding their own affairs, might not be willing to run the risk of a failure of evidence to prove their situation and inducements for entering into the contract, or trace the various sources from whence injury or inconvenience was expected to result. The obligor and obligee, though for opposite reasons, might be equally unwilling to submit the question of uncertain damages to any arbitration or the precarious assessment of a jury. No court has been bold enough to deny to parties capable of contracting the right to make such contracts as they choose to enter into, in any mode authorized by law, provided they be not illegal, immoral, or against public policy.</p>
    <p id="b319-6" data-blocks='[["BL_319.6",319,[264,1891,1203,432]],["BL_320.1",320,[145,356,1206,585]]]'>But contracts for stipulated damages are narrowly watched, because of the facility they may afford of being used as a cover for penalties in disguise. One of the inflexible rules of law on this subject is, that whenever the sum agreed to be paid, though expressed as stipulated damages, is in lieu of the non-payment of a lesser sum, certain or capable of being ascertained from the terms of the contract, it is construed to be a penalty. Besides violating the usury laws, such a contract could not be enforced, <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>as stipulated damages, because it would become a mere subterfuge and evasion of the equitable doctrine of relieving against bonds with a penalty, conditioned for the payment of money. Germain to this is the rule, equally inflexible, that the mortgagor will not be allowed by any shift or device; to cut himself off from the equity of redemption. Though the creditor, where a high standard of commercial integrity prevails, may be ruined by his debtor’s want of punctuality, the law has fixed a certain rate of interest as a compensation for the use of money. This principle distinctly stated in <em>Orr vs. Churchil, </em>1 <em>Hen. Black., </em>pervades all the cases.</p>

We have seen that the insertion of a penalty has become of little or no practical utility, and in this State where specialty debts have no preference over other debts due by simple contract, it could hardly be maintained that a penalty ailords any security whatever: so that the reason fails, for the criterion sometimes laid down, that where the sum agreed to be paid is to secure the performance of some collateral act, it will be construed as a penalty. Yet while the form of bonds with a penalty continues to be kept up in public legislation, and men in their private dealings adhere to ancient forms, the mutual observance by the parties of such formality materially influences the construction to be given to the contract. There arc many cases, where on the question of intention the construction turned, to a greater or less degree, upon the adherence to the form of a penal bond with a condition, or the use of the word penalty, or penal sum. <em>Smith vs. Dickinson, </em>3 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. </em>630. <em>Davis vs. Renton, 6 B. &amp; C. </em>216. <em>Tayloe vs. Sandeford, <a href="/us/20/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="7 Wheat. 13" data-case-ids="1503000" data-case-paths="/us/20/0013-01">7 Wheaton </a></em><a href="/us/20/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="7 Wheat. 13" data-case-ids="1503000" data-case-paths="/us/20/0013-01">13</a>. <em>Perkins vs. Lyman, </em><a href="/mass/11/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="11 Mass. 76" data-case-ids="2053405" data-case-paths="/mass/11/0077-01">11 <em>Mass. </em>76</a>. <em>Merrill vs. Merrill, </em>15 <em>ib. </em>488. <em>Stearnes vs. Barrett, </em><a href="/mass/18/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 Pick. 443" data-case-ids="2070942" data-case-paths="/mass/18/0450-01">1 <em>Pick. </em>443</a>. <em>Brown vs. Bellows, </em>4 <em>ib. </em>178. <em>Robeson vs. Whitesides, </em><a href="/serg-rawl/16/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="16 Serg. &amp; Rawle 320" data-case-ids="1816640" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/16/0320-01">16 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>320</a>. <em>Abrams vs. Counts, </em>4 <em>Ham. </em>214.

      <em>Pnl. </em>346, that “where articles contain covenants for the perform anee of several things, and then one large sum is stated at the end, to be paid upon breach of performance, that must be considered as a penalty,” though often quoted, furnishes a rule of very limited application to such contracts. It is demonstrated by the subsequent cases in England that it is no objection to an agreement for stipulated damages, where there are several acts to be done or abstained from, because they appear to vary in importance. Unless the right of parties so to contract is denied, the only effect of such a rule would be to require parties to be more specific in making the stipulation apply to the breach of each separate undertaking. In <em>Kemble vs. Farren, 6 Bingham </em>141, the agreement provided for mutual acts to be done, of different degrees of importance, some of them being the payment of small sums of money by way of salary, with a clause, “that if either of the parties should neglect or refuse to fulfill the said agreement, or any part thereof, or any stipulation <em>therein contained, </em>such party should pay to the other, the sum of 1000 L., to which sum it was thereby agreed that the damages sustained by such omission, neglect or refusal should amount: and which sum was thereby declared by the said parties <em>to be liquidated and ascertained damages, and not as a penalty, or penal sum, or in the nature of one.” </em>The draughtsman of this instrument certainly had endeavored to take the distinction adverted to by Ld. Tenterden in <em>Davis vs. Renton, </em>between a penalty and liquidated damages, and though it was likened to <em>Astley vs. Weldon, </em>C. J. Tindall, put the case upon the ground, equally applicable to <em>Astley vs. Weldon, </em>that by it a large sum of money might become payable in consequence of the non-payment of a smaller sum. So that, however clear the intention of the parties might be, as expressed, it was not allowable for them to contract in that way. The decision in <em>Boys vs. Ancel, </em>5 <em>Bing. N. C. </em>390, really turned upon the same distinction, because either party might have become liable to pay the sum of 500 L., as stipulated damages, in default of paying a trifling amount, being his part of the expense of having the papers prepared. To the same effect is <em>Horner vs. Flintoff, </em>
      <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>9 <em>Mees. </em>&amp; <em>Welsby </em>678. In <em>Atkyns vs. Kennear, </em>4 <em>Exch. </em>776, the defendant was bound by the covenant to do and abstain from various things, and of varying importance, for any infringement of which he was to pay the plaintiff 1000?. as liquidated damages. The breach alleged was, that the defendant, contrary to the agreement, had resided within a prescribed distance. Parke B. thought that the covenant against mere residence within the prohibited limits, would be good, and it was immaterial whether the plaintiff had sustained any damage fi-om the breach of it or not, because the non-performance imports damage; and, he with the rest of the court, wholly disregarded the circumstance that, in that case, some of the covenants seemed to be of minor importance, provided the damages resulting from any breach of them would be uncertain, and the parties had chosen to attach consequence to a breach of them, even to the extent of 10,000?.; because, as said by Aederson B., “We cannot say they are wrong inasmuch as the damages are uncertain.” While this case, on the whole, concedes the authority of <em>Kemble vs. </em>Farren, by referring it to the principle that damages cannot be stipulated for the non-payment of a lesser sum; and upon the question of intention, that where the amount stipulated for the breach of several covenants is a penalty as to any one, it is to be construed as a penalty for all, it is a distinct, and strong affirmation of the untrammelled right of parties to stipulate for damages in all cases where it is lawful to do so.</p>

In <em>Baird vs. Tollion, </em><a href="/tenn/25/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="6 Hum. 186" data-case-ids="11266704" data-case-paths="/tenn/25/0186-01">6 <em>Humph. </em>186</a>, the defendants received of the plaintiff four five per cent. State bonds, to be returned within twelve months, orpay him $4,000. On a suspicion of usury, which was not pleaded, the court appear to have treated the alternative sum as a penalty, though in the absence of any proof showing that the transaction was a cover for usury, it would be questionable if it ought to have been presumed, because, whether the receipt of the four thousand dollars, in State bonds, was a loan or sale of them, on time, the transaction might be a fair one, as an exchange of securities, where the plaintiff lost the interest, and the defendant ’took upon himself the risk of appreciation of the State bonds.According to the authority of that case there were lurking penalties in <em>Gregory vs. Bewley, </em><a href="/ark/5/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="5 Ark. 318" data-case-ids="8727259" data-case-paths="/ark/5/0318-01">5 <em>Ark. </em>318</a>, <em>Hoys vs. Tuttle, 3 Eng. </em>125, and <em>Bizzell vs. Blevins, ib. </em>138, where the substance of the contract was to pay a certain amount of Arkansas Bank notes, • by a given time, and in default of doing so; to pay a like sum in. money, and they were held to be undertakings in the alternative-to deliver property or pay money.</p>

The difficulty arises out of those cases where the courts have undertaken to judge of the contract, whether the sum stipulated be reasonable or unreasonable for the parties to have agreed to, and presume their intention to have been accordingly. <em>Dennis vs. Cummins, </em>3 <em>John. cases </em>297, <em>Curry vs. Larer, </em>3 <em>Barr. </em>340, <em>Spencer vs. Tilden, </em>5 <em>Cowen </em>144, adopted in <em>Watts vs. Shepherd, </em>and <em>Perkins vs. Lyman, </em>are of that character.

In <em>Perkins vs. Lyman </em>it is intimated that in the construction of contracts, in order to determine between a penalty and liquidated damages, the court may be aided by circumstances extraneous to the writing. We apprehend there ought to be no difference between this and any other species of contract, where the writing furnishes the rule of interpretation, subject to the explanation of latent ambiguities, or the meaning of the words with reference to any local usage. If a defendant could show a clear case of stipulated damages to be a penalty, he could only do so on the principle that a party may go into equity to have a conditional sale established as a mortgage. When the execution of the contract is denied, or it is impeached for want of consideration, or for usury, for overreaching or fraud in any of its protean shapes, all the attendant circumstances and inducements-are opened for proof, and then, any apparent inequality or gross unfairness on the face of the contract, would aid the proof of extrinsic facts in order to raise the presumption of fraud.</p>

It would be true that, where the damages stipulated to be paid to the vendor exceeds the price agreed upon for the property, it would be void as a compensation, and could only stand as a penalty for the non-payment of a lesser sum. That was the case in <em>Moore vs. </em>Platt, 8 <em>Missouri </em>467. But the case of <em>Glosson vs. Beadle, </em><a href="/johns/7/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="7 Johns. 72" data-case-ids="369119" data-case-paths="/johns/7/0072-01">7 <em>John. </em>72</a>, seems to go an extreme length 'the other way. There the defendant sold the plaintiff a tract of land for $500, and agreed to make him a good title to it within a year, or in lieu thereof to pay him $800. There the contract had been executed on the part of the plaintiff, by the payment of the purchase money, and the decision that he was entitled to recover the $800 as liquidated damages, could perhaps be upheld on the supposition that the vendor meant to stipulate a certain amount of damages, in case the title failed, to <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>cover improvements made by the vendee during the year, instead of a return of the purchase money with interest, the ordinary measure of a breach of warranty, and in that view it was a proper subject for stipulated damages.</p>

The truth is, the real object of every stipulation for consequential damages, is to secure the performance of the contract itself, and but for the confusion of terms, it would be proper to say, that covenants to pay a certain amount of damages for the breach of any undertaking have, to the extent that they are allowable, taken the place of penalties; the only broad distinction being, and which prevails in chancery as .at law, between penalties or forfeitures for the non-payment of money, and those which are incurred by the failure to perform any other collateral act.</p>

The word “forfeiture,” in the connection where it is used, obviously means a failure to comply with the agreement. It is true the parties have not used the term, stipulated or liquidated damages, expressive of a clear intention to negative the idea of a penalty; but on the other hand, the instrument hasnottheform of apenalbond, where the sum specified would exceed, being usually double the amount or value of the subject to which the contract related; and on the <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>whole, we think these parties intended that the sum of five hundred dollars was to be paid by either party to the other, as an agreed compensation for such damages as would result from a refusal to comply with the trade.
