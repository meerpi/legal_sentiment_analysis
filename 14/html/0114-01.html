Newton, to whom he executed and acknowledged a deed.

The first of these replications concludes to the country the second, with a verification. And issues being taken upon them, they were submitted for trial to the court sitting as a jury.

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the court should have presumed in favor of the regularity of the proceeding from the sister State.

It is conceded that the bid was made by Johnson, and it is not shown that the sheriff was aware that the State had any interest in the bid uuless after <em>the </em>second sale of the property; but so far from this, the sheriff, in his answer under oath, positively de nies all knowledge of the fact until after the second sale: And this answer must be taken as true, because it is not questioned by replication, nor is it disproven by other evidence. The sheriff thus is cut off from all knowledge of the acts of the State. He could not request her to pay, because she was unknown to him; and for the same reason an ability or readiness to pay by the Bank, not having been brought home to the sheriff, amounted to nothing. Thus left with Johnson, as the only known bidder, who refused to pay the sum bid, the sheriff, in obedience to the statute, re-offered the property, and sold it to a second bidder, who paid the sum bid to the sheriff. This second sale was a revocation, under authority of the statute, of the first bid; and no act of Johnson’s after that time could restore him to the rights which he had lost by refusing to pay the sum bid when called upon.</p>

    <p id="b121-5" data-blocks='[["BL_121.5",121,[212,660,1205,760]]]'>The deed subsequently found in the possession of Johnson, bears date eight days after the second sale of the property, and, if the contents of the deed are to be received as evidence, it must be taken all together, and would <em>show prima facie </em>a deed signed and delivered to Johnson at that date. If so, it was an act not warranted by law, and of course would not be consummated by acknowledgment, by the sanction of a court. Under the circumstances of the case, after the sale to Newton, the first bidder stood in no better situation than any one else; his bid was forfeited; there was no bid; a mere stranger had as much right to demand a deed as he had. But the sheriff positively denies the execution of the deed, and there is no proof of its execution except that arising from presumption: but if there was proof upon this point, it would not avail.</p>
    <p id="b121-6" data-blocks='[["BL_121.6",121,[210,1432,1199,926]]]'>It is not true, as the counsel for the State seem to suppose that the sheriff may charge himself with the sum bid and dispense with the payment of the money. This question was discussed at length in the case of <em>Dickson vs. </em>Gilliland, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Cow.%20498" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="1 Cow. 498">1 <em>Cow Rep. </em>498</a>. In that case the sheriff received a large amount of the money and made a deed to the junior lien creditor under the New York statute. The first purchaser, at the expiration of the time allowed him to redeem, claimed a deed, and it was ordered to be made to him, upon the ground that the sheriff had no right to make the deed until the whole of the purchase money was paid. The policy of the law forbids that sheriffs should be permitted to substitute themselves as debtors to the creditor. But even if this was permitted, it is evident that no court would compel the sheriff to do so. Nor will the readiness of the State to pay authorize a deed after the second sale, because the sheriff has exhausted his power and authority by a sale, and the receipt of the purchase money under it.'</p>
