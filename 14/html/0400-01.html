The exceptions taken before the Probate Court present the only questions for our consideration'. They relate alone to the right to dower in the slave Cato, <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>and in respect to the hire of the slaves. The defendants admit that Cato was <em>one </em>of the slaves inventoried, and held <em>by </em>them for a time as part of their intestate’s estate; but set up in avoidance or excuse for not accounting for the slave, that by an order of the Probate Court, he was discharged from their custody!. If such was really the case, and if the Probate Court had power to order such discharge, as this was affirmative matter, with regard to which the defendants’ answer could not be received as evidence, (See <em>Scott, White </em>&amp; <em>Co. vs. Henry </em>&amp; <em>Cunningham, </em><a href="/citations/?q=13%20Ark.%20121" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="13 Ark. 121">13 <em>Ark. Rep. </em>121</a>,) the defendants should have introduced the record, or other competent evidence to prove that fact. As this appears not to have been done, that slave stood in the same situation that the other slaves did, and should have been taken into account in decreeing dower. The defendants did not attempt to' account for the hire of the slaves; indeed, they assume that they were, under the circumstances, not bound to account for hire. They admit that the slaves belong to the estate and were held and controlled by them, but state that the slaves were most of the time, kept upon the intestate’s farm at work, and that they accounted for the proceeds of their labor in their settlement with the court; that they were induced to pursue this course, because it had been pursued by their predecessors in administration, and because they were so requested to act by the widow, (the claimant for dower.)</p>

The proceeds of the labor of the slaves, whether employed on a farm or otherwise, is not the measure of the1 admin-tors’ accountability, but the ordinary value of the services of tbe slaves at hire. This Is the only safe standard of accountability easily to be arrived at by putting slaves to public hire upon notice, or by proving the rate of hire for such slaves at a given time. The proceeds of the labor of the slaves is so dependent upon the Mnd of labor to which they were put, their management, the <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>value of produce, and like considerations, as to render it extremely difficult to arrive at any just estimate of the sum so realized, and is unwarranted by the’ nature of the trust reposed in the administrators. If (as alleged) the widow did sanction and direct the course pursued by the administrators, so far as they pursued such direction, they may be protected, as against her claim to dower, to a stricter account. But of this there is no evidence ; nor is there any evidence of the amount realized from the labor of the slaves. Reference is made in defendants’ answer to a settlement made with the court, in which they charge themselves with the sum so received, but such settlement is not made an exhibit, nor is it to be found in this record <em>; </em>nor is there evidence here to be found sufficient to take an account for hire, or to assign dower except as to the slaves.</p>
