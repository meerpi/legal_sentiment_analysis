Availing themselves of this act, they executed the bond upon which this suit was brought. The bond is made payable to the State for the penal sum of $3,933. And, after reciting that the principals had become security for Ilickey, as collector, that he had made default, &amp;c., that there remained due and unpaid, from him, on account of State revenue the sum of $1042 75, and for county revenue,the sum of $'925 73, and the act passed for their relief, it was conditioned to be void, if the principals should well and truly pay into the State treasury, and into .the county treasury, respectively, the sums above specified, with interest, on or before the first day of November thereafter.</p>

    <p id="b173-5" data-blocks='[["BL_173.5",173,[244,537,1212,1259]]]'>The statute, Digest, title, Penal Bonds, provides for three distinct classes of cases, and the mode of proceeding in each is differently regulated. The first four sections relate to actions founded on bonds conditioned for the payment of a less sum of money. The sections from five to fifteen, apply to suits on bonds for the breach of any condition other than for the payment of money. Sections fifteen <em>et seq. </em>regulate the mode of proceeding in suits on official bonds ; including those of administrators, guardians, &amp;c. It is only in the last two classes of cases, where the judgment is by default, or on demurrer, that a jury must be called, unless waived, to enquire into the truth of the breaches assigned, and assess the damages, and when, as decided by the cases referred to, such should be the form of the oath administered to the jury, in compliance with the statute. But upon the reading of the statute those provisions have no application to actions on bonds, conditioned for the payment of a less sum, and where the amount due is ascertained, or ascertainable by computation from the face of the instrument itself, as is the case here. In all such cases the penalty is inserted rather as an adherence to ancient form, and not because it is an essential part of the contract; and while no good reason can be imagined for the intervention of a jury to assess the damages, the statute is not so unreasonable as to require it.</p>
