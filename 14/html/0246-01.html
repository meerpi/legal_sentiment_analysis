    <p id="b249-6" data-blocks='[["BL_249.7",249,[237,691,1211,926]]]'>This cause was brought here from the chancery side of the Independence Circuit Court, on the separate appeal of Walker. The original bill was filed on the 13th day of March, 1847, by Ichabod M. Manning, against Walker, as administrator of James Pope deceased, and against William Byers : alleging that a certain partnership, which he particularly set out, had existed between himself, Byers and Pope, in his lifetime, from the 12th of February, 1838, when it was formed, until the 24th of March, 1841, when it was dissolved by mutual consent, and when an account, which he to some extent set out, was stated between the partners, and the assets of the concern turned over to Pope and Byers to reduce to money, and pay towards the partnership liabilities, and account for the balance, if any, and praying an account and a decree for whatever sum should be found due to him, against Byers and Walker, as administrator of Pope, the latter having departed this life about the middle of July, 1845, soon after which time Walker administered upon his estate.</p>
    <p id="b249-7" data-blocks='[["BL_249.8",249,[238,1629,1201,373]]]'>Byers answered, admitting many of the material facts, and ex j hibiting very fully and particularly the alleged stated account, at the time of the dissolution, all the liabilities of the firm, and its assets of every description, and the manner in which they had been disposed of, and showing a considerable loss upon the whole transaction, alleged that he was the sufferer, and prayed relief against both Manning and Walker, as administrator.</p>
    <p id="b249-8" data-blocks='[["BL_249.9",249,[236,2016,1199,267]],["BL_250.1",250,[191,344,1203,1404]]]'>Walker, as administrator, answered also, denying all personal knowledge of any of the matters stated in the bill, refusing to admit any thing, and requiring strict proof, prayed to be dismissed with his reasonable costs. Issues having been formed and depositions taken, the cause first came on to be heard at the <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>June term, 1848, when, an account was decreed, and the matters referred to the master. At the March term, 1849, the master reported, and at the same term Byers filed his cross bill, to which Walker interposed by answer, the failure of Byers to authenticate his supposed claim, as provided by the statute; the special statute of non-claim, and the general statute of limitation, and denying the allegation, and requiring strict proof, prayed again to be discharged with his reasonable costs. Manning also answered the cross bill, and issues having been formed, the entire cause was heard at the September term, 1850, and the court not being sufficiently advised what decree to render, took time to consider until the 12th of January following, when at a special adjourned session, a final decree was rendered in favor of Byers, against Manning, and against Walker, as administrator, from which the latter appealed to this court. From the foregoing statement of the case, it will be observed that the original bill of Manning was filed about six years after the dissolution of the partnership, and about one year and a half after the, grant of letters of administration to Walker, on the estate of Pope. This original bill was not sworn to. Pope died about four years and four months after the dissolution of the partnership, and Walker 'administered upon his estate about six months afterwards. The answer of Byers to the original bill of Manning, was filed about five days before the expiration of two years from the granting of letters of administration to Walker. This answer was sworn to in the usual manner.</p>

The decree appealed from is that rendered by the court below, against Walker, as administrator, and we shall first enquire' whether or not that decree was authorized by the cross bill. We shall do so, because in the solution of that question we shall at once get at the real point of law involved in the case. To the cross bill, it will be remembered Walker interposed, by his answer, the three fold defence, that the alleged claim of Byers was not au<a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>thenticated against him as administrator, in the manner provided by the statute, and was barred both by the general statute of limitations, and by the special statute of non-claim.</p>

Beyond this, however, and in combination with these principles, our Legislature has incorporated into this system a safe guard against fraudulent claims, and against collusion, between fraudulent claimants, and the representative of estates in requiring an affidavit from every claimant, which contemplates not only the protection of the just creditor but the distributee. And indeed, the last remark, as to the distributee, is applicable to the whole machinery of our administration system, which, in hedging out the evils of delay so inseparably connected with the settlement and distribution of estates, under the old law, as well as in all its other main objects, looks not alone to the interest of creditors, but has regard also to the interests of the heirs, or distributees, who are often minors, dependant upon the residue of the estate for support and education.</p>

Accordingly we adopt this construction of the statute, and the consequence is that even in a case where the contract is in writing, and as against a living person, when the foundation of a suit, could be read in evidence without proof of its execution, unless denied by sworn plea, as provided by the statute, it could not yet be read in evidence, (even if its execution were proven, as at common law), in a suit in the Circuit or Probate Court, against an executor or administrator, until the authentication had been made to appear of a date before the commencement of the suit, in which it might be offered in evidence.</p>

Does the general statute of limitations give the rule, or the statute of non-claim, or both in combination? As all ■claims, not exhibited within two years from the granting of the letters, are to be forever barred, it follows that however long a claim may have to run under the general statute, it cannot sustain it even one day beyond the end of the two years, and therefore, it is that to this extent at least, the general statute of limitations is displaced by the special statute of non-claim, because of the inconsistency of the two rules, unless the latter could come in like a proviso and cut the former down. And if, in the onward course of the general statute of limitation, it would run out on a given claim the same day that the two years would expire, which would be a case in principle like where the general statute was cut down by way of such a proviso as that supposed, one or the other would be useless, because they would both perform the same office in sustaining the claim in full life, if it be true, that both are applicable. But it is not true in such a case <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>that they both perform the same office, because the claim is sustained in full life, not because an action was commenced upon it, within a certain time after an action accrued, but because it was exhibited before the end of two years after the granting of letters. If it had not been exhibited within this two years, it would have been barred, however short the time since an action had accrued, or although no action at all had accrued, upon a debt not yet due, but running to certain maturity. It would seem then clear enough that, in such a case as this also, the rule of the general statute of limitation was displaced by the rule of the special statute of non-claim, because the former could be of no use at all to either party, there being no place left for its operation, either in itself or in combination with the special statute of non-claim.</p>

The statute of non-claim is itself but a statute of limitation, and is nothing else. The most plainly marked distinction, that has ever been drawn between them by the adjudged cases, was that the executor or administrator was bound to plead the statute of non-claim, but could plead the general statute of limitation or not at his election. And this was based upon the ground that statutes of non-claim were for the benefit of estates, and of creditors and heirs, interested in them, and that the executor or administrator was a trustee" for them. But even this distinction may be challenged as sound law, the learning upon which it is based being as well applicable to the general statute of limitation as to the special statute of non-claim, and is parcel <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>.of the exploded idea, that an executor or administrator may revive a debt against his testator or intestate, by a part payment, pr an express new promise at least, which grew up under a theory, that regarded the executor as the owner of the estate, and responsible not only to the extent of assets, but to a greater extent, if he did not show in defence that he had fully administered, ,and therefore cannot be tolerated in a system where, for most purposes, he is regarded only as trustee, or assignee, and cannot bind the estate by any contract of his own, and where nothing short of a contract by the party to be boupd, can revive a cause of action barred by the statute of limitation. But while the nature of the two statutes is identical, the rule given by each is essentially different. The one bars causes of action, if the suit be not commenced within a given time after accrual; the other, having a wider scope, bars all claims and demands, without regard to the time of accrual of the cause of action, if not <em>exhibited </em>within a fixed period of time. The statute of non-claim is like the statute of limitations that existed in early times in England; before the first general or prospective statute, in being temporary, and in running off from a fixed point of time; as from the first landing of 'King Richard, the 1st, and not unlike our earlier pre-emption laws.

Although the principle, for which the case of <em>Aiken vs. Baily </em>(5 <em>Eng. R. </em>584), was cited as authority in that case, is undoubtedly sound, and is applicable not only to the general statute of limitation, but also to the statute of non-claim, in a proper case, as where the first administrator might die, or resign within the two years, and some time might elapse before a second administrator should be appointed, the time during which there was actually no administrator, would not be computed as a part of the two years.</p>
