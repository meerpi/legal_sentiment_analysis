The Circuit Court denied the relief and dismissed the bill for want of equity.

That decision, likely to be attended with some unfortunate consequences, was overruled upon solemn consideration in the subsequent case of <em>Wilson vs. Biscoe et al., </em>6 <em>Eng. </em>44, where it was holden that the assignees might well foreclose those mortgages for the failure to repay moneys borrowed from the Bank on stock credit, and sell the mortgaged lands, subject always to the ultimate and paramount lien of the State and the bondholders.</p>

That the purchase money not being paid to McLain, Tucker, on the 2d day of November, 1840, conveyed the said lands to one Sterling H. Tucker, in trust among other things to pay the purchase money due to McLain, which was a lien on the land. That pursuant to such deed, the Trustee, on the 9th April, 1842, sold and conveyed the lands mentioned in it to the respondent, wherefore he claimed to be sole proprietor of the lands, but if mistaken in that, he claimed that the original purchase money, which he had paid upon his purchase from the Trustee to satisfy McLain, should be a charge upon the lands and refunded to him.</p>

The only land he alleges that Tucker bought of McLain is the NE qr. sec. 19, a tract not embraced in the Bank mortgage. He professes to exhibit McLain’s bond for title to Tucker, but does not do so, and there is no proof whatever concerning it, when or upon what conditions it was executed, or when assigned to Wright, and none of the witnesses ■who depose about the sale from McLain, refer to any title bond, •or identify the tract in question. It does appear from the proofs .on the record that, on the 2d day of November, 1840, Tucker conveyed to a Trustee the NE qr. sec. 30 and the SE qr. sec. 19, with power of sale, to pay in whole, or <em>pro rata </em>certain debts therein recited, and among them a note to the State Bank made by Tucker with McLain, as one of the securities, and it further appears that Tucker had bought a tract of land from McLain, but what tract is no where shown, and paid for it by the proceeds of a discount in the State Bank of his own note with McLain as .security, and which note McLain was afterwards obliged to take up. And also that, on the 9th of April, 1842, the Trustee sold the lands mentioned in the deed of trust to Wright in consideration of his paying to McLain the amount due him for said lands, and the further consideration of $250 paid to the Trustee, and Wright paid the debt to McLain, by taking up his note in the State Bank for $1,400, and refunding to his administrator the sum of $500 previously'advanced for interest and curtails, in all $1,900.</p>
    <p id="b520-5" data-blocks='[["BL_520.6",520,[127,1889,1190,376]]]'>Now, upon the case presented, the additional matter relied on by Wright in opposition to the foreclosure amounts to nothing. But supposing that Tucker had purchased one or more of the tracts of land embraced in the mortgage to the Bank, from McLain, taking an ordinary bond for title on payment of the purchase money, the claim of Wright in opposition to the mortgage would hardly be entitled to any serious consideration.</p>
    <p id="b521-4" data-blocks='[["BL_521.4",521,[194,357,1195,482]]]'>
      <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>Upon the hypothesis most favorable to him, the transactions were, that Tucker mortgaged to the Bank land to which he had only an equitable title, McLain having a prior lien for the unpaid purchase money. Then Tucker conveyed the land intrust with power of sale for the payment of certain debts of his, and among them that for the original purchase money. Wright bought the land under this deed of trust, the proceeds of the sale going to extinguish the debt for the purchase money, and also took from Tucker an assignment of McLain’s bond for title.</p>

    <p id="b521-6" data-blocks='[["BL_521.6",521,[189,1021,1205,1310]]]'>When he made the deed of trust he conveyed only such interest as he then had left, being what the court, in <em>Brown vs. Morrison, </em><a href="/ark/5/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="5 Ark. 223" data-case-ids="8726926" data-case-paths="/ark/5/0223-01">5 <em>Ark. </em>223</a>, call “the equity of an equity, or in other words, a right of redemption still remaining.” If McLain had assigned to Wright a note of Tucker for the purchase money, it might have resulted that such assignment carried with it the right to subject the land to its payment as a prior incumbrance. If Wright, being the security of Tucker for the purchase money, had been forced to pay it, that being the condition only 'upon which the vendor could be required to part with the title, the security thus paying might have a claim in equity to be subrogated to the vendor’s lien. But the object and effect of the sale under the deed of trust was to pay McLain and extinguish that lien, Wright comes in as a stranger or volunteer, the same as if he had bought the land directly from Tucker on the 2d of November» 1840, subject of course to all incumbrances. If by the terms of that purchase, Wright having so agreed, did accordingly pay off the original debt to McLain, the result would be the same as if Tucker had himself discharged that debt out of the proceeds of the land, or any other means of his. Tucker could not for any purpose, sell or assign any greater interest than he himself had in the land, and the only effect of extinguishing the prior lien, which he was legally and equitably bound to do, or cause to be done, was to let in the mortgage as the next oldest incumbrance.</p>

The <em>statute Digest, </em>title Chancery, <em>sec. </em>138, provides that upon the hearing and determination of appeals in chancery, the Supreme Court, if it shall reverse the decision or decree of the Circuit Court, shall make such decision, order or decree with costs, as the Circuit Court ought to have made, “which when certified to the Circuit Court shall be entered up as the decision, order or decree of said court, and shall be carried into effect in the same manner as if the decree had been made by the Circuit Court.” Whatever may have been the former practice of this court, and which, indeed, has prevailed and been acquiesced in since its organization, we must conclude that the clear and explicit language of the section quoted, makes it incumbent upon this court to render a final decree upon reversal, in all chancery causes brought here by appeal, whenever it appears that the cause was in a condition to have been finally heard and disposed of in the court below.</p>
    <p id="b522-4" data-blocks='[["BL_522.5",522,[239,1595,1189,429]]]'>We add this qualification because there may be instances where this court, owing to its peculiar organization, not having original jurisdiction in such cases, but authority only to hear and determine the appeal <em>de novo </em>upon the law and facts, just as it was heard and submitted in the court below, might think proper, and within the spirit of the statute, instead of making any final decree to remand the cause upon an issue or reference to ascertain a necessary fact, or upon some further equitable directions.</p>
