At the July term, 1852, of the Probate Court, the clerk produced the will, together with the proofs taken before him in support of the same. Jester Cornelius, who was one of the executors named in the will, appeared and resisted the probate, filing various exceptions thereto. The exceptions being considered, were overruled by the court, which proceeded to adjudge that the probate of the will in question, as taken and made before the clerk in vacation, be approved and confirmed; that the letters of administration granted to the contestant be revoked, and letters testamentary issued, or in lieu thereof, letters of administration with the will annexed, in case the executors named should refuse to act. Jester Cornelius excepted to this decision and appealed to the Circuit Court, which being of opinion that there was no error appearing in the judgement of the Probate Court, affirmed the same; and from the decision of the Circuit Court he has appealed to this court.</p>

It is made the duty of the clerk in vacation, as well as cf the.Probate Coui’t, when informed of the existence of a will, to issue process to compel its production in order that it may be probated.

      <a id="p679" href="#p679" data-label="679" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*679</a>The constitution indicates the court of probate as the proper forum, where provision should be made by law, for the determination of all controversies respecting the validity of wills, with the right of appeal as in other cases. No good reason is perceived why this should not be so : and in this country, where all courts are statutory, there is no foundation for jealousy between common law and chancery or ecclesiastical jurisdiction, nor is-there any substantial reason, in the supposed superiority of the landed interest, for excluding the salutary jurisdiction of chancery, in cases proper for its interposition, by making the validity of wills affecting real estate triable only at law. Yet the statute, <em>Digest, </em>Title, Wills, <em>sec </em>32, <em>et seq., </em>contemplates an issue, upon-petition in the Circuit Court, to be tried by a jury, and treated as a common law proceeding, as the proper, if not the only conclusive mode available to any person interested, for establishing or' rejecting any will, which had been previously rejected or established by the court of probate; while at the same time the proceedings before the Probate Court, as well as its clerk in vacation, appear to be summary and <em>ex </em>parte; nor did the original re-visors of the statutes make any provision for an appeal from the" decision of the Probate Court, in establishing or rejecting a will.It is true, by <em>sec. </em>176, <em>Title, </em>Administration, appeals are allowed1 from all orders revoking letters testamentary or of administration, but that obviously relates to cases where the executor or administrator may be removed for alleged misconduct and the like,- and could hardly be construed to include a case like the present,, where the accidental circumstance exists, that the appellant having been appointed administrator, as in cases of intestacy, was' necessarily superseded by the establishment of a will brought to-' the notice of the Probate Court.</p>

Though possibly as the law now stands, this result might follow: that an unbidden suitor in the Probate Court, would be concluded by the adjudication, to which he had chosen to make himself a party, should he afterwards attempt to assert the validity or invalidity of the same will by an independent proceeding before the Circuit Court.</p>

The two subscribing witnesses appeared before the clerk, who caused their testimony to be reduced to writing, signed by them, and which he certified in accordance with the statute. To one of those witnesses he propounded certain interrogatories, some of which are clearly leading. However improper such a mode of examination may be, even when conducted by a disinterested officer, in the discharge of his duty, and objectionable unless the leading questions are explanatory, or allowed, in the discretion of the court or officer, to be put to a reluctant witness, the objection made here is not available to the appellant, because the testimony of the other witness, given in the form of a statement, and to whom the interrogatories do not appear to have been addressed, is full and conclusive as to all the points relied on to establish the will, and corroborative also of the witness, who responded to interrogatories.</p>

The facts are, in this case, that after the testator made his mark, the two attesting witnesses walked out into the gallery, or entry as one of them calls it; and signed their names as witnesses, and which, as they state, was done merely for convenience. It does not appear whether the testator could have seen them if he had desired to do so. However desirable it might always be, when practicable, to have the attestation of a will completed by the signatures of the witnesses in the presence of the testator, it is not necessary to its validity under the statute of 1839, as held in <em>Rogers vs. </em>Diamond, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Ark.%20486" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="13 Ark. 486">13 <em>Ark. </em>486</a>.

The language of the statute <em>sec-. </em>4, is that every will “must be subscribed by the testator at the end of the will, or by some person for him, at his request.” The succeeding section 5, is as follows: “Every person, who shall sign the testator’s name to any will, by his direction-, shall- write his own name as a witness to such will, and state that he signed -the testator’s name at his request.” The first clause quoted seems to have been retained from the Territorial Statute, <em>Steele &amp; McCamp. Dig. Title, </em>Winns, <em>sec. </em>1, which required the will to-be signed by the testator, or by some other person in his presence and by his direction; while section 5 is taken.from the New York Statute, before referred to, which, without any express provision, that the testator’s name may be signed for him.-by another person, implies that in case of a will, as in other acts-, what is done by the direction of the testator is done by him, inasmuch as it provides, that “the witnesses to any will shall write opposite to their names, their respective places of residence; and every person, who shall sign the testator’s name to any will by his direction, shall write his own name as a witness to the will. Whoever shall neglect to comply with either of these provisions, shall forfeit fifty dollars,” &amp;c. But such omission shall not affect the-validity of any will-; nor shall any person, liable to the penalty aforesaid, be excluded or incapacitated on that account, from testifying respecting the execution of such will.” The entire section quoted explains itself; but the partial, and, we had almost said, inconsiderate adoption of it in- our statute has a very different effect: and there is no room to doubt, that where another person signs the testator’s name by his direction, the will is invalid unless such person shall also write his own name as a witness: in other words, the requirement of the statute, that the witness in such case shall also write his own name, is not merely directory, to secure better evidence of the due execution of the will, but is a necessary ingredient of the attestation itself. Where this requirement is wanting, the paper not being holographic, might perhaps., under certain circumstances, he established as a <a id="p683" href="#p683" data-label="683" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*683</a>nuncupative will, but for all other purposes, it would be an attempt at testamentary disposition, the same as a paper without any subscribing witness, though in fact executed and published, <em>animo tcslandi, </em>in the presence of witnesses.</p>

And in view of the peculiar phraseology and context of the statute, requiring, as it does, but two witnesses, making acknowledgment by the testator equivalent to subscription, dispensing with the ceremony of simultaneous attestation by both witnesses at the time of subscription or acknowledgment or a subscription by either witness in the presence, actual or constructive, of the testator, it must be conceded that the intention, to be gathered from it, is doubtful. The argument, on the one hand, is that the power of testamentary departure from the usual and equitable course of descents and distributions, and which incites fraud by its unavoidable association with unpaired judgment and enfeebled will of the testator, ought to be strictly pursued. And we are warned, by the successive deviations, tolerated and afterwards regretted by eminent judges, from the statute of Chas. 2, and which could only have been allowed by construit4g the statute to mean, that it was not so much the will or paper itself that was to be attested, but the act of the testator in executing and publishing it as his will, to adhere to what seems to be the policy indicated in the changes made by our own statute.</p>

It is to be presumed that our statute was enacted with a knowledge of the statute of 29 of Car. 2, and the construction put upon it in England, and by the courts of this country upon similar statutes, as adopted in the several States. Under that statute, which authorized the will to be signed by the devisor, or by some other person in his presence, and by his direction, it has been uniformly held that a signature of the devisor by making his mark, is good. And it was not so held because that was the only mode in which ignorant persons, otherwise capable of devising, could sign. There might be an obvious propriety in allowing a devisor, exhausted by sickness, to sign by a mark. In <em>Baker vs. </em>Denning, 8 <em>Adol. &amp; Ellis, </em>94, where the question was, for the first time, made in England, whether a de visor, who could write, might sign by his mark, from .choice, and without any apparent necessity for doing so, it was held to be a sufficient signing, though with some hesitation. Mr. Justice Patterson, however, said, “If it be once conceded that a mark by way of signature, is a signing within the act, it is too much to say that in every particular case, we are to enquire minutely into the ability of the party to write his name. It would be inconvenient to enter into such a question, and there is always the attestation: so that when a mark appears, there are means of enquiring into the circumstances; and the enquiry in such a case is, of course, more close than in ordinary cases. But I am not prepared to say, that a man may not, at any time, sign by merely putting his mark, whether he can write his name or not.” So, the attestation by the mark or initials of a subscribing witness was held good in <em>Harrison vs. Harrison, 8 Vesey J. </em>185. <em>Addy vs Grix, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Ark.%20486" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="13 Ark. 486">id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=13%20Ark.%20486" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="13 Ark. 486">504</a>. Notwithstanding what Lord Hardwick said in <em>Grayson vs. Atkinson, </em>2 <em>Vesey sen. </em>459, that the statute requiring the will to be signed undoubtedly meant some evidence to arise <a id="p685" href="#p685" data-label="685" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*685</a>from hand writing, there seems to be no adjudged case in England under the statute, that a will may not be made or attested by persons, who do not write their names, and he was there speaking of signing in opposition to sealing. It is true that Mr. Justice Washington, in the case of <em>Stevens vs. Vancleve, </em>4 <em>Wash. Ct. Ct. </em>269, arising upon the New Jersey Statute, which required the will to be signed by the testator, omitting the words, “or some other person in his presence and by his express direction,” argues in favor of a mark being a good subscription by a testator; because the statute could not have intended to deny the privilege of making a will, to those who from accident, disease or want of education, could not write. And the argument may be good for that purpose, without leaving it to be inferred that the testator must write his name in all cases, where he may be able to do sol The recent English statute of 1839, applying to real and personal estate, does not differ materially from that of 29 of Car. 2, and the interpretations put upon it, except in these particulars; that it must be signed by the testator at the foot or end, and that such signature, or the testator’s acknowledgment of it shall be made before two or more witnesses present at the same time. Under this statute also it has not <em>been </em>doubted that a signature by initials or mark of the testator would be good. In <em>the goods of </em>Savory, 6 <em>Eng. Law. &amp; Eq. </em>583. <em>In re Field, </em>3 <em>Curteis, </em>752. <em>In re Bryce, </em>2 <em>ib. </em>225.</p>

Our statute evidently uses the words, subscription and signing at the end as synonymous. In <em>Chaffee vs. Baptist, Miss. Con. </em><a href="/citations/?q=10%20Paige%20Ch.%2089" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="10 Paige Ch. 89">10 <em>Paige </em>89</a>, Chancellor Walworth did not hesitate to say that the testator might subscribe by making his mark, and it was not necessary that he should be able to write his name, though the statute also recognized the mode of the testator’s name being subscribed for him by his di<a id="p686" href="#p686" data-label="686" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*686</a>rection. In <em>Butler vs. Benson, </em>1 <em>Barb. Sup. Ct. Rep. </em>533, the court, in giving a summary of their statute, say: “The testator must subscribe his name at the end of the will, which may be by his autograh, or by his mark, or if he is unable to write, by another in his presence and by his express directions.”</p>
    <p id="b686-4" data-blocks='[["BL_686.5",686,[166,641,1196,1258]]]'>Our statute, which undertakes to remedy some of the evils growing out of the decisions under the statute of Charles 2, by requiring subscription at the end of the will, and publication or some declaration by the testator, at the time of subscription or acknowledgment, of his knowledge of the testamentary character of the instrument, and an attestation by witnesses at his request, as an equivalent for the security afforded by their attestation in his presence, or according to the late English Statute, their simultaneous attestation, does not in other respects differ from it. It allows the testator to subscribe by another person for him at his request. There is no indication in it, that a testator, who from ignorance or physical inability is unable to write his name, or from choice, may not well subscribe by making his mark or his initials, which is vouched for by the attestation of the witnesses, sufficiently clear <em>to </em>change the rule <em>of </em>law as heretofore understood. And we think we are giving full effect to the 5th section above quoted, by holding that when the testator’s name is signed to a will by his direction, and he does nothing more, thereby adopting such signature as his subscription, in such case the person, so signing for the testator, must also write his own name as a witness, and state that he signed the testator’s name at his request, and that it ought not to apply to a case where the testator does himself sign though by making his mark.</p>
