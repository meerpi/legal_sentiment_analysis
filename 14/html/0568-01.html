John Q,uillin, Circuit Judge, at the May term, 1851. The material facts are, that, on the 8th of October, 1841, the Real Estate Bank recovered a judgment against Naborne T. Nelson, Charles T. Nelj son and Robert Carrington, upon which a <em>Ji. fa. </em>issued and was levied on two slaves of Naborne T. Nelson. A delivery bond was given by the defendants and Ambrose K. Ellett as their security, which was forfeited and judgment rendered thereon at the April term; 1842, of the Circuit Court, without notice and on mere motion. At the May term 1843, a <em>revocation </em>of the judgment was entered under the act of 7th January, 1843, and judgment anew rendered on the delivery bond. An execution was issued on this last judgment, which was levied upon lands of N. T. Nelson, which were appraised; but were afterwards sold under para<a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>mount claims. Naborne T. Nelson died previous to 1844, and administration on his estate was granted on the 26th of August 1844. The two negroes, for which the delivery bond was given, were sold by the administrator for payment of debts on the first of January, 1846, and purchased by the defendants, Draper and Williams, at public sale, without actual notice of the levy or delivery bond. The bill was filed by the Trustees of the Bank, on the 30th August, 1849, to obtain payment, praying that their lien on the slaves be enforced by way of foreclosure, that they be sold to satisfy the judgment, and for general relief.</p>

The act of the Legislature of 7th January, 1843', authorizing the Circuit <em>Courts to </em>recall judgments on delivery bonds, was pronounced unconstitutional and void by this court, in <em>Byrd vs. Brown, </em><a href="/citations/?q=5%20Ark.%20710" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="5 Ark. 710">5 <em>Ark. </em>710</a>, chiefly on the ground that the General Assembly possessed no power to authorize a Circuit Court to revise its own judgments- rendered at a previous term. Nothing need be added to the reasoning in that case, because if any proposition is self-evident, it is, that if the Legislature can confer on the Circuit Courts authority to revise one class of erroneous judgments, the same power may be conferred in all cases, and thus effectually deprive this tribunal of its appellate jurisdiction granted by the Constitution. This cannot be done, and hence recalling the previous judgment and entering judgment anew on the delivery bond, were proceedings <em>coram non judice; </em>and consequently the execution which issued on this new judgment, the levy on lands, their appraisement and offer for sale, were mere nullities, and must fall with the judgment, because no valid thing can spring from a void thing. And this brings us to the first judgment on the delivery bond rendered in 1842. It was taken on mere motion, without process or notice, without detailing the facts otherwise than in the judgment itself, and was undoubtedly so erroneous, as to have been reversible on error, in a direct proceeding for that purpose, if that remedy had been sought by either party. It was, however, <em>voidable </em>merely, <em>not void; </em>and according to the doctrine in <em>Borden vs. The State, </em>6 <em>Eng. </em>519, must be regarded by this court as a valid judgment, since the court pronouncing it was a superior court in contemplation of law, and had jurisdiction over the subject mat<a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>ter. There is then no alternative but to treat it as a binding judgment.</p>

This doctrine has been approved by this court in the cases of <em>Ashley vs. Hyde, </em>1 <em>Eng. </em>100; <em>Cossitt vs. Biscoe, </em>7 <em>Eng. </em>95, and <em>Rawdon vs. Rapley, </em>14 <em>Ark., </em>and has become the settled law of this tribunal.</p>

Ellett as security, and this bond was forfeited and judgment rendered on it, as stated, in 1842, for the whole debt; the slaves levied on having been of that value. The question then is directly presented as to the effect of a levy and delivery bond on the original judgment, and the difference between a simple forfeiture not pursued to judgment and an actual judgment on the delivery bond. And to a proper understanding of the subject in all its bearings, it will be necessary to advert to the previous and present law concerning delivery bonds, noting such differences as may exist, but still regarding those laws as forming one system, according to the ancient rule of exposition, that acts <em>in pari materia </em>are to be construed together.</p>

All these proceedings were had when the above section was not in force; and as the counsel for the appellants admit, that if there was no statute providing that the lien should remain, and the sheriff seize and sell without process, the lien of the levy and the sheriff’s title are absolutely discharged by giving a delivery bond: we might say shortly that there being no such statute, when the proceedings were had, it would follow on their own reasoning, that there was no lien on the slaves levied on, to be asserted or pursued, and that the court very properly refused to recognize or enforce it, especially after such a lapse of time, and against <em>bona fide </em>purchasers at a public sale, who have ever been, and ought to be favorites of a court of equity, and whose titles or possessions are not to be disturbed except upon the strongest and most conclusive grounds, and certainly not on astute constructions, doubtful implications, or stale claims. There can be no question but that it is sound policy, as well as the duty of courts to strongly incline to uphold sales, made under the authority of law, and protect the title of puz’chasers, because prudent men az’e not disposed to risk their money in so precarious an izivestment as the purchase of law suits; and if szich a policy did not prevail the sacrifice of property at judicial sales would be as ruinous as it would be inevitable. But that proposition admits of a more conclusive answer, which is, fiz-st, that after the delivery bond the shez’iff has no title to the goods of any sort, and the levy is released; and second, treating that section as not repealed, the effect would be the same,because in the constz’uction of statutes, every part must stand it possible and that could only be effected, in cases circumstanced as this is, by holding that their lien could subsist no longer than the judgment remained in foz’ce, and that if the plaintiff should abandon the original judgment and obtain a new judgment on the bond in cases where the property levied on was of equal value with the debt, he must abide by all the consequences flowing fz’om that step; which have been declared <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>to be, that the original judgment was thereby extinguished, its lien merged in the new judgment, and such lien as arose from the levy released and forever discharged, and the execution end-' ed.

The statute fails to define exactly how long the lien of a levy, so called, shall last, or when it shall end, but that and the subsequent section authorizing the seizure of that or any other property of the defendant to satisfy the execution, when the condition of the bond was broken, and selling personal property on short notice, indicate clearly enough, when taken together, that the lien could not subsist, when the old was merged in the new judgment, since the accessary must follow' the principal. <em>Harrison vs. Wilson, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.K.%20Marsh.%20551" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="2 A.K.

And the reason of the rule is that the law', condemning a multiplicity of suits, which too often unnecessarily harrasss a defendant, will not as it has been said, suffer two subsisting judgments on the same cause of action against the same individual. Nor does this at all conflict with the rule, that a party, having several subsisting remedies, may pursue any one or all of them until he obtains actual satisfaction, <em>(Taylor vs. Thomson, </em>5 <em>Peters, </em>369); for that rule is not to be shaken or weakened.</p>

This can never occur under the existing law, <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>because the bond covers the whole debt, irrespective of the value of the property. The expression in the statute, that the “levy shall remain a lien upon the property,” means no more than that there is a lien upon it, not substantially different from that general one which an execution creates upon being placed in the hands of the officer. It does not mean that the property is in legal custody, or does not belong to the defendant in the same manner as his other personal property, and the authority to seize it, “into whose possession soever the same may have passed,” was intended to guard against fraudulent alienations; but not to inhibit <em>bona fide </em>sales before execution executed. The provision, that “no execution shall be a lien,” but from the time such writ •shall be delivered to the officer,” (Digest, 498), has been repeatedly held not to alter the property of the goods until the execution is executed, (<a href="/citations/?q=12%20Johns.%20406" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="12 Johns. 406">12 <em>Johns. </em>406</a>; 4 <em>East, </em>536), and so, on a parity •of reasoning, the provision above alluded to would have no greater effect. And this exposition we conceive to be in exact accordance with the policy of the law, which does not encourage liens •on personal property when the possession is parted with, be-, •cause such liens are of a secret nature, and tend to embarrass and obstruct the free alienation of property, <em>so </em>necessary in the trade and commerce of men. They open the door to the perpetration of frauds on innocent persons, and owing to the mobility of personalty, nothing can be more uncertain than such liens and in no case should they be extended or enlarged by judicial construction, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20Wend.%20483" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="26 Wend. 483">26 <em>Wend. </em>483</a>. In point of dignity and certainty they are not like liens on real estate created by judgments, or evidenced by recorded mortgages, for these are public and notorious, and preserved in the records of the country, to which all have access, and of which all are bound to take notice, in all cases where the law makes such 'records operate in that way.</p>

When a party voluntarily parts with the possession of the property, upon which a lien has attached, such lien is divested, because it has been well said, that if it was to follow the goods after they had been sold or delivered, the incumbrance would become excessively inconvenient to the freedom of trade, and the safety of purchasers. 1 <em>Stra. </em>536; 1 <em>East. </em>14; 2 <em>East. </em>235; 7 <em>East. </em>7; <a href="/wend/26/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="26 Wend. 467" data-case-ids="2028371" data-case-paths="/wend/26/0467-01">26 <em>Wend. </em>467</a>; 7 <em>Eng. </em>572. It has been said by this court that the lien is only co-existent with the possession of the article, and being once surrendered, cannot be revived by any subsequently acquired possession. 2 <em>Eng. </em>256. It is true that this doctrine, arising from a different lien, could not apply in terms, but only by analogy to the lien of an execution, and to what we consider as the same in effect — the lien of a levy, since the latter too originates under the execution and stands on the same footing. The Legislature therefore might not have thought it labor thrown away to exclude the conclusion that might otherwise have been drawn from the restoration of possession to the defendant.</p>
