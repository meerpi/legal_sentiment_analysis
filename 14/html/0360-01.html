Gray, who was a brother-law of the defendant, had sent him to Nashville, to perfect and complete his education, and paid all the expenses and charges attending the same, which were allowed him in the settlement of his accounts, had ceased to be guardian on the 13th of January, 1842, on the ward’s reaching the age of twenty-one, and had turned over to the ward his property, the complainant alleged, in substance, that he never had any transactions with, nor did he ever owe Ellison anything individually; that in 1840 the defendant wrote one or two letters to the complainant, claiming compensation for the board of George M. Gray, to the amount of about forty dollars, to which the complainant replied by letter, that he expected to receive a large sum of money for the use of his ward, and if the account was sent duly probated, he would pay it out of his own funds: that in 1843 Ellison visited Hempstead county, where complainant resided, and saw him on many occasions, but that no claim was prefered or mentioned by Ellison, and complainant supposed that it had been adjusted by Gray, and gave himself no concern about it; that in October, 1845, the complainant visited <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>Nashville, Tennessee, and was there served with a writ requiring him to answer said Ellison to a plea of debt, and in which writ the complainant was described to be “Guardian of George M. Gray;” that he consulted an eminent lawyer in Nashville, and truly represented to him all the material facts of the case, who assured the complainant that the action could not be maintained nor a recovery had, without proof that he was still guardian of Gray, and the attorney pledged himself to attend to and defend the action; and see that the necessary proof was adduced to defeat it, in the event there should be no failure of evidence on the part of the plaintiff; that knowing that the claim was unfounded and never could be proven, and relying on his attorney to defeat the suit at the trial, he gave no further attention to it, and heard nothing more from it until 1849, when an action was brought on the judgment, which appeared to have been rendered for $174 debt, and $53 damages and costs; that his attorney, “either by fraud and collusion with said Ellison, or from some unaccountable conduct,” failed to appear and defend the suit as he had promised to do, and judgment was rendered against the complainant by default, without the intervention of a jury, or the production of any evidence whatever to establish the demand.</p>

But the defence set forth in the bill was not of that character. It was purely legal, unaccompanied by equitable circumstances, and no sufficient excuse has been stated to show why it was not made in the suit in Tennessee. The complainant was not ignorant of the facts on which the defence rested, for he avers that he communicated them fully to his counsel, and was informed by the latter that the action could notbe maintained, and he chose to rest easy on that advice. No accident is pretended to have prevented it, and fraud and collusion are distinctly denied and not proved. The claim for relief is narrowed down to the common case of a person, who having a strict legal defence, neglects to make it at law, and thus forever loses its benefit. Even if a retainer had been proved and gross' negligence in the counsel, unaccompanied by fraud, or unfairness, still to attempt to relieve from its consequences would be to venture into a vast ocean of litigation without chart or compass to guide us. It would, in fact, amount to an extension of privileges to one class of persons, which are denied to others, thus destroying that equality which is the boast of a court of equity, and should never be lost sight of in its decisions and decrees.</p>

The bill, taking every statement on that subject to be true, fails to show due diligence on the part of the complainant; but, on the contrary, evinces that he gave himself no concern about the suit, and never attempted to furnish evidence, if any existed, to prevent a recovery, and certainly that was not the duty of the attorney. It is a cardinal rule in equity, commended by its good sense, that no man can be relieved from the consequence of negligence, carelessness or inattention; because to do that would be to make litigation endless, rob the vigilant of their advantages, and overwhelm courts of equity by the pressing multitude of slothful suitors. In their organization courts of equity are properly and necessarily vested with a large discretion, but still it is a discretion depending on established arid well defined principles, and in every view of the subject, it is clear that the complainant was not entitled to the relief prayed for in his bill, and the same should have been dismissed.</p>
