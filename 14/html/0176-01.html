    <p id="b174-12" data-blocks='[["BL_174.15",174,[170,1819,1197,479]]]'>In this case the defendant pleaded the statute of limitation, to which the plaintiff filed five replications : each admitting that more than three years had elapsed between the time her cause of action accrued, and the commencement of the suit; and relying upon the provisions of the 24th sect. Dig. ch. 99, which provides that where an action is commenced before the cause of action is barred by limitation, and a non-suit is suffered, that such plaintiff may commence a new action within twelve months after such non-suit suffered, &amp;c.</p>
    <p id="b174-13" data-blocks='[["BL_174.16",174,[215,2311,1146,45]],["BL_175.1",175,[254,354,1203,926]]]'>The first and second of these replications no where aver <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>against whom the first, or the several succeeding suits, after non-suit, were commenced; and although the third replication properly describes the cause of action and the parties in the first suit, and that a non-suit was suffered, it wholly fails to show against whom the second suit was commenced. The fourth replication was withdrawn ; the fifth replication avers that after the first non-suit, the plaintiff commenced her action anew, “ with intent to implead the plaintiff, J. W. Wilson and Thadeus C. Wilson.” Conceding this to be a clerical misprision, and that the pleader intended to say “defendant,” instead of “ plaintiff,” and the averment was in fact, that she <em>intended </em>to implead the defendant, J. W. Wilson and Thadeus C. Wilson, or the defendant, and the others, still the averment is insufficient. It is not enough to say that the plaintiff <em>intended to sue, </em>but there must be a direct averment that she did sue, &amp;c. Each of these objections is fatal under the decision of this court in the case of <em>The Bank vs. Sherrill, </em>7 <em>Eng. </em>186.</p>
