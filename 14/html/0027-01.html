The defendant, Lee, pleaded <em>nul tiel record </em>and <em>payment </em>upon <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>which issues were joined. The defendant, Fowler, pleaded in abatement; first: that at the time of suing out the writ of <em>scire facias, </em>there was no such person in being as the plaintiff, Bolinger: second, that the <em>scire facias </em>was issued more than ten years after the rendition of the judgment, without any leave of the court being obtained for its issuance: third, that it was so issued without any previous motion in court, supported by affidavit that the judgment still remained unsatisfied. A demurrer being sustained to the plea in abatement, no further defence was interposed by Fowler. Upon the trial of the issue on the plea of <em>nul tiel </em>record interposed by the defendant, Lee, the court rejected the record offered in evidence by the plaintiff, to prove the recovery recited in the writ; and the record so offered is set out in the bill of exceptions taken by the plaintiff.</p>

We cannot know what record of the original recovery may have remained in the court below, except so far as the bill of exceptions has made it a part of the record sent here. The only evidence appearing in the bill of exceptions, is what purports to be the record entry of a judgment entered <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>as of a previous term in favor of Bolinger <em>v. </em>Fowler and Lee, as his security in appeal, but no other proceedings are shown, nor does it appear in what court, or at what time the judgment was rendered. Conceding every thing in favor of the jurisdiction of the court rendering the judgment sought to be revived, both as-to the subject matter and the parties, the omission to produce a record of a recovery corresponding in date with the judgment, as recited in the <em>scire facias, </em>amounted to such a variance as would authorize the court below to reject <em>the </em>evidenced</p>

But being sued jointly, whether in any ordinary action, or by <em>scire facias </em>is immaterial, if the defence be such as necessarily enures to the benefit of both defendants. So that, when Lee had 'judgment in his favor, upon the plea of <em>nul tiel </em>record, both defendants must have been discharged from the action.</p>

See 1 <em>Chitty Plead. </em>448, and cases cited. Any objection to the plea because not sworn to, was only available on motion to strike out or disregard it. If the facts be well pleaded, the office of a demurrer, which admits them to be true, is to question their legal sufficiency.</p>
