The declaration contains the common counts for goods sold and delivered, money paid, for interest and on account stated. The only evidence adduced to sustain the action was the deposition of a witness, taken in New Orleans, who states, “that the account marked <em>A, </em>hereto annexed, showing a balance due to Hill, McLean &amp; Co., of five hundred and forty-seven dollars and fifty cents, by Edmond P. Rucker is correct;” and he also annexed to his deposition the invoices marked B, and three hills of lading marked 1, 2 and 3. The same witness further stated that it is customary for commission merchants to charge eight per cent, interest on open accounts. The ac count exhibited shows the total amount of debits, as stated by the witness, but there are no credits appearing, so as to make that amount a balance, or from which any recognition of the correctness of the account by the defendant could be inferred. The exhibit B consists of bills of goods, some of which appear to have been consigned to A. Hays, Napoleon, for account of E. P. Ruck-er, Rucker’s Landing, Arkansas river; and another portion to J. A. McAlister &amp; Co., Nashville, for account of E. P. Rucker. The copies exhibited of the bills of lading, show that certain goods were shipped by Hill, McLean &amp; Co., at New Orleans, some of <a id="p708" href="#p708" data-label="708" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*708</a>them on the Cotton Plant, marked “E. P. Rucker,” and consigned to Hays, at Napoleon, and another portion on the Harry Hill, marked “M. L. Rucker, Murphreesboro, Tennessee,” consigned to McAlister &amp; Co., at Nashville. In the account, the items are charged during the month of July 1847, the invoices are without date, and the bills of lading are dated in November and December, 1847. The plaintiffs also proved, by another witness, that the defendant, Rucker, was a planter on the Arkansas river in the year 1847. This being all the evidence in the case, the court instructed the jury, that they should find for the defendant, unless the plaintiffs have proven either that the defendant ordered the goods, or that he received them, and that the shipment of the goods and taking bills of lading therefor, in the manner shown by the deposition referred to, is not sufficient evidence of a receipt of them by the defendant, but there must be proof of an actual receipt of the goods by him, if they were not ordered.</p>

But to instruct the jury to find as in, case of non-suit, is only the opinion of the court.that the plaintiff has failed to make out his case in evidence, and so far from taking the case from the jury is every way favorable to the plaintiff, because it is analogous to a demurrer to evidence, where all-legitimate presumptions of fact are to be indulged in favor of the evidence.</p>

In this case the real truth may be, that the defendant was resisting payment of a just demand, and that the apparent inconsistencies in the deposition could have been reconciled and any defect of proof supplied by further testimony; but according to the case presented on the record, the jury could not-have been justified by the evidence in finding a verdict for the plaintiffs, and consequently the expression of such an opinion by the court was erroneous. The statement of the witness who deposed that the account exhibited showing a certain balance due the plaintiffs from the defendant was correct, might have been honestly made, as appearing to him from the books of the plaintiffs; but it cannot be stretched to mean that the witness was personally cognizant of the transactions about which he testified, or to amount to proof that the defendant, not shown to have received the goods, had ordered or bargained for them, so as to be1<a id="p710" href="#p710" data-label="710" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*710</a>come chargeable for their value by the delivery of them to a carrier.</p>
